    <title>Honor 50 review: lose a Huawei, gain a Google</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Google’s software makes the Honor 50 a contender rather than competitive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kUBDaT"&gt;It’s rare that you need to get into geopolitics at the outset of a smartphone review, but it’s impossible to avoid with the Honor 50. It’s the first Honor-branded device to release outside of China since the brand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;spun out from parent company Huawei last year&lt;/a&gt;. It means that despite Huawei’s continued presence on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;USA’s entity list&lt;/a&gt;, Honor is now able to include Google’s apps and services on a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bho8iK"&gt;Having access to these services, which include critical parts of the Android ecosystem like Google Play in addition to apps like Google Maps and YouTube, means that the Honor 50 is the first Honor phone in years to actually have a shot at being a viable purchase for customers outside of China. Its midrange starting price of €529 (about $616) doesn’t hurt, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVw4Hm"&gt;But while leaving its former parent company has opened a Google-shaped window for Honor, it’s also closed a Huawei-shaped door. Honor is now on its own, without the backing of one of the most well-resourced technology companies in the world. As a result, while not a bad phone, the Honor 50 ends up not feeling competitive with other handsets in its price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MhIbgR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7L1usZ"&gt;The Honor 50 starts at €529 (around $616) for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which is the version I’ve been using, but stepping up to €599 (about $698) gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Regardless of which option you go for, you get the same Snapdragon 778G processor and a 4,300mAh battery that can be fast charged at up to 66W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NC0vPA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You get the choice of 6 or 8GB of RAM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NjxZsU"&gt;Honor’s phones have always been available with loud designs, and the Honor 50 is no different. My model came in a shiny white colorway, with the letters “HONOR” tiled across its back, and there’s also a garish sparkly silver color option available alongside more conventional black and green options. While I don’t love the color options, I think Honor deserves credit for its approach to the dual-ring camera bump on the Honor 50, which is a lot more interesting than the generic rectangles found on the backs of most devices (Huawei’s Nova 9 uses a very similar design, which Honor says is because the design was developed before the split).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVMwc7"&gt;Around front, the Honor 50 has a 6.57-inch 1080p OLED display, with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a small centrally orientated hole-punch notch for the phone’s 32-megapixel selfie camera, which moderately curves around the left and right edges of the phone. I can’t fault the screen’s rich blacks or vibrant colors, and the under-display fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive. If you don’t like curved displays, then you won’t like the Honor 50’s, but at least the phone doesn’t suffer from any palm-rejection issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t82WZd3sISbJxPFlNaKC4jF-PuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963228/jporter_211025_4826_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A curved screen might not be to everyone’s tastes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d-r-IsZluIIa_rXonBd_Y9D03Ss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963226/jporter_211025_4826_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like the camera bump more than the color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y7l4aF"&gt;The Honor 50’s screen has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes it feel fast to use and smooth to look at, and the Snapdragon 778G processor happily keeps up, even while the screen quickly scrolling through visually intensive apps like Twitter. I had no problems with performance during my time with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjJhn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no IP-rating and no wireless charging&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TggGOl"&gt;The rest of the specs are more basic. There’s no IP rating for dust and water resistance and no wireless charging, and when it comes to audio, the phone outputs sound from a basic downward-firing speaker. It’s loud enough for listening around the house, but you’ll be reaching for a pair of headphones in noisier environments. Honor includes a pair of USB-C headphones in the box, which is fairly unusual these days, and almost makes up for the lack of a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulJlYu"&gt;Honor’s Magic UI software, which runs atop of Android 11 on the Honor 50, is broadly inoffensive. However, it has its annoyances and, by default, is set up in a way that I think most people are going to want to tweak. For starters, it uses Microsoft’s SwiftKey rather than Google’s Gboard keyboard that I think most Android users will be more familiar with. There are also a ton of stock Honor apps that I disabled in my first couple of days with the phone, and I don’t love the way Honor’s software defaults to eschewing Android’s typical app drawer for an iOS-like homescreen. It’s easy enough to rectify with some tweaks, but it feels a little cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eq6YfkE9SHvOAV1u0qIM91qD_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963224/jporter_211025_4826_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone has four rear cameras in its camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tsf43s"&gt;I had no complaints with the battery life of the Honor 50, averaging a little over seven hours of screen on time between charges. I never had to put the phone on to charge at the end of the day with less than 40 percent charge remaining. The Honor 50 supports 66W fast charging via an included charger that’s branded as Honor’s own “SuperCharge” charging standard, which isn’t compatible with third-party chargers. Honor claims the included charger can get the phone from 0 to 100 percent charge in 45 minutes (unfortunately, my review sample came with an EU plug, so I was unable to verify this claim myself). But a full charge in under an hour is nothing to be sniffed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S043nr"&gt;The headline camera specs of the Honor 50 appear to be impressive at first glance, but the devil’s in the detail. Yes, it’s a 108-megapixel quad-camera array, but there’s no telephoto camera, and beyond the main sensor, the three additional cameras are a comparatively low-resolution 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5rzBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10834528"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AH69Sq"&gt;Things don’t get off to a great start with the Honor 50’s main camera. Even in daylight, there can be a distinct lack of detail in its shots, like in the shot of the black cat above, where there’s very little definition or texture in its fur. Colors are vibrant at the risk of being a little oversaturated, and faces come out looking a little too bright and textureless. White balance is at least pretty natural, and I think selfies come out generally looking OK, helped by the fact that there’s an easily accessible shortcut to turn on background blurring and a beauty mode slider (if that’s a feature you’re interested in). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caOsnn"&gt;Low light performance leaves a lot to be desired, where the Honor 50 produces shots that are dark and muddy. But the bigger problem is that the phone takes way too long to take photographs in low light. When trying to take a shot of a group of people at a party, the Honor 50 refused to take a photo for several agonizing moments, which is far longer than people at a party are willing to wait to have their photo taken for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVLEUhGmjx-P5x--gjLjWPl3NmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963229/jporter_211025_4826_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C and bottom-firing speaker, but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/648NqA0oDE6Rqeo032kNax-Cqm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963225/jporter_211025_4826_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 120Hz display is hard to fault.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9VgiQb"&gt;At its starting price, the Honor 50 is a comfortably midrange device. But there are a lot of accomplished smartphones available at similar prices. Phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; (€499 for its step-up 12GB RAM / 256GB storage model) or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; (€539 for its 128GB storage variant) are both excellent phones that offer a much more rounded experience than the Honor 50. And if you’re considering the Honor 50 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, then you’re just €50 away from the recently announced Pixel 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFEUIv"&gt;It’s a crowded part of the market, and simply having access to Google’s apps and services isn’t enough to make an impact. Honor’s software can feel bloated, and its camera is sluggish and lacking in detail. Speedy 66W fast charging and a slick 120Hz display aren’t enough to distract from the fact that the Honor 50 has some weak spots when compared against the best midrange handsets available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="jX6wqK"&gt;Honor might be a viable purchase now that it can once again include Google’s apps and services on its devices. But it has more work to do if it wants to be truly competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="VegvPD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10834541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Cricket Wireless removes speed caps from several plans and offers 5G to everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SPAIN-TELECOM-WMC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lfQs7GcvbqyYi3yy4Rxla4kgcNQ=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062348/1233713968.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uzij4E"&gt;Cricket Wireless suddenly has several more options if you’re looking for access to 5G on a prepaid wireless plan. That’s because starting today, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fthe-cricket-connection%2Fsubscriber-milestone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it will offer nationwide 5G access across all of its plans&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397001/cricket-wireless-5g-samsung-att"&gt;launched a year ago with support for only one device&lt;/a&gt; and only on its more expensive unlimited plans. Cricket Wireless also revealed it’s added 2 million customers in the last two years and is now serving some 12.4 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzFH24"&gt;The other big change for Cricket Wireless is removing an 8Mbps speed cap on its cheaper $30, $40, and $55 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fcell-phone-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt;. How much bandwidth Cricket Wireless can reliably provide — using AT&amp;amp;T’s network — after the caps go away is something we’ll only find out as people try it out. Reading the fine print at the bottom of the announcement points us to Cricket’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fmap.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;coverage map&lt;/a&gt;, as well as lists of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fsupport%2Fgreat-big-network%2F5g-compatible-phones.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;compatible 5G devices&lt;/a&gt;. It also points out that the $55 per month plan still carries a stipulation that “Cricket may temporarily slow data speeds if the network is busy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnyUSw"&gt;Of course, the benefits customers see from 5G, no matter which wireless carriers they use, have been pretty disappointing so far. With the changes, now you can potentially get 5G access for as little as $25 per month, per line, on a plan with four phone lines. And with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s plan to expand the reach of its mid-band 5G connections over the next couple of years&lt;/a&gt;, even if things aren’t significantly faster for you right now, that could change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to buy the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6O_8_WhCd5DAKdSh1bdXxl0zUk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016186/bfarsace_211014_4802_0013.10.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now buy Google’s newest Pixels, pending availability.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p512wU"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22514428"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt;, and are now up for order. These Pixels promise new designs, new cameras, a uniquely designed Google Tensor CPU, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57DFat"&gt;This year’s Pixel phones come in two sizes: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;the standard Pixel 6 and the larger, triple-camera equipped Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The base Pixel 6, with 128GB of storage, starts at $599, while the Pixel 6 Pro runs $899 and up if you prefer to go above the base 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="samX3I"&gt;What’s new&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTBVbQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; look mostly nothing like prior iterations, with a metal-and-glass design highlighted by a rear camera bar that is slightly reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9571535/nexus-6p-review"&gt;classic Nexus 6P&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller Pixel 6, which cannot truly be considered small by any stretch of the imagination, has a 6.4-inch, 2400 x 1080 OLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The larger Pixel 6 Pro stretches its legs with a 6.7-inch, 120Hz LTPO OLED display with 3120 x 1440 resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzGN0n"&gt;On the inside, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google’s brand-new Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt; powers both, while the Pixel 6 gets 8GB of RAM and the 6 Pro has 12GB. The new chips have a lot to prove for Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;just as the new camera systems do&lt;/a&gt;, with the Pixel 6 housing a dual-camera setup and the 6 Pro adding a third camera and lens to its rear bar. The phones match each other with 50MP main cameras and a 12MP ultrawide, but only the Pro counterpart gets a 48MP sensor complete with telephoto 4x optical zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpMCfQ"&gt;Time will tell if all this hardware and new camera software brings the Pixels back to the top of the pack, but in the meantime, let’s look at how the Pixel 6 phones are configured and made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x26RG3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the Pixel 6 compares to the Pixel 6 Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22724481/google-pixel-6-pro-specs-comparison-price"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="af9xF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qoPTwM"&gt;Where to buy the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3iYB8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google kicked off orders first on its own store&lt;/a&gt;, right as the phone became official. Now we’ve reached the launch date for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, though, like most phone launches these days, there are some shipping delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="In20xd"&gt;Currently, &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google’s store&lt;/a&gt; indicates that some models of the Pixel 6 Pro are out of stock or have long delivery times. This seems to affect the unlocked model the most, which is listed as out of stock with only an option to be added to a waitlist for some configurations. There are some Verizon and Google Fi models available in the Google Store, and the current stock shortage is not yet affecting the regular Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO9lWc"&gt;We will update this post as more options become available, but we can immediately see how some models are not available everywhere — if a 512GB Pixel 6 Pro is your jam, your only option is to purchase an unlocked one from Google once it’s in stock. As far as general availability at retailers, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO5wFAh05o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-5g-unlocked-128gb%2F-%2FA-84683612%3Fpreselect%3D83607398%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergepixel6preorders" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1665071-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02900_us_pixel_6_dual_sim_128gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; all have some Pixel 6 availability, but Pixel 6 Pros are mostly unavailable or sold out. Unlocked models seem to have the greatest scarcity, with better chances of getting a carrier-locked version. The carrier stores seem to have higher stock levels, so if you want to get the phone as soon as possible, it might be your best chance — particularly if you want the Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FfBJXi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBa1GT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815902"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHSBMR"&gt;Carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qBhCBk"&gt;If you’re not shopping for an unlocked phone and prefer to utilize promos and payment plans from your carrier, there are some offers from the likes of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Google’s own Fi service. Bear in mind that carriers give discounts as bill credits over time, attempting to rope you into service for 36 months or more. The Pixel 6 models offered from &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; (including Verizon models bought on Google’s store) have radios for mmWave 5G, which cost upward of $100 more and still may not give you faster speeds depending on where you live and use the phone. Pixel 6 Pro phones, unlocked or bought through a carrier, work with mmWave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bskHg6"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fwxgST"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is offering up to $700 off the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-128gb-cloudy-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a qualifying trade-in for new and existing customers, and 50 percent off of any Google-branded accessories purchased simultaneously. The base &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; 128GB model costs $15 per month over 36 months without a trade-in, but keep in mind that the mmWave-equipped model AT&amp;amp;T is selling is fully priced at $740 and not the base $599 of unlocked models using only Sub-6 5G. The $15 per month over 36 months will result in a total price of $540, reflecting the $200 AT&amp;amp;T will discount over time via bill credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="X9W7Oc"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pPtJqr"&gt;Verizon’s offers are similar promo, with up to $700 off a &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a trade-in— though this is limited to new customers switching over. Existing customers can get up to $350 off when trading in a phone and upgrading a line. If you’re shopping for more than one Pixel device, you can buy one and get a second Pixel 6 or 6 Pro for up to $700 off (given to you in billing credits over time; you’ll pay in full upfront) with eligible unlimited plans. The base Pixel 6 on a payment plan from Verizon will run $23.33 per month for 30 months, totaling $700 and a one-time $35 activation fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74YwEQ"&gt;If you want to buy a Pixel 6 for Verizon’s network &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;direct from Google&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll also receive up to $100 in Google store credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="O5sVYL"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hVohEb"&gt;T-Mobile is advertising the base &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%3Fsku%3D810029932646&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; as free with a trade-in on its Magenta Max plan and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%3Fsku%3D810029931533&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; up to $900 off under the same terms. Once again, these promotions involve buying the device as a Magenta Max subscriber or purchasing that service, paying the sales tax, trading in a qualifying phone that T-Mobile will offer a value on, and then receiving the allotted money back as monthly bill credits over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bpnx5n"&gt;Note that T-Mobile’s offerings for the Pixel 6 does not have a mmWave radio, only Sub-6 5G, and is thus the respective $599 base price as Google advertised. T-Mobile’s price for the Pixel 6 Pro also matches Google’s $899.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will arrive with a day-one update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpk4c4JfW3PHhZKTdttIMKn8QzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050227/bfarsace_211014_4802_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KAHsOx"&gt;Assuming you managed to order a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, then you should know that once the phone is in your possession, you’ll need a little extra time to get everything set up and working. That’s because, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/132599975/update-your-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-to-the-latest-software-to-get-all-the-features"&gt;as a post on the Google support forums points out&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/26/pixel-6-day-one-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), there is a software update to install. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqmypE"&gt;The post indicates you’ll need it to get all of the features, although it’s unclear what would be missing if you simply started using the phone without it other than the November security update. According to Google, the build number is the same for both phones, and it should display SD1A.210817.036 or SD1A.210817.036.A8 for Verizon customers. If your phone arrives early, then the update might not available at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBbf5b"&gt;According to our team, all the review units are running the same build present after the device installs its day-one update, so any impressions you see here or elsewhere are using the same software. For a device that must be connected to a network, this approach isn’t surprising — it allows production to ramp up even as the launch software is finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ikbi0b"&gt;The day-one update installs after you complete your device setup, and Google says it can take about 25 - 50 minutes to download and install in the background. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are scheduled to start shipping on October 28th, so first-hand experiences with the update (and our reviews of both phones) aren’t far away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T 5G Plus expansion plan highlights how much its mid-band coverage trails T-Mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JFEkF5TRi-tYKnit7lVEJt_rsSo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048196/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VXRhNn"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s new 5G Plus expansion gives T-Mobile the perfect “I told you so” moment. AT&amp;amp;T currently offers two “flavors” of 5G: 5G Plus over the high-band mmWave spectrum and regular 5G, which is comparable to 4G LTE. Now, &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2021/c-band-5G.html"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; details AT&amp;amp;T’s plan to roll the mid-band spectrum it owns into 5G Plus, conflating its fastest but hard-to-find 5G with a new variant that has a better chance of both range and speed — the kind of 5G that T-Mobile has been focused on from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeC7jf"&gt;Former &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8930691/tmobile-ceo-trashes-verizon-att-5g-plans"&gt;T-Mobile CEO John Legere slammed AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; for not having a mid-band spectrum in 2019, stating that 5G needs a low-band, mid-band, and high-band spectrum to work efficiently. This is because that high-band mmWave 5G offers the fastest speeds over shorter distances, making it best for highly concentrated areas. Conversely, low-band 5G provides the bare minimum for speed over wider areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPfrcQ"&gt;Offering 5G service with no in-between isn’t ideal — a mid-band range serves as the median between both spectrums. Until this year, T-Mobile was the only major carrier with access to the entire range of spectrums. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T invested nearly $70 billion&lt;/a&gt; combined to gain access to the C-band spectrum in February, making both companies two years behind T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SSTPo9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dear wireless carriers: the 5G hype needs to stop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cs5mIe"&gt;Testing performed earlier this year by &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the difference so far in the carrier’s approaches. In one year, T-Mobile saw its average download speed, as tested, skyrocket past the average speeds from Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, even though Verizon’s maximum speed was much higher. According to &lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;, testers could consistently reach speeds between 150Mbps and 500Mbps on T-Mobile’s network using the mid-band spectrum, providing a sharp difference from the capabilities of 4G wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6zg4o"&gt;As AT&amp;amp;T’s blog post explains, the carrier estimates that by the end of 2022 its US rollout will cover 70 to 75 million people, and by the end of 2023, it will cover over 200 million. T-Mobile managed to reach some 125 million people with its “Ultra Capacity 5G” using mid-band spectrum last June, says it will reach 200 million people by the end of this year, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fneville-ray-future-of-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F26%2F22746708%2Fatt-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;claims that it can cover 300 million by the end of 2023&lt;/a&gt;. How will the speeds match up once coverage is available more evenly? It could take a long time before we find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYvCx6"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s post also clearly explains its plan to lump together mmWave and C-band under 5G Plus, and it doesn’t appear that it’s giving you a way to distinguish between the two bands. T-Mobile operates similarly, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675255/tmobile-5g-uc-icon-iphone"&gt;it displays a “5G UC” icon&lt;/a&gt; when you’re connected to either its mid-band or high-band spectrums, while Verizon collectively calls the connections 5G UW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6BWd7"&gt;All this relabeling by mobile carriers isn’t making the transition to 5G any less confusing. With each service introducing its own nicknames for their fastest 5G speeds and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T mislabeling its old 4G service as “5Ge,”&lt;/a&gt;  the 5G mess becomes less and less appealing by the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg94zu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:25 PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated headline and text clarifying that AT&amp;amp;T is continuing its existing 5G strategy as planned with the C-band rollout starting in December, and how that compares with T-Mobile’s existing coverage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 695 is a faster mid-tier 5G chip </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1B47So8WeprgfbhVA4f5tvv-msE=/429x0:7179x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047174/QRD_4_pack_version_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0YuLPV"&gt;Qualcomm is announcing a pile of new Snapdragon chips today across its mid- and entry-level product lineups: the Snapdragon 778 Plus, 695, 680, and 480 Plus, offering more options to device manufacturers when it comes to picking the best processor for a phone — and, in theory, more choice for customers when they’re looking to buy one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmwdyA"&gt;The most notable new chip is the Snapdragon 695, which replaces the Snapdragon 690 in Qualcomm’s lineup. Unlike the old model, the Snapdragon 695 will support both mmWave and sub-6GHz versions of 5G, which should help improve data speeds even on cheaper phones (which have thus far tended to skip out on offering mmWave support). There’s also a  considerable boost in performance: Qualcomm promises a 15-percent improvement in CPU performance and up to 30 percent faster graphics rendering compared to the 690. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aHBHoZ-Yq7XABrPd_RkEMPbGILs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956497/QRD_4_pack_version_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kQ7CQr"&gt;There’s also the curious addition of the Snapdragon 680 — a new LTE-only SoC that’s built on the same, more modern 6nm process as the 695. It’s not quite up to par with the new 5G chip that Qualcomm announced, but rather is intended to help fill the gap in Qualcomm’s lineup for companies that still are looking for 4G-only devices (which can help cut costs in regions that don’t have 5G deployments yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JBVQM"&gt;The other two chips are refreshed versions of existing modes. There’s the Snapdragon 778G Plus, an enhanced version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442830/qualcomm-snapdragon-778g-5g-m-2-reference-design"&gt;standard 778G model&lt;/a&gt; that the company announced earlier this year, and the Snapdragon 480 Plus, which upgrades the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;existing Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;. Both models promise boosted performance compared to their non-plus counterparts, although the gains are small. The 778G Plus, for example, sees its CPU go from 2.4GHz to 2.5GHz, while 480 Plus boosts clock speed from 2.0GHz to 2.2GHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1hK5k"&gt;The four new chip platforms are all expected to launch later in Q4 2021, with partners HMD, Honor, Motorola, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi all expressing interest in using at least some of the new Snapdragon chips. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s broadband satellite venture Kuiper teams up with Verizon to expand 5G coverage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nI9_f7W1gIiuszqwr1G_yVa-y50=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046195/51595784865_fc7b54d339_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Atlas V launching at night. Project Kuiper has bought nine launches of Atlas V rockets to send its satellites into orbit.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: United Launch Alliance&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SdhCxK"&gt;Amazon’s ambitious satellite venture, called Kuiper, is teaming up with Verizon to further expand 4G / LTE and 5G coverage to remote areas of the globe. Through the new partnership, Kuiper’s future satellites could provide connectivity to future Verizon cell towers that don’t require as much costly infrastructure to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFxU7e"&gt;Kuiper is Amazon’s $10 billion initiative to launch a constellation of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit to provide broadband internet coverage to the Earth below. With satellites flying at altitudes between 366 miles and 391 miles high (or 590 kilometers and 630 kilometers up), the plan is to provide connectivity to remote and rural areas, where it is difficult to provide internet coverage through traditional fiber. During prototype testing, Kuiper claims its system can produce throughput speeds of up to 400Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tVJcKL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“no single company will close the digital divide on its own.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D700Wm"&gt;Amazon is partnering with Verizon to use Kuiper for satellite-based cellular backhaul, allowing (in theory) for Verizon to expand access to its 4G and 5G networks to more rural and remote locations without having to employ more traditional connectivity methods. Instead, Verizon would be able to build 4G and 5G towers in rural and hard-to-reach areas without digging trenches to lay fiber cables — something that is both difficult and sometimes cost-prohibitive. By removing that aspect, the deal could expand Verizon’s reach in areas that suffer from low cellular connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76rA4F"&gt;“There are billions of people without reliable broadband access, and no single company will close the digital divide on its own,” Andy Jassy, Amazon’s CEO, said in a statement. “Verizon is a leader in wireless technology and infrastructure, and we’re proud to be working together to explore bringing fast, reliable broadband to the customers and communities who need it most.” Kuiper declined to say how much Verizon is paying for this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bvmbv"&gt;Such a reality is still quite a ways off, though. Amazon’s Kuiper has yet to launch any satellites. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;As part of its launch license with the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt;, Kuiper must launch at least half of all of its satellites, or 1,618 spacecraft, by 2026. In April, Kuiper announced that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391508/amazon-ula-rocket-launches-internet-satellites-kuiper"&gt;purchased nine launches of the United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket&lt;/a&gt; to send its first batch of satellites to orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khOguD"&gt;Kuiper’s a proposed competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink project, which aims to provide the same kind of coverage, except with roughly 12,000 satellites instead. So far, SpaceX has launched more than 1,700 Starlink satellites into orbit around Earth and has even allowed users to test out individual connectivity through a beta program. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that Starlink would phase out of beta in October, but there has not been an official update on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4TIEH"&gt;Both Starlink and Kuiper rely on individual customers buying personal dish antennas in order to get connectivity from the satellites orbiting above them. Last year, Kuiper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;revealed the design of its 12-inch-wide dish&lt;/a&gt;, which is roughly half the size of Starlink’s dish (though SpaceX recently &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/new-starlink-user-dish-with-smaller-antenna-pops-up-in-fcc-filing/"&gt;requested a new license&lt;/a&gt; from the FCC for a smaller next-generation antenna).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FAEks"&gt;Starlink and Kuiper aren’t the only companies hoping to provide broadband internet access with low-flying satellites. Another company, &lt;a href="https://oneweb.net/media-center/oneweb-confirms-successful-launch-of-36-satellites-from-vostochny"&gt;OneWeb, has already launched 358 satellites&lt;/a&gt; of a proposed 648-satellite constellation. Meanwhile, another smaller company, Telesat, also plans to launch a constellation of nearly 300 satellites. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Xperia Pro-I is a camera first, 5G phone second</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHDzWh8aFvVwlO4-nGrsyIPPyl0=/0x0:750x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70045819/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_01_fe5962e1c05b0527fc2f64dea00191f8_1.png.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFMkgo"&gt;Sony is ready to throw-down with a new camera-first 5G phone — the Xperia Pro-I — in the battle for smartphone camera supremacy. Less than 12-hours after the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s reviews started dropping online, and all the camera enthusiasts trying to determine whether the Pixel 6 Pro or the iPhone 13 Pro Max has the best smartphone camera, Sony wants to be in the mix with the Xperia Pro-I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uk3hDL"&gt;The “I” in the Xperia Pro-I stands for imaging, which pays homage to Sony’s popular line of Alpha mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras and professional video cameras, rather than point-and-shoot camera model names like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995864/sony-rx100-mark-vii-camera-review-price-specs-features-microphone-jack"&gt;Sony RX100 VII (Mark 7)&lt;/a&gt;. At least that’s what the Sony representatives who were briefing journalists ahead of this event told us. The star of the show is obviously this device’s camera technology, so it’s totally fair to think of the Xperia Pro-I as a camera that happens to come with a phone attached. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jdm2oODa5ywRnuN5kYNCOXv_OA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956098/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_03_bf3834489e39e3e3a97099d54615d806.png.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia Pro-I’s triple rear camera array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jMGXWd"&gt;After all, it’s notable for using a similar 1.0-type Exmor RS image sensor with phase detection AF (autofocus) that powers the RX100 VII, the preferred point-and-shooter of vloggers and tourists. This large 1-inch camera sensor enables “outstanding low light performance, high dynamic range, and beautiful bokeh,” according to Sony. However, &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/1641689739/sony-just-packed-a-1-stacked-cmos-sensor-into-the-xperia-pro-i-but-there-s-a-catch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DPReview&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that while this 1-inch sensor is 20 megapixels in total, the Xperia Pro-I only makes use of part of the sensor, meaning it outputs a 12-megapixel image on this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nWc1Y"&gt;While rare, Sony isn’t the first to include a 1-inch sensor in a phone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp’s Aquos R6&lt;/a&gt; had one when it was announced earlier this year, as did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone"&gt;Panasonic’s CM1 from 2014&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOSN6M"&gt;Sony’s Xperia Pro-I has a total of three 12-megapixel cameras on the back (a main, ultrawide, and telephoto) and one 8-megapixel camera around its front. While these cameras seem low-resolution, the Sony representative was very eager to explain that they contain fewer but larger (2.4µm) pixels, where each pixel captures more details, more dynamic range and greater depth of field. The company seems confident it doesn’t need to chase higher megapixel counts like its rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTrH0u"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I’s rear cameras use three glass lenses from Zeiss. Its main 24mm lens has dual aperture (f2.0/f4.4) that allows you to change the depth of field more quickly to create “authentic bokeh,” rather than the digital software-created bokeh effect that other phones produce. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN8CVaZDvtYb372NgLNAF0sld_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956097/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_01_fe5962e1c05b0527fc2f64dea00191f8_1.png.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s display has a 21:9 aspect ratio, making this a narrow, tall device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="coBHFC"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I includes the same BIONZ X imaging processor found in Sony’s A9 professional mirrorless camera for sports, which allows it to take up to 20fps in burst shots similar to Sony’s recent smartphones like the Xperia 1 III. This is the rare smartphone camera that is fast at autofocus, and capable of real-time eye tracking (humans and animals) in both stills and videos. Speaking of videos, Sony claims that the Xperia Pro-I is is the first smartphone in the world that can record 4K videos at 120fps and be able to preserve all 120 frames. While other smartphones can record 4K videos, they often compress the frames into a smaller file, which means you won’t have as much control in post-production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZsaSi"&gt;On the phone side of the Xperia Pro-I, it has a 6.5-inch 21:9 3840x1644 OLED display, with 120Hz refresh rate, at a relatively skinny 21:9 aspect ratio. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G processor, and unlocked models should work on most 4G networks in the world, as well as sub-6GHz 5G. There’s 12GB RAM, 512GB of internal storage, a microSDXC card slot, and a 4,500mAh battery which can be fast-charged at 30W. Despite its premium and modern specs, the Xperia Pro-I still has a 3.5mm audio jack for creators who need to plug in a mic, and a strap hole to slide in a wrist strap for security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxwYGX"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I will ship in December 2021 for a whopping $1,800 (£1,599). That’s the same price as Samsung’s flagship foldable, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;, and $200 more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673600/iphone-13-1-tera-storage-memory-price-apple"&gt;1TB model of Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $1,599. It’s also more than a Sony’s $1,300 RX 100 VII, and the same price as the $1,800 full-frame Sony A7C. But Sony’s aim with the Xperia Pro-I is to provide a device that can do it all, combining the quality of a dedicated point-and-shoot camera with a thin (0.35-inch) 5G phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpuHTb"&gt;Preorders for the Sony Xperia Pro-I will begin October 28, 2021 at 10:00AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q320W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap on Anker MagGo accessories for MagSafe wireless charging in your car and home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tmaNmAiCZjyJE0xIQ7sURNVG_v4=/288x0:1712x949/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044128/MagGo_Family.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker is introducing MagGo, its lineup of six MagSafe-compatible products for iPhones.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tOdnom"&gt;Bored by the few Apple-certified MagSafe accessories like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674261/apple-iphone-leather-wallet-magsafe-find-my-tracking"&gt;MagSafe wallet (2021)&lt;/a&gt;, or the MagSafe Duo Charger, and feel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728967/apple-magsafe-duo-wallet-cases-charging"&gt;stifled by its small ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;? If you want to expand your MagSafe-compatible collection, you’ll need to look to third-party accessory makers like Anker for some fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A07Zx0"&gt;Anker, known for its affordable charging products like portable batteries and universal plugs, is introducing its own suite of MagSafe-compatible gadgets called MagGo that go beyond just wirelessly charging your iPhone 12 or 13. Its opening lineup has six new gadgets that take advantage of the convenience and security of attaching to the phone by magnets — these products are ideal for when you’re on the move and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMmS55"&gt;Because Apple is so reluctant to certify third-party accessories and share its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;secret sauce on how to enable 15W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, none of these Anker MagGo products will be capable of fast charging the way Apple’s official MagSafe Battery Pack can. Most are available in iPhone 13 colors (Misty Blue, Interstellar Gray, Dolomite White, and Lilac Purple) and are on sale on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/355BCB41-69A1-4EC7-BF77-DCB62DD95BAE?ingress=2&amp;amp;visitId=42d1b9d2-6b48-4c12-8c52-ab68282c3cf7&amp;amp;ref_=ast_bln"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fpages%2Fmaggo-boa&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt; today (except for the Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger 633). Just beware of the very similar product names — go by the product numbers instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZyJ6TqB-G3eDxFGnk36nZrVo_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954932/A25A00V1_RC01_V1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker MagGo Magnetic Phone Grip is a MagSafe version of the Pop Socket, but designed for iPhone 12s and 13s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IlKb8t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Phone Grip (610)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGd1kR"&gt;Like the popular pop sockets that you can attach to the back of your smartphone to get a better grip on the device, the Anker Magnetic Phone Grip (610) attaches to your iPhone using the MagSafe magnet. Anker claims it is “strong enough to hold up to 28oz (800g) or the equivalent weight of four iPhone 12s,” so you should not fear that you’ll drop your phone by holding onto the Phone Grip’s ring. This Phone Grip is available for $15.99 starting today on Anker.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQjCRc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger for your car (613)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNHSCx"&gt;Whether you need your phone for directions or your rideshare side hustle, you want to keep your phone in a safe and convenient place while driving in your car. Anker’s Magnetic Wireless Charger (613) is not only a minimalist car phone holder that attaches to your iPhone with the MagSafe magnet; it also wirelessly charges your phone while you drive (just 7.5W) and is adjustable up to 134 degrees to give you the best viewing angle. Just in case you need some extra USB ports in your car, the base that attaches to your dashboard also includes a dual-port USB charger: one USB-A and one 20W USB-C port. This handy car accessory retails for $69.99 starting today on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fb2930&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnVc8ag132XFdxtcWJrpAXOUEJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954957/violet_4_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anker MagGo Magnetic Battery has a foldable kickstand for convenient video watching.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ndqarr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Battery (622) with built-in stand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGWSkU"&gt;Of course, Anker has to make a MagSafe-friendly Magnetic Battery Pack (622) but with a twist. This one has a foldable kickstand that you can open to prop up your iPhone 12 or 13 while you watch a movie vertically or horizontally. Like Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack, this Anker battery attaches to the back of your iPhone but offers a much bigger 5,000mAh battery charging at a maximum of 7.5W, compared to a 1,460mAh battery charging at 15W on the Apple one. There is no getting around the fact that attaching such a big battery on the back of the phone adds 0.5 inches to its overall thickness, but you do get two extra USB-C ports in case you need to charge other devices when traveling. This 622 Magnetic Battery comes in complimentary iPhone colors (Misty Blue, Interstellar Gray, Dolomite White, Lilac Purple, Buds Green) and retails for $69.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1611&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVVTis9qkMB67ZAW3ABBxf_8_IY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954810/All_Colors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker’s MagGo Magnetic Wireless Charger (623) is a colorful and adjustable MagSafe-friendly stand and charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6mxxuT"&gt;Anker is also rolling out some handy home products that take advantage of MagSafe-friendly products for your home, like a charger and stand, as well as a power hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbP2eS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger (623)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ev6Dm3"&gt;Now that you are doing more video calls, you’d probably appreciate not having to hold your phone for a 4-hour Zoom meeting. This little (2.49 × 2.49 × 3.14 inches) Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger (623) may look like a little desk garbage can or speaker, but it’s actually a phone charging station for your desk. It can both hold and wirelessly charge your iPhone using the MagSafe magnet and can swivel up to 60 degrees to give you the best viewing angle. According to the press release, apparently, there is a second 5W wireless charging platform underneath the main round charging platform, where you can wirelessly charge your AirPods. It comes in all the iPhone 13-matching colors and is available now for $79.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FAnker.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-Charging/dp/B09B3FR23F?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mp98Ne"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnet Wireless Charger (633)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ok47zz"&gt;Not to be confused with the tiny speaker-like wireless charger (623), this Magnet Wireless Charger (633) is a two-fer that combines a magnetic battery and charging stand, all in one package. Like the Anker Magnetic Battery (622), this bundle comes with a 5,000mAh portable battery capable of charging at 7.5W, along with 2 USB-C ports that you can plug in two other devices that also need more juice. Once at your desk, you can then dock your iPhone without detaching the battery pack, so you can take a video call while wirelessly charging your phone. Its base even has an additional USB-C port and is a secondary 5W charging surface for your AirPods. Unlike the other MagGo products, this particular one won’t be available until December and will retail for $119.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa25a7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker MagGo Magnet Charging Station looks like a desktop speaker but it’s really a charging hub for all your gadgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C9gQEg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnet Charging Station (637)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65uu3W"&gt;Round and colorful, you’d never guess that this is actually an 8-in-1 power hub for your desk. Not only is the round surface in front a MagSafe charging platform and holder for your iPhone, but the back is also packed full of plugs for all your gadget needs. You can even simultaneously charge eight devices at once if you must. There are 2 USB-C ports, 2 USB-A ports, and three AC outlets that can charge a large laptop at full speed. Available only in America starting today, October 25th, 2021, for $99.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FAnker.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Charging-Wireless-Delivery/dp/B099W4CTJ5?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile delays shutdown of Sprint 3G network</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1b-3gOt-1pUqjPvo4j7dC_X3UE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035219/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile has delayed its plans to shut down Sprint’s CDMA network | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kyB0TN"&gt;T-Mobile said it will delay its planned shutdown of Sprint’s 3G network by three months to ensure its “partners” have time to help customers with the transition. It had originally planned to phase out the network in January; that date has now been pushed to March 31st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Kh5mD"&gt;“Recently it’s become increasingly clear that some of those partners haven’t followed through on their responsibility to help their customers through this shift,” the company said in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Fupdate-on-our-cdma-network-transition-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22741762%2Ftmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “So, we’re stepping up on their behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRagtl"&gt;T-Mobile’s statement doesn’t mention it by name, but likely is referring to Dish Network. The two sides have tangled over T-Mobile’s announcement it was shutting down Sprint’s legacy network, because of the impact it would have on Dish’s Boost Mobile customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSrfgT"&gt;As one of the conditions of the T-Mobile/Sprint Merger, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;Dish acquired Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in July, 2020 with the goal of Dish taking Sprint’s place as a fourth wireless carrier in the US. After T-Mobile announced it planned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;shut down Sprint’s CDMA network&lt;/a&gt;, Dish chairman Charlie Ergen compared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;T-Mobile to the Grinch&lt;/a&gt;, and later said his company was making every effort to migrate its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsLa4p"&gt;But T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ffor-t-mobile-5g-connectivity-means-that-no-one-is-left-behind&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22741762%2Ftmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that Dish was “dragging their feet in getting their customers upgraded to the superior 4G/5G world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGLj9w"&gt;Dish fired back on Monday; Jeff Blum, the company’s executive VP of external and legislative affairs said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that T-Mobile’s announcement “is a recognition that its premature shutdown of the CDMA network will harm consumers who rely on this network for critical connectivity, including 911.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAEr4d"&gt;Blum said that the additional time was “not nearly sufficient” to ensure that “over one million Boost customers— many of whom are low-income — projected to still need access to this network beyond March 31, 2022.” Supply chain cellphone shortages and COVID-related interruptions have slowed the upgrades, he added&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZrdWJ"&gt;“Given T-Mobile’s new admission that continuing the operation of its CDMA network will have ‘no material financial impact’ to its business and 5G buildout, we urge the company to live up to its promises to regulators,” Blum said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99YHwf"&gt;The Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618472/doj-letter-dish-t-mobile-3g-cdma-network-shutdown"&gt;Justice told Dish Network and T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in a July &lt;a href="https://dish.gcs-web.com/static-files/d0097e8d-56b9-486a-bc0a-1190e7141481"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; that it had “grave concerns” about the shutdown of Sprint’s legacy network, and urged both sides to take “all appropriate steps” to reduce the impact on customers who still rely on the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6gjLQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: October 25th 1:46PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from Dish Network EVP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
