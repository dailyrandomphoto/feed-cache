    <title>Tinder makes it easier to see if you vibe with someone’s Spotify taste</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E63rjMA6pnz0LDvBELqwbAAUzC4=/0x36:1480x1023/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249195/Music_Mode.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iNAMeE"&gt;Tinder is expanding the ways you can judge a potential match by their musical tastes by introducing a Music Mode, which lets you actually hear the song someone’s set as their “Anthem” before you choose which direction to swipe. Music Mode will integrate with Spotify, like Tinder’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/20/12948514/tinder-spotify-integration-show-top-tracks-anthem"&gt;other music features&lt;/a&gt;, but should make it easier to judge someone by the song they’ve picked to represent themselves — even if you’ve never heard it before, you’ll immediately be able to tell the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiENCC"&gt;Music Mode will live in the app’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/tinder-adds-a-new-home-for-interactive-social-features-with-launch-of-tinder-explore/"&gt;recently added Explore tab&lt;/a&gt;, which means you can ignore it if you don’t feel like listening to people’s jams right now. Tinder’s product VP Kyle Miller likened Music Mode to “that feeling when you’re at a party and you find out someone else loves the same songs you do.” Something I’ve heard is great but have never gotten to experience thanks to the fact that I exclusively listen to hyperpop shoegaze.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBstC9Sbnc8LtabSrK3jUxp7ZNg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073878/Music_Mode___Sizzle_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music Mode will let you hear a potential match’s Anthem as you swipe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PG5WbP"&gt;It’s nice to see Tinder finally building on its Anthem feature, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/20/12948514/tinder-spotify-integration-show-top-tracks-anthem"&gt;it introduced in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and lets you pick a song to feature on your profile and define yourself with. With that said, it’d be nice if the app also integrated with Apple Music — you &lt;a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003358686-I-don-t-have-a-Spotify-account-Can-I-still-add-music-to-my-profile-"&gt;can choose an Anthem without linking a Spotify account&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t be able to have your top artists automatically added to your profile like Spotify users can. (Us Apple Music users are already used to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcNo07Xp8aQ"&gt;dancing on our own&lt;/a&gt;, being left out of things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812079/apple-music-year-in-review-spotify-wrapped-social-media"&gt;like the Spotify Wrapped hype&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XPak3"&gt;The dating app also released some statistics on what music people were setting as their Anthems for 2021 — topping it is Drake’s “Way 2 Sexy (with Future &amp;amp; Young Thug),” followed by Doja Cat and SZA’s “Kiss Me More” and Olivia Rodrigo’s “good 4 u.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpDw58"&gt;Personally, I feel like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5mtclwloEQ"&gt;the original “I’m Too Sexy”&lt;/a&gt; would be much more attention-grabbing than Drake’s spin on it, but you do you. Hopefully, though, Tinder will be able to do some sort of sorting for Music Mode so you don’t end up hearing the same song over and over if everyone is using it as their Anthem. The company says Music Mode should become available everywhere you can get Spotify in the coming weeks, and that you’ll be able to use it if you’ve &lt;a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003357846-Connecting-Spotify-to-your-Tinder-profile"&gt;linked your Spotify account&lt;/a&gt; and added an Anthem of your own. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo teases its first foldable, the Find N</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/210HuY0HIuuHi38kluFnSvr6ByA=/0x0:1446x964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248508/ezgif.com_gif_maker__7_.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A short teaser trailer shows the folding mechanism in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Oppo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWmyrz"&gt;Oppo has announced its first foldable smartphone, the Oppo Find N, in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oppo.com%2Fen%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress%2Foppo-inno-day-2021-pete-letter-findn%2F%3Fs%3D09&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22825716%2Foppo-find-n-foldable-inno-day-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; penned by its chief product officer (and OnePlus CEO) Pete Lau. The device will be launched next week on December 15th, on the second day of Oppo’s annual Inno Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmzUEx"&gt;Although the post doesn’t reveal too many specifics about the device, a teaser trailer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468777421243490312"&gt;released on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; shows it has a similar form factor to Samsung’s Z Fold devices, combining a large internal folding screen with a smaller outer screen that can be used like a traditional smartphone. Interestingly, this small outer screen looks like it has a similar aspect ratio to a traditional smartphone, unlike the tall thin external display of the Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2broZE"&gt;In his post, Lau admits that other companies have beaten Oppo to commercializing foldable smartphones. But he claims that these competing devices haven’t had the “utility, durability, and user experience” to make them feasible purchases for most people. “For Oppo, it is better to launch a product at a later date when it is ready to offer a great user experience instead of simply rushing to keep up with trends,” Lau writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CbZPyd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the exquisitely engineered &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOFindN?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOFindN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Hold. Fold. Enjoy. Repeat.&lt;br&gt;Coming December 15. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOINNODAY2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOINNODAY2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LVZKNgYiAv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LVZKNgYiAv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468777421243490312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOBTso"&gt;The Find N is said to be the result of four years of R&amp;amp;D and six generations of prototypes, with Lau noting that the first generation of the Find N dates back to April 2018. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/25/18239353/oppo-foldable-phone-prototype-huawei-mate-x"&gt;February 2019 the company showed off&lt;/a&gt; one of its foldable prototypes, although this version had a single large display that wrapped around the outside of the device, as opposed to the Find N’s internal folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hi8grN"&gt;Lau says the aim was to make a device with a beautiful design that feels good in the hand, while also being useful and easy to use. “For a foldable smartphone, both the closed-screen and open-screen experience should be equally simple to use,” Lau writes. “Then on top of that, we should create a groundbreaking efficient experience that a traditional smartphone cannot provide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hDUC3"&gt;Oppo plans to launch the Find N on the second day of its annual Inno Day event, where it typically shows off concept technologies and products. In previous years, Oppo has used these events to announce concept technologies like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;rollable phone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536363/oppo-x-2021-rollable-smartphone-demonstration-features"&gt;Oppo X 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as well as AR glasses, neither of which have made it to market. As well as the Find N, Oppo has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823689/oppo-retractable-phone-camera-teaser-inno-day-2021"&gt;teased a device with a retractable rear camera&lt;/a&gt; for this year’s Inno Day, as well as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468475432601370626"&gt;more augmented reality glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktfd81"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Hyatt begin rolling out hotel keys in Apple Wallet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aZJlWeDJdvLeptcVsB_PQp7yiNY=/0x0:5100x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70245866/apple_hyatt_hotel_keys.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Using a hotel key stored in Apple Wallet | Photo by Hyatt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="schzpU"&gt;Apple is partnering with Hyatt to give some hotel guests the ability to store their room keys in their Apple Wallets, as announced in a post on &lt;a href="https://newsroom.hyatt.com/news-releases?item=124174#assets_all"&gt;Hyatt’s newsroom&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of checking your pockets for your room key, you’ll now be able to use your iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock your room, as well as any other areas around the hotel that require a key for entry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jkVOqsVC9lD_s-1TszF6Tr5FLyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073568/hyatt_apple_watch_unlock.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Hyatt&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Apple Watch can unlock your hotel room at participating Hyatt hotels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zUQSog"&gt;There are currently only six Hyatt hotels in the US that support this feature, although Hyatt says it plans to eventually include it in hotels worldwide. But for now, the participating hotels include: Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, Hyatt Centric Key West Resort and Spa, Hyatt House Chicago / West Loop-Fulton Market, Hyatt House Dallas / Richardson, Hyatt Place Fremont / Silicon Valley, and Hyatt Regency Long Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5faq1"&gt;Just keep in mind that in order to use the feature, your iPhone will need iOS 15 or above, and your Apple Watch must run watchOS 8 and above. Hyatt notes that once you’ve completed your reservation, you can add your room key to your Apple Wallet through the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/world-of-hyatt/id476639005"&gt;World of Hyatt&lt;/a&gt; app. The key will display your room number and will only activate when your room is ready for check-in. If you need to make any changes to your room, you can do so through the app, and your key will be updated automatically. Your key will deactivate once you’ve checked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kpfb4U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Apple previewed this feature&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC 2021 alongside its digital ID feature. Once launched, this will allow users in participating states to digitally store their identification cards in their Apple Wallets. Although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652051/apple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15"&gt;Arizona and Georgia&lt;/a&gt; were supposed to be the first states to let residents store their IDs on their iPhones, its rollout &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799338/apple-digital-driver-license-delay-2022-ios-15"&gt;has been delayed until 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo teases retractable rear camera for phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LTrYZpknmIRBlb2ESvWB1D_RGaE=/0x0:1119x746/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243251/Screenshot_2021_12_08_at_16.19.32.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjsbeB"&gt;Oppo has released a brief video hinting at a new type of camera design for smartphones. The company’s “self-developed retractable camera” is shown extending from the phone’s body before retracting back inside. The video suggests that the mechanism is waterproof and that it’ll automatically retract the camera if the phone is dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6UIgo"&gt;Unlike pop-up selfie cameras that hide themselves inside a phone until needed, moving the camera back and forth on the Z-axis could have implications for image quality, though Oppo hasn’t yet claimed anything about any optical advantages of this design. It doesn’t appear to be a zoom lens, given it’s marked simply as 50mm, but it could theoretically help improve telephoto performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B6GnXn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Most pop-ups are annoying... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not our self-developed retractable camera!   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explore more in INNO WORLD on 14/12.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOINNODAY2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOINNODAY2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/33hgJSw8If"&gt;pic.twitter.com/33hgJSw8If&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468143243183468556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlj0TN"&gt;The markings on the camera module show that the sensor is 1/1.56 inches and the lens is 50mm-equivalent with an f/2.4 aperture, meaning it should be around 2x longer than the phone’s main lens. That’s a much bigger sensor than you tend to find behind telephoto lenses, so maybe the extra height allowed by the retracting mechanism is what makes this possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TwZRR"&gt;Oppo is releasing this video ahead of next week’s annual Inno Day event, where the company often shows off various concepts and technologies before they’re commercially deployed. Last year’s event featured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;a rollable phone and AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Oppo is holding Inno Day across two days, December 14th and 15th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5G now means some flights won’t be able to land when pilots can’t see the runway</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TELECOMMUNICATION-5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P2SmjVL7gqjAmGsnakw9rhoCE4s=/0x0:3890x2593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241822/1187777089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by GEORGE FREY/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Je3AF2"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are hoping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;new swaths of C-band cellular radio spectrum&lt;/a&gt; will help make the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"&gt;5G hype&lt;/a&gt; closer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;to reality&lt;/a&gt;, but the big mid-band 5G rollout may have a side effect. Airplanes rely on radio altimeters to tell how high they are above the ground to safely land when pilots can’t see, and the FAA is now instructing 6,834 of them to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;do that &lt;/em&gt;at certain airports because of 5G interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wk7L8d"&gt;The FAA ruled on Tuesday that those thousands of US planes (and some helicopters) won’t be able to use many of the guided and automatic landing systems that are designed to work in poor visibility conditions, if they’re landing at an airport where there’s deemed to be enough interference that their altimeters aren’t reliable. “Landings during periods of low visibility could be limited due to concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place,” FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BIp4pP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These limitations could prevent dispatch of flights ... and could also result in flight diversions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ry5ywH"&gt;That likely means flight delays: “These limitations could prevent dispatch of flights to certain locations with low visibility, and could also result in flight diversions,” reads a portion &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statement-5g"&gt;of the FAA’s written explanation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThSiaf"&gt;“We are engaged with the wireless operators, as well as our interagency partners, to do everything possible to make sure the mitigations are tailored to prevent disruptions,” Lunsford tells us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOc6AS"&gt;The FAA ruling does give airlines and pilots an out — if they can prove their airplanes have altimeters that are protected or are otherwise not going to be affected by interference. No airline would comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on expected delays, nor would the Airlines for America industry group that the airlines pointed us to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrVvSn"&gt;It’s not yet clear which specific airports might restrict low visibility flight, but you can imagine that they’d likely be in the same places where the carriers are deploying mid-band 5G — with a few exceptions, they’re the United States’ most-populated cities. As of December, &lt;a href="https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgSAIB.nsf/dc7bd4f27e5f107486257221005f069d/27ffcbb45e6157e9862587810044ad19/%24FILE/AIR-21-18.pdf"&gt;the planned rollouts (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; are in 46 markets designated as Partial Economic Areas (PEAs), including 1-4, 6-10, 12- 19, 21-41, and 43-50. (You can see a full list of PEAs &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-14-759A2.pdf"&gt;here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.) The FAA plans to issue notices for specific airports later.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FphoGu"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T did agree to push back the launch of C-band by one month (to January 2022), and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801008/verizon-att-midband-5g-c-band-lower-power-six-months"&gt;offered to dial back the power of 5G towers for six months&lt;/a&gt; past that to address concerns. Carriers and their lobbying group, the CTIA, have suggested that there isn’t a valid reason to fear interference, but the FAA has so far not been convinced. Nor was an aviation lobbying group, the Aerospace Industries Association, which sent a letter to the FCC on Monday suggesting that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s proposed power limits don’t go far enough for safety. The FCC, not the FAA, is the entity that regulates wireless interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUyLUY"&gt;While C-band 5G and these radio altimeters don’t actually operate in the same band, the bands are close enough that the fear exists. One possible solution is a band filter for those altimeters, but organizations like the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) &lt;a href="https://www.rtca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Webinar-QA-11.30.20-1.pdf"&gt;have warned (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; that it might take years to certify them and retrofit all the planes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s voice plan likely to launch with iOS 15.2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GNM4mGiERzIJaVPPRhhEgO1jao=/49x0:1669x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240840/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_10.44.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Music’s new voice plan will cost $4.99 per month.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gzo4X7"&gt;Apple seems to be close to rolling out the Apple Music Voice Plan, a more affordable tier of Apple Music that lets you access music using only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;your voice and the company’s Siri assistant&lt;/a&gt;. The new plan appeared in the update notes for the iOS 15.2 release candidate, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1468280991244603393"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Federico Viticci&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests it will be available widely sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wtLfUq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's iOS 15.2 RC time! Apple also confirmed Apple Music Voice Plan will launch with iOS 15.2 &lt;a href="https://t.co/6uHeaTdr41"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6uHeaTdr41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1468280991244603393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qzljln"&gt;Apple first announced the Voice Plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max"&gt;at its October event&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time, said the new tier would be available in seventeen countries and regions “later this fall.” It will cost $4.99 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mxe72n"&gt;Other iOS 15.2 betas have included a few new features that will likely also be included in the final release. One is the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;set a Legacy Contact&lt;/a&gt; who can access your iCloud data when you die. Another is the Communication Safety feature that blurs nude images &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;for children using the Messages app&lt;/a&gt;, though unlike the version announced earlier this year, parents will not be able to be notified if a child views an image. iPhone 13 Pro users will be able to press a button &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;to turn macro mode on or off&lt;/a&gt;. And promised changes to make iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements easier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786274/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes"&gt;have appeared in iOS 15.2 betas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhaLar"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment about the release date for iOS 15.2 or the Apple Music Voice Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3avx8K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone is now available on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Springboard" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwiEZ119sIizjxW6rSlE1xcoWew=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239202/Springboard_Thumb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znkkjV"&gt;In 1998, Donna Dubinsky and Jeff Hawkins quit Palm, a company they’d founded, to begin a new one: Handspring. They had a simple goal in mind: to eventually create the smartphone. Years before any of the technology was actually ready, their tiny startup began laying the necessary groundwork for what would become the Treo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zuyx7m"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;, we document the history of Handspring, from its dramatic beginnings to its tragic end. Along the way, we hear from five of the key players who tried to invent the modern smartphone years before the technology world was ready for it. It’s a story that interweaves the dotcom crash, technological innovations, wireless carrier resistance, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i267F"&gt;You can watch &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s smart TV apps on Roku, Fire TV, Android TV, and Apple TV. And now it’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9_Vh9h3Ohw"&gt;also available on our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RY6PV4"&gt;Alongside today’s YouTube release, we’re also publishing a special episode of The Vergecast, the discussion we recorded after the premiere of &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; at our 10-year anniversary party in New York last October. In it, Nilay Patel and I talk through some of the stories that were left on the cutting room floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I5v29y"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7469173203&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qPiwth"&gt;I’d like to share a couple of them here, too. Both fall outside the scope of the documentary’s timeline, which was focused strictly on Handspring and not the eras of Palm that preceded and followed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGhQfp"&gt;The first comes from Jeff Hawkins during the early days of Palm. His company had captured the lion’s share of the Personal Digital Assistant Market with the PalmPilot and some of its successors, which meant that Microsoft was going to take another run at them. Given Microsoft’s dominance, it was an existential threat. Here’s how Jeff, one of the great product executives in tech history, described his approach to handling that threat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rHHbaz"&gt;Our first big run in competition was with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_V"&gt;Palm V.&lt;/a&gt; That was with Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR3G8n"&gt;We had been having a lot of success with the PalmPilot, and Microsoft said, literally, Steve Ballmer got in front of their annual conference, and they had a picture of Palm in a target, and it was like, “We’re gonna kill these guys,” you know? “We’re gonna crush them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjhIzb"&gt;I had engineers writing their resumes. I mean there were people saying, “Oh, man, it was a good run, sorry,” you know? The conventional wisdom was you can’t compete against Microsoft, and I said, “No, we can compete.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1Kftx"&gt;And I came up with a strategy for it. I said we’re gonna build hardware and the software. They’re only building the software, and they’re relying on other people to build the hardware. So what we oughta do on our next product is create the most beautiful piece of hardware we can create, which they’re not gonna do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDTXFy"&gt;This was the controversial idea; they were adding all these features to their software, tons of features to their software. And I said, “We’re not gonna add any new features to our software,” because if we add new features to our software, people are going to compare our new software features to Microsoft’s new software features, and we’re gonna be behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jj1sPT"&gt;If we come out with a beautiful product, they won’t talk about our new software features. All they’ll do is talk about the new, beautiful product. And then they’ll say, “This product is more beautiful than anything that they got going on,” right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C85Xvs"&gt;So this was a controversial strategy of mine; we’re not going to add new features when the Palm V came out. There’s going to be &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; new software features. We could have had a whole list of things we could put in, but I said that’s not going to help us. And it worked beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRATR9"&gt;The Palm V came out, and we just crushed Microsoft. They just, you know, they just couldn’t compete at all. And they were blown away that we blew ‘em away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0Psb9f"&gt;The second story is a little different — and it’s also addressed in our Vergecast episode today, with some of the relevant audio. After Handspring merged back with Palm, Ed Colligan was running things, and eventually, all eyes were on Apple, which was widely expected to release a smartphone. A few weeks before the iPhone was first announced, Colligan sat for an interview with &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter John Markoff at the Churchill Club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJeC8k"&gt;Back in 2006, nothing had actually leaked about the iPhone, and so Markoff and Colligan speculated a bit on what Apple might be doing. Then the conversation turned to discussing competition in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EcXZR"&gt;All of this context is in service to correcting the record on one of Colligan’s responses. Somewhat famously, a line of his has been quoted over and over — most often by John Gruber at Daring Fireball in a post titled “&lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2006/11/colligan_head_stuck"&gt;Palm CEO Ed Colligan’s Head Seems to be Stuck Somewhere&lt;/a&gt;.” He quotes the following real-time transcription — which, as it turns out, is inaccurate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uoIY7U"&gt;Responding to questions from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; correspondent John Markoff at a Churchill Club breakfast gathering Thursday morning, Colligan laughed off the idea that any company — including the wildly popular Apple Computer — could easily win customers in the finicky smartphone sector.&lt;br&gt;“We’ve learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone,” he said. “PC guys are not going to just figure this out. They’re not going to just walk in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="w697Ht"&gt;We’ve gotten the original recording of the interview — our thanks to the &lt;a href="https://computerhistory.org/"&gt;Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which has received the Churchill Club’s archives after it sadly had to shut down. Here’s the actual exchange, which begins after the Apple speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Gkm2Th"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Markoff&lt;/strong&gt;: But what will it look like in 2007? Apple does get in. Eric’s [Schmidt, then CEO of Google] wandering around talking about free phones. He’s got Andy Rubin, who was the founder of Danger doing something inside. He bought Andy’s startup. The phone market could look, I mean, it looks crowded now. It could look intensely crowded next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Colligan:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s intensely big. We just have to get our fair share of the pie. And let me tell you this, it’s not as easy as it looks. You’ve seen Motorola, one of the biggest phone companies in the world enter with a device that was going to take over the world, and it’s had enormous issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff&lt;/strong&gt;: The Q? You’re talking about the Q. [The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Q"&gt;Motorola Q&lt;/a&gt;, a hyped up Windows Mobile smartphone that struggled with technical problems and slow sales]&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. And so I just would caution people that think they’re going to walk in here and just and do these. We’ve struggled for a few years here, figuring out how to make a decent phone. The PC guys are not going to just, you know, knock this out. I guarantee it. So, look, welcome, let’s go for it. We can’t stop all that. It’s going to happen, but it’s going to be, I don’t think it’ll be so easy for everybody, as everybody thinks to enter it. It’s a tough space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ve been around this industry long enough, and you probably remember, maybe you don’t actually, the famous Wall Street Journal ad that Apple took out in 1981. “&lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/37-years-ago-steve-jobs-ran-apples-most-amazing-ad-heres-story-its-almost-been-forgotten.html"&gt;Welcome IBM. Seriously&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. Well, look, you know, I’m not trying to be cocky about it. It is a tough, it’s a tough business. We’ve really struggled through that in the sense of making world class radios that perform on global networks consistently with all the applications that we deliver and…&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff: &lt;/strong&gt;Is radio expertise, something you have to have internally, is that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. That’s a black art, still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sptpOD"&gt;The conversation moves on from there. Colligan clearly saw the competition coming was was likely worried and needed to put a brave face on it, but it’s notable that the more immediate prompt was Google and Motorola. And beyond the specifics of the wording, the overall tone and affect of Colligan’s response (which you can hear about in The Vergecast episode, starting around the 11 minute mark) is also relevant. It wasn’t a prediction that Apple would fail — it was more of an admission that smartphones were hard. And it wasn’t simply about Apple, but also Google and the new entrants running Windows Mobile (which Palm also used on its Treos at the time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkm6mC"&gt;Weeks later, the iPhone was announced and it was, of course, more popular than any Treo. However, it was Android that ended up walking in, becoming the fatal competition for Palm and its subsequent webOS phones. Verizon ultimately chose Google’s operating system and the Motorola Droid instead of the Palm Pre to compete with the then-AT&amp;amp;T-exclusive iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERCB4W"&gt;The Motorola Droid was spearheaded by Rick Osterloh — who got his start making SoundsGood MP3 Springboard modules for Handspring Visors before his company was acquired by Motorola. Palm held on for a little while longer and was acquired by HP, but the Droid was the beginning of the end. Osterloh now runs hardware at Google, and his Pixel phones face competition every bit as daunting as anything Palm once dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bresf2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32Yg7O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I regret to inform you that Digital Human as a Service (DHaaS) is now an acronym </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5XUqdfynHeOCJqNEf8YQ8A6hUA8=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237636/aiko_digital_human_as_a_service.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hSi2lL"&gt;Science fiction movies have prepared us for the distinct possibility that artificial intelligence will walk among us someday. How soon? No one can say — but that isn’t stopping a raft of companies by trying to sell “digital humans” before that whole &lt;em&gt;intelligence &lt;/em&gt;thing gets figured out. Ah, but what if you don’t want to &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; a digital human because that sounds icky? Rent one, of course! That’s why we now have the regrettable acronym Digital Human as a Service (DHaaS). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFaazl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211203005441/en/KDDI-and-Mawari-to-Launch-a-Digital-Human-as-a-Service-DHaaS-Using-AWS-Wavelength/"&gt;The actual news here&lt;/a&gt; is that Japanese telecom giant KDDI has partnered with a firm named Mawari (which means something along the lines of “surroundings” in Japanese) to create a virtual assistant you can “see” through the window of your smartphone in augmented reality, one who might automatically pop up to give you directions and interact if you point your phone at a real-world location. (You’ll also see walking directions and indoor maps in the video, but those simply appear to be packaged together as part of the proof of concept.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Map68D"&gt;If you peek the video atop this post, you can see it’s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much more advanced than, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761166/pokemon-go-ar-games-future-pikmin-harry-potter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But behind the scenes, the partners claim that KDDI’s 5G network, Amazon’s low-latency AWS Wavelength edge computing nodes, and a proprietary codec from Mawari combine to let “digital humans” stream to your phone in real time instead of running natively on your phone’s chip. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F1d0_0rnC5gkPkp97ggcHl_XsXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23068620/aiko_digital_human_as_a_service.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zsrMiR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the heavy processing requirements of real-time digital humans”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MaOtMZ"&gt;That “substantially lower[s] the heavy processing requirements of real-time digital humans, reducing cost, data size and battery consumption while unlocking scalability,” according to the press release. (It’s true that AR apps like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; tend to chow down on battery, but it’s not just graphics to blame; some of that is running GPS, camera and cellular simultaneously.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvvEtZ"&gt;Who’s going to jump on board to actually populate the metaverse with experiences designed for KDDI and Mawari’s “digital humans” and pay monthly, quarterly or annually for the “service” part of the acronym? That’s always the question, but there’s no shortage of companies looking to lean into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the buzzy metaverse&lt;/a&gt; these days. And if they can leverage their existing buzzwords like “5G”, “AI” and “Edge compute,” so much the better. It takes a lot of work to look like you’re paying attention to the future, and you never know if this  is the moment someone actually manages to &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stop-trying-to-make-fetch-happen"&gt;make fetch happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zo2E1H"&gt;Quick Tap to Snap, a Google Pixel feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734993/pixel-6-snapchat-feature-tap-camera"&gt;announced in October&lt;/a&gt; that lets you open Snapchat directly from your lock screen by tapping twice on the rear of the phone, is arriving as part of the Pixel’s latest feature drop. The functionality will be available on the Pixel 4A 5G and newer devices, and Google says there’s also a new Pixel-exclusive Snapchat filter called “Pixel Face” on the way this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQ88uj"&gt;The Quick Tap to Snap feature is one of a handful of updates coming as part of the Google Pixel’s feature drop this month. Other features include new ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on the Pixel 6 Pro, a new “conversation mode” accessibility feature in the Sound Amplifier app, and the expansion of car crash detection and automatic transcriptions to more countries and languages, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3die9m"&gt;We’ve known since its launch that the Pixel 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;includes an ultra-wideband chip&lt;/a&gt;, but until now it’s not been used for much. However, with this latest update, Google says the 6 Pro’s UWB chip will be used to improve its Nearby Share feature when sending files to other ultra-wideband devices, including compatible Samsung phones. UWB chips found in Samsung and Apple’s recent phones have used the technology to accurately pinpoint their respective &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;trackers&lt;/a&gt;, but similar functionality has yet to make an appearance on Google’s latest phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sound Amplifier feature in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jKgDGX"&gt;Google is characterizing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708608/google-sound-amplifier-accessibilities-android-6-marshmallow-support-expansion-how-to"&gt;Sound Amplifier’s&lt;/a&gt; “conversation mode” as an “early-stage accessibility feature.” It’s designed to tune out distracting background noise when you’re trying to listen to someone, with an interface that’s as simple as pointing your phone at the person to whom you want to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djVGbF"&gt;A couple of previously launched features are also expanding. The Pixel’s Recorder app, which allows you to automatically transcribe speech, now supports more languages like Japanese, French, and German on the Pixel 3 and up. These languages were previously exclusive to Pixel 6 devices, according to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9516618?hl=en"&gt;Google’s support page&lt;/a&gt;. Car crash detection, which originally launched with the Pixel 4 in 2019, is also expanding to more countries. It’s coming to Taiwan, Italy, and France, after having previously been available in Spain, Ireland, Japan, the UK, Australia, Singapore, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxGiwg"&gt;There are a couple of customization tweaks coming to select Pixel devices and accessories. If you’re using a Pixel phone with the A-series Pixel Buds you now get more control over bass response, and the Pixel 3 and newer can now customize how long you need to hold the power button before the Google Assistant activates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQvRe9"&gt;Google says these features are rolling out “in the next few weeks.” The exact availability of features varies by Pixel model. They join a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811617/google-android-auto-widgets-assistant-family-bell-updates-december-2021"&gt;collection of new features&lt;/a&gt; that were announced for the Android platform more generally last week, which included the ability to unlock select 2020–2022 BMW cars in certain countries by tapping Pixel 6 phones on the door handle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea Nordmärke portable wireless charger details revealed by the FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SB3-NvcigpQ_FvfS2ecS77c3Jvw=/0x0:1619x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235102/ikea3.001.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;FCC filing of the new IKEA Nordmärke portable qi wireless power bank | Image: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MCJz2L"&gt;Ikea is starting to distribute a new wireless charging puck with a built-in battery. The discovery of this Nordmärke-branded portable charger came from a reader of German tech news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.mobiflip.de/shortnews/ikea-nordmaerke-qi-laden-akku/"&gt;mobiFlip&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-nordmarke-qi-charger-leak-203043188.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), who purchased the product from an Ikea in Cologne for €19.99 Euros ($22.57).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvIs6U"&gt;We couldn’t find any references to the new charger on Ikea’s website, however, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to locate &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-E2108"&gt;the company’s filing with the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, where the product is listed with ID FHO-E2108.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This is the Ikea wireless charging puck upside down and cut in half showing the electronics inside. Two yellow cylinders are visible which are the battery cells, covered in glue." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OklXSNa1QgE4MhrfilNDbwKD9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066152/ikeachargerbatt.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Ikea Nordmärke wireless charger cut in half, presenting nonremovable 18650 cells.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0u4NAK"&gt;The wireless charger carries the same label as Ikea’s other Qi-enabled wireless charging pads, which come in various circular and rectangular plastic bodies finished with materials such as cork and fabric. The new charger is also outfitted in gray fabric — but comes in a square shape and enough height to accommodate the batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qtRW4"&gt;The bottom of the charger mentions that the Li-ion battery’s capacity is 24Wh (6,500mAh) and uses a common 18650 cell. Based on the internal images, the charger contains two heavily adhered and soldered 18650 cells — rendering the batteries hardly user-replaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wig6di"&gt;Ikea’s new charger, much like the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%2Fproducts%2F%3Fq%3Dwireless%2520charging&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22816581%2Fikea-nordmarke-portable-wireless-qi-charger-fcc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22677980/ikea-sjomarke-wireless-qi-charging-existing-furniture"&gt;wireless chargers&lt;/a&gt;, operates at a sleepy 5W rate. According to the FCC-filed &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-E2108/Users-Manual/E2108-User-Manual-Rev1-5558655"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; for this Nordmärke charger, the device needs a 10W USB-C power supply — but you’ll have to bring your own charging source and cable. Expect to start seeing these rolled out into Ikea stores in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
