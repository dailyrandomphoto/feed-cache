    <title>Apple’s App Store is hosting multi-million dollar scams, says this iOS developer</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UakKY0"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou has a new calling that goes beyond software development: taking on what he sees as a rampant scam problem ruining the integrity of Apple’s App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7m4aTz"&gt;Eleftheriou, who created the successful Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType, has for the last two weeks been publicly criticizing Apple for lax enforcement of its App Store rules that have allowed scam apps, as well as apps that clone popular software from other developers, to run rampant. These apps enjoy top billing in the iPhone marketplace, all thanks to glowing reviews and sterling five-star ratings that are largely fabricated, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bfrJAE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Up to now, I've been in the "Apple *wants* to do the right thing" camp. My viewpoint is starting to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to spot a $5M/year scam on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;, in 5 minutes flat: &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938977748078594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zq0wOY"&gt;“It’s surprising more people don’t know about this. The extent to which this has been going on and is currently going on is absolutely mind-blowing,” Eleftheriou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;of the magnitude of fraud he says is occurring daily on the App Store&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;In particular now with the App Store, which is my main concern, the problem has grown to such an extent that having the rating and review system is making it worse. It gives consumers a false sense of security and a false idea that the app is great as you’re entering it through a glowing App Store page with raving reviews.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otnjzC"&gt;His vocal complaints, which have attracted the attention and support of countless other app developers in the iOS community, underscore the increasing tension between Apple and the software makers upon whom it depends. It comes at a time of unprecedented antitrust scrutiny and legal challenges from competitors related to the company’s stewardship of the App Store, from which it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to have made more than $64 billion last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpAAa8"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZkhTKG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The extent to which this has been going on and is currently going on is absolutely mind-blowing.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoaFRC"&gt;The issues Eleftheriou is raising are interlocking ones all stemming from what he says are inconsistently enforced App Store rules and lazy moderation. It’s not just apps that try to siphon money away from consumers under false pretenses using exploitative subscription services. It’s also fake reviews and ratings that can be bought and a broken algorithmic ranking system that helps these apps float to the top and take the spot of genuine paid apps developed by small teams or singular developers, Eleftheriou says. Letting it perpetuate, he adds, is a platform that Apple does not actively police unless it’s an issue that gains the attention of the media or involves one of Apple’s current rivals like Facebook or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEXORD"&gt;Eleftheriou first detailed his personal experience with App Store scams &lt;a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_161281136039111&amp;amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;amp;libId=kkwxug0j010023dg000DLc57hpt7i&amp;amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F02%2F08%2Fapp-store-scam-apps-how-to-spot%2F&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fkeleftheriou%2Fstatus%2F1356011069395755009&amp;amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;amp;title=Developer%20exposes%20multiple%20scam%20apps%20on%20the%20App%20Store%2C%20some%20bringing%20in%20millions%20of%20dollars%20in%20revenue%20-%209to5Mac&amp;amp;txt=thread%20began%20two%20weeks%20ago"&gt;late last month in a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, where he explained how his app FlickType was maliciously copied by numerous developers that built non-functioning versions of the software and charged egregious subscription fees, only getting away with it because of strong App Store reviews and high five-star ratings he claims are fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDyny2"&gt;Eleftheriou says his primary competitor, a scam app called KeyWatch, was charging users $8 per week and amassing more than $2 million a year, according to analytics from Appfigures, despite the app not functioning properly. He says KeyWatch even advertised its software using his promotional video — with his name still attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7onrML"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The App Store has a big problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.&lt;br&gt;Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/ &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDNC96"&gt;Eleftheriou has since embarked on an online crusade to bring more attention to the topic, fueled in part by Apple choosing to take down some of the apps he’s been highlighting but letting the developers behind those apps continue publishing to the App Store. Scores of other developers have begun chiming in with their own experiences, too, including notable Apple critics like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KZ5te"&gt;Some of these critics, including Hansson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;with regard to his company’s Hey email client&lt;/a&gt;, have accused Apple in the past of mistreating and overcharging developers using the App Store’s standard 30 percent cut of app downloads and in-app purchases. These critics see the scam situation as further proof that Apple profits off of these developers and therefore doesn’t take proper steps to moderate the platform and enforce its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kkilUu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The subscription scam apps that Apple allow in the App Store really are bananas. While they're busy hunting legitimate developers down for their pound of flesh, they're letting these hyaenas strive on the savannah unopposed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NpsjjWC0CY"&gt;https://t.co/NpsjjWC0CY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1358822574243905538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="S1tG5n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple refuses to take down two scam apps that destroy my honest business via fake ratings and false marketing claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have hard proof yet Apple ignores my numerous reports.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt;, please do something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my story.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppStore?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppStore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Appocalypse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Appocalypse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Scams?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Scams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/SCw9FHrN7g"&gt;https://t.co/SCw9FHrN7g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WatchChat (@WatchChatInfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WatchChatInfo/status/1358825883465904131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AqKXD9"&gt;Apple has yet to respond publicly to Eleftheriou’s claims, though the company has removed KeyWatch and some of the other scam apps he’s brought attention to over the past week. But the issues are systemic, Eleftheriou says, and nothing short of an overhaul to how the App Store ranks software, measures trustworthiness, and roots out bad actors will remedy the issue. Until then, Eleftheriou says he’s going to keep sounding the alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DP3h6I"&gt;“I’m not gonna stop. Whenever I see a scam, I’m going to call them out,” he says. “I just can’t wait for some actual proper change from Apple to make me feel like I should concentrate on what I should be concentrating on, which is app development.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zke3Gs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more users understand this is a problem, the more pressure there will be on Apple to act.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2FSGs"&gt;He says a competing app store on the iPhone could help solve a lot of these issues. That’s the same line of argument Epic has used in its lawsuit against Apple over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Epic and its chief executive, Tim Sweeney, have called for alternative marketplaces on iOS, as well as the ability for apps distributed through the App Store to use their own payment systems and not give Apple 30 percent of every transaction. After Epic deployed its own in-app payment system within &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last summer, Apple removed the app for violating its rules. Epic is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;suing both Apple and Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95KyD4"&gt;“In an ideal world, competition does have the tendency to sort a lot of things out, whether it’s pricing or enforcement of rules. Competition is like creativity; you get all these new ideas and hopefully the best get to the top,” Eleftheriou says. “The other way would be for developers to publicly share their stories as far and as wide as possible. The more users understand this is a problem, the more pressure there will be on Apple to act.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOAb8y"&gt;Eleftheriou adds that he’s disappointed in Apple’s silence on the matter, though that’s only energized him further to continue speaking out. “It’s not just acting. I think Apple needs to, at the minimum, say something, acknowledge the issue and that they’re working on it,” he says. “Just staying silent about it is just falsely reinforcing this notion for consumers that App Store reviews and ratings are to be trusted. They are not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYjouv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can save up to $200 on new unlocked Samsung Galaxy S21 phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IRuHbMDkV-ahn_z-KIf9gwhFxpk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68786870/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3A1wHz"&gt;Samsung’s new line of Galaxy S21 smartphones launched less than two weeks ago, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2FRMPN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DSamsungS21%26sort%3DPRICE_LOW_TO_HIGH%26filters%3Dfct_a_filter_by%253A02_REBATE%257C03_INSTOCK%252Cfct_brand_name%253Asamsung#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731727797377923180" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have already marked down the phones to their lowest prices to date, with up to $200 in savings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDm8oe"&gt;If the Galaxy S21 is the phone you’re looking for, you can grab an unlocked model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2FRMPN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for only $700&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38M7NT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $750&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a 6.2-inch 1080p screen with refresh rates of up to 120Hz and is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. My colleague, Dieter Bohn, praised the Galaxy S21 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt; for having a fast processor, nice screen, and good battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9udtJt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w4jpaN"&gt;The S21 Plus normally starts at $1,000, but you can grab an unlocked model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N387GNG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $800&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N3573HX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $850&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a 6.7-inch 1080p screen with adaptive refresh rates of up to 120Hz. The Galaxy S21 Plus also includes a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens on the back, in addition to a 10-megapixel selfie camera on the front. As my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Chaim Gartenberg points out in his hands-on&lt;/a&gt;, the S21 Plus no longer has a depth sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J5i6vc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNmk57"&gt;Lastly, Samsung’s flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S21 Ultra, is on sale starting at $1,000 if you want an unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2MSSZY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model&lt;/a&gt;, $1,050 if you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P54F6HB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;, and $1,180 if you want the highest storage configuration available for this phone, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2FS32C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L28LUW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is the only phone in the S21 line to include support for Samsung’s stylus, the S Pen, a first for the S-line of smartphones. The S21 Ultra also includes a 108-megapixel sensor. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;his review&lt;/a&gt;, Dieter praised the S21 Ultra’s battery life and camera system. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter reportedly mulls charging for TweetDeck and new advanced features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U88EYw8SYSJpWiiNc7EtryMS25E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68786799/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PPyeyp"&gt;Teams inside Twitter are researching ways for the company to offer paid subscriptions, which could include charging money for access to TweetDeck, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. TweetDeck is a popular alternative to the main Twitter website and mobile app that allows users to more efficiently manage multiple accounts and organize Twitter into a series of easier-to-read vertical feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UI1uHX"&gt;Alongside charging for TweetDeck, the teams are said to be exploring other ideas, including charging for new features like an “undo send” button or more profile customization options. Another idea involves introducing “tipping” to Twitter, where users could pay accounts for exclusive content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KORx1s"&gt;Twitter is thought to be exploring these plans as a way to reduce its reliance on advertising, which currently provides the majority of its revenue. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that competing ad businesses from Facebook and Snapchat continue to grow faster than Twitter’s, and the company is under pressure to diversify, thanks to the pandemic as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/10/21171477/jack-dorsey-elliott-silver-lake-deal-ceo-twitter-take-private"&gt;high-profile activist investors&lt;/a&gt;. Introducing a series of premium pay models to Twitter would be a bold move given most social media companies prioritize offering their services for free to maximize growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8ifyt8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter said plans are in the “very early exploration” stage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MpOjKc"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter’s head of revenue products, Bruce Falck, confirmed the company’s plans to improve its revenue mix “may include” subscriptions, but he stressed that its plans are in the “very early exploration” stage. “We do not expect any meaningful revenue attributable to these opportunities in 2021,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZBxTO"&gt;Twitter has been exploring some of these ideas for years. Back in 2017, the company considered charging for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/23/15043422/twitter-subscription-service-tweetdeck-survey"&gt;premium TweetDeck features&lt;/a&gt; before later abandoning the plans, and last year a customer survey &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/twitter-survey-reveals-the-subscription-options-its-eyeing-including-an-undo-send-option/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHDiKj3-9DGPXQKPafyuDvucuOSkK9DPen5Mh28KYkVuo2hwOK6fnKfFEiczD7fY5E8JMJ7odY2mYbkIL8oODJtO01B0Id8EmwP6cHwTTW0oHP0E0gTKe4LMMVDLGHn3xjAhKz58VMA0JCobhENrnFO561StKB5AGKZHiHh-lbbA#:~:text=Undo%20Send%3A%20A%2030%2Dsecond,before%20anyone%20can%20see%20it."&gt;revealed an interest&lt;/a&gt; in charging for an “undo send” feature. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that subscriptions have been mentioned on the company’s last two earnings calls, and just this past December, Twitter CFO Ned Segal said the company was exploring charging for features like “higher-quality video” and “analytics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xb0UU"&gt;Twitter is due to report its latest earnings tomorrow, so there’s a chance we might know more about its plans sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s global Mi 11 has a Snapdragon 888 for €749</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FP2bb3mf9m7tLypz32Ao6UV1i1s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785861/DSCF7497.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AD8JE"&gt;Xiaomi is announcing the international version of its Mi 11 flagship phone today after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;earlier release in China&lt;/a&gt;. No &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267807/xiaomi-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-phone-announced"&gt;wild waterfall displays&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;sci-fi wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; here — this device is very much in keeping with the Mi series’ MO of offering high specs at a competitive price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewFpet"&gt;The Mi 11 has a Snapdragon 888 processor, making it the first phone to launch with Qualcomm’s latest high-end chip (though Samsung’s Galaxy S21 series beat it to market outside China). The 888 has 5G connectivity built in, of course, and the phone has 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui8BMO"&gt;The screen appears to be the same panel — or very similar — to what’s found in the Galaxy S21 Ultra. It’s a slightly curved 6.8-inch 1440p OLED with a refresh rate of 120Hz and peak brightness of 1,500 nits, matching Samsung’s phone spec-for-spec. I don’t have the S21 Ultra to compare side-by-side, but I can tell you that the Mi 11’s screen is extremely good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/glOdoGDCdddN6sBSrVBINgfLPwk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288836/DSCF7498.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b9NQ2M"&gt;The Mi 11 has a 108-megapixel primary camera backed by a 13-megapixel ultrawide and a 5-megapixel “telemacro” camera. The selfie camera is 20 megapixels and tucked inside a small holepunch cutout at the top left of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgGWH0"&gt;The battery is 4,600mAh and can be charged at up to 55W with a cable and up to 50W wirelessly. The Mi 11 also features reverse wireless charging at up to 10W. It runs MIUI 12, based on Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3oZIn"&gt;Xiaomi hasn’t provided a full list of regions or launch dates just yet, but says the Mi 11 will be priced at €749 (~$900) for the 8GB/128GB model. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-11-launched-europe/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+xda-developers%2FShsH+%28xda-developers%29#pricingmi11:~:text=The%20Xiaomi%20Mi%2011%20is%20priced%20at%20%E2%82%AC749%20for%20the%208GB%2B128GB%20variant%20and%20%E2%82%AC799%20for%20the%208GB%2B256GB%20variant.%20As"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; the 8GB/256GB model will retail for €799 (~$960). Stay tuned for a full review. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood has stopped limiting GameStop shares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/09mlU72huS24d5vGOx4JjaV3NVM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68775730/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s39ore"&gt;Robinhood has finally lifted all the restrictions on WallStreetBets-fueled stocks like GameStop and AMC, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-idUSKBN2A51QV?taid=601d5c573cb4af0001e7e97c&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;report on Friday from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company currently lists no limits on its support document entitled “Changes due to ongoing market volatility,” whereas last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;there were 50-plus companies included on the list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObFw8p"&gt;Robinhood’s decision to restrict buying certain stocks caused a firestorm of controversy, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;harsh condemnations from major public figures and politicians&lt;/a&gt; and the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;being review-bombed&lt;/a&gt; on both Android and iOS. For its part, Robinhood said it wasn’t shutting trades down on a matter of principle or due to any shady deals with hedge funds, &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week"&gt;but because it simply didn’t have enough cash&lt;/a&gt; to meet its regulatory requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7GPwb"&gt;The day the restrictions were put in place, GameStop’s stock closed at $325. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266684/gamestop-stock-gme-down-dip-falling-wallstreetbets-reddit"&gt;Yesterday, it closed at $53.50&lt;/a&gt;, so it could be argued that the rush is now over. So Robinhood lifting the restrictions doesn’t matter as much anymore, as the massive volume of trading happening last week appears to have subsided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8V9au"&gt;With that said, GameStop stock has seen some activity today, at one point shooting up to $95 a share. At the time of writing, GME is back down in the low-$60 range, and there’s no telling what it’ll close at today. But for the moment, it seems like it’s at least looking a little better than it was yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s new concept phone has a waterfall display on all four edges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgGTlMqtQwPXYx4fLZv56jPtFZo=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68773384/EtcXdw7VoAEVfih.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jK59Er"&gt;Xiaomi has &lt;a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/02/05/xiaomi-debuts-its-first-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-smartphone/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its latest phone concept: a “quad-curved waterfall display.” This means that the unnamed phone’s screen not only has deep 88-degree “waterfall” curves on the left and right sides, but on the top and bottom as well, leaving no room for ports or buttons. Xiaomi says this is intended to “extend the limits of the display to infinity” and enable “a true, port-free unibody design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8of3rK"&gt;The obvious question is how that could possibly work at the screen’s corners, and based on the promotional imagery it looks like Xiaomi is simply leaving them blank with small, rounded cutouts. Not quite infinity, then, but still a neat trick — although for people who already don’t like the comparatively modest curved displays on phones like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, this sounds like their nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CbxKUBgz5BU8XR-wBqxC5EDGuI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22283412/mi.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bsJheq"&gt;Announcing a concept device entirely through renders doesn’t quite have the impact of showing it off in person, as was common pre-COVID. A Xiaomi representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this phone does actually exist and that they’ve used it themselves, for what that’s worth. The display is the result of “countless breakthroughs in glass bending and laminating technology,” according to Xiaomi, and “represents the sum of 46 groundbreaking patents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IO23F"&gt;This concept phone follows last week’s announcement of seemingly outlandish Xiaomi tech, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;“Mi Air Charge” truly wireless charging system&lt;/a&gt;. And back in 2019, Xiaomi revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/24/20881378/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-wrap-around-screen"&gt;the Mi Mix Alpha phone&lt;/a&gt;, which featured a display that wrapped around almost the entire device, though it ultimately never went on sale. This latest concept may well never make it into a commercially available device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o57Ycd"&gt;Xiaomi will announce global availability for its considerably more conventional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Mi 11 flagship phone&lt;/a&gt; at an event next Monday, February 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Niagara is a minimalist Android launcher I wish I’d had on my bus commute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHQI40ORAsdl-YM_pTV2MbVvYYk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771065/DSC00106.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Niagara Launcher puts your apps within easy striking distance of your thumb.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOd31n"&gt;After a couple years of beta testing, Niagara Launcher is now &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;available for download from the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s designed to replace the default Android app drawer and home screen grid with a layout that’s easier to access with one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZIrlX"&gt;You pick your favorite apps to pin on the home screen, and the rest are accessible under an alphabetized list on the right side of the screen in easy striking distance of your thumb. It’s quick and very responsive; you can either tap on the part of the alphabet you’re aiming for or swipe up and down to scroll your list of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eS7Yah"&gt;Niagara also allows you to take quick action from the home screen by swiping across any app to bring up a list of options, like setting a new timer in the clock app or starting a session with Strava. Favorited apps will also show a preview of notification content on the home screen, and a swipe will expand this to show the full text without opening the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ukD9Cp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Favorited apps will also show a preview of notification content on the home screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2csS7"&gt;These basic features are available with the free version, but customizing your home screen further with additional widgets and displaying your battery life percentage requires an upgrade to the paid pro version, which costs $6 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr5uw5"&gt;Niagara features a clever design, and it would really come in handy on a big phone. I also would have appreciated it on my standing-room-only bus commutes in the Before Time, when I often clung to a rail with one hand for dear life while checking my email with the other. It’s pretty handy on a smaller phone, too, for a more informative look at your notifications without requiring you to open an app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hONDG7"&gt;The free version does not contain ads, which is another plus. Yet while the launcher does offer the basics, it’s a little bit of a letdown that it doesn’t let you add something as simple as a weather widget without paying for the upgrade. Overall, though, Niagara offers a clean look and a unique solution for those of us with one-handed woes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is weighing an anti-tracking feature for Android, following Apple’s lead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7GqZ7rzl3eJHMMEzH_uM2rn3p38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770894/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OQOo4A"&gt;Google is considering developing an Android alternative to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;upcoming App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt;, a new planned opt-in requirement the iPhone maker will impose on developers that demands they ask for permission to track iOS users across apps and websites. The news, first &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/google-explores-alternative-to-apple-s-new-anti-tracking-feature?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, underscores the increasing pressure on large tech companies, many spurred on by Apple, to take more proactive measures to better protect user privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkP3j3"&gt;Google won’t say whether it is indeed working on an anti-tracking privacy measure for Android. But in a statement, a Google spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “We’re always looking for ways to work with developers to raise the bar on privacy while enabling a healthy, ad-supported app ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2S3M4"&gt;First announced at Apple’s developer conference last summer, App Tracking Transparency effectively slides a system-level opt in between an app’s tracking capabilities and a user’s preferences. If the user says they would rather not be tracked, there’s nothing the developer can do to get around that because Apple will disable a developer’s ability to gather the so-called Identifier for Advertisers code, or IDFA. That code both lets advertisers track users from one app or website to another for ad targeting while also helping advertisers measure the effectiveness of ads, such as whether a user ends up purchasing a product they saw on one app by using the mobile website of the merchant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vdCIpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s take on App Tracking Transparency may not be as severe&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CWkW9z"&gt;Apple intends to police developers using audits and other methods to enforce its policies, which include potentially suspending or banning apps from the App Store if a developer does not comply. Both Facebook and Google have publicly expressed concern for how Apple’s opt-in requirement could negatively affect their mobile advertising networks. But Facebook has gone a step further and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;begun waging a public relations war&lt;/a&gt; against Apple over the change by complaining it will harm small businesses and accusing Apple of being self-serving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNoHfl"&gt;Google’s take on App Tracking Transparency would likely not be as severe, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. Instead of forcing opt-in requirements on app developers, the Android alternative may resemble some of the upcoming privacy controls planned for Google’s Chrome browser, in which the company seeks to end some of the more insidious tracking technologies on the web today by developing less invasive alternatives and giving users more opt-out mechanisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf9YCA"&gt;Google’s work to develop new privacy practices and standards for the web is known as the &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;. As part of that ongoing project, Google has taken steps to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349538/google-changes-ads-data-cookies-privacy"&gt;phase out third-party cookies on Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and is working on tools that allow advertisers to target groups of users instead of directly targeting individuals. All of this could inform how Google develops an anti-tracking measure for Android, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter team up to crack down on hackers who steal rare usernames</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3xvqURkdPcl31BNC6cwc4Hxgy0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770421/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ssQNvO"&gt;Instagram has disabled hundreds of accounts that were stolen as part of online hacking operations designed to gain access to and sell rare and coveted usernames, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Both TikTok and Twitter also took action on some of the accounts belonging to the same hackers, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/02/facebook-instagram-tiktok-and-twitter-target-resellers-of-hacked-accounts/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KrebsOnSecurity+%28Krebs+on+Security%29"&gt;reports journalist and cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ6KGp"&gt;The Facebook-owned platform set its sights mainly on the community surrounding OGUsers, a website well-known for trafficking in stolen usernames and helping facilitate the hacking of these accounts through methods like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt;, which is when a user gains control of someone’s phone number and uses it to reset passwords and take control of social media handles. News of Instagram’s enforcement was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram-cyber-idUSKBN2A42HY"&gt;first reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKTe4L"&gt;“Today, we’re removing hundreds of accounts connected to members of the OGUsers forum. They harass, extort and cause harm to the Instagram community, and we will continue to do all we can to make it difficult for them to profit from Instagram usernames,” a Facebook spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The disclosure is notable because it’s the first time the platform has publicly shared information regarding moderation against username hackers. Earlier this week, Instagram released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262154/instagram-recently-deleted-feature-update"&gt;new feature that lets people recover deleted posts&lt;/a&gt;, in the event a hacker takes control of their account and wipes it clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bXQ8C5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook and Instagram are taking action against online username-stealing communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IwDrTZ"&gt;Krebs reported on Thursday that the crackdown was something of a joint effort, with Twitter and TikTok also taking action against popular OGUsers community members at the same time on those companies’ respective platforms (although it’s unclear how much coordination there was between the three companies or how far-reaching TikTok and Twitter’s enforcement was). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnmiCJ"&gt;“As part of our ongoing work to find and stop inauthentic behavior, we recently reclaimed a number of TikTok usernames that were being used for account squatting,” TikTok told Krebs in a statement. “We will continue to focus on staying ahead of the ever-evolving tactics of bad actors, including cooperating with third parties and others in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiNeLO"&gt;In addition to disabling the accounts that were stolen, rendering them worthless, the social platforms have also disabled some accounts of well-known OGUsers middlemen who act as intermediaries during username transactions by holding funds in escrow in exchange for a cut of the fee, reports &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydl6Sr"&gt;OGUsers made headlines last summer when a small cohort of hackers affiliated with the site allegedly participated in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327769/twitter-bitcoin-scam-news-updates"&gt;unprecedented Twitter hack &lt;/a&gt;that involved resetting the passwords on the accounts of dozens of high-profile individuals and companies, including Elon Musk and Barack Obama, and using their access to run a bitcoin scam. Like the individual at the center of the Twitter hack, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355746/twitter-hack-teen-hearing-zoombombed-zoom-call-judge"&gt;then-17-year-old Graham Ivan Clark&lt;/a&gt;, many of the hackers Instagram is cracking down on today and those who frequent OGUsers are minors, often drawn into the community by the allure of stealing and retaining a rare username of their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFNLnl"&gt;These usernames tend to be single words — in rare cases, individual letters or numbers — and they can fetch tens of thousands of dollars on underground markets for stolen digital goods. And because platforms like Instagram and Twitter have &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870"&gt;rules barring the buying and selling of accounts&lt;/a&gt;, the hackers interested in procuring one of these coveted handles often resort to illegal means to obtain them. SIM hacking is a popular method, but standard phishing as well as sustained online harassment, extortion, and even swatting are other known techniques, notes &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook blocked in Myanmar after users protest military coup</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAwt4K"&gt;Myanmar’s government has blocked access to Facebook in the country, after users turned to the company’s services to protest &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22260076/myanmar-coup-military-suu-kyi-explain"&gt;this week’s military coup&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement given &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/myanmar-blocks-facebook-access-after-coup-11612436184?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook confirmed&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the country’s telecoms providers had been ordered to block its services, adding, “We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with family and friends and access important information.” Myanmar’s government has ordered the services to be blocked until Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yK9O0"&gt;The block comes after users reportedly turned to the social network to protest after the military ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and detained her along with other members of her party. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that users on Facebook were sharing photos of themselves banging pots and pans as a sign of protest, as well as images of a three-fingered salute — a gesture that’s become a sign of resistance in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WDVKsH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook is the internet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RskwSX"&gt;Telecoms provider Telenor &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Myanmar-Coup/Myanmar-military-blocks-Facebook-as-activists-call-for-protests"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it has followed the government’s orders, saying it has “decided to comply with the directive, while expressing grave concerns regarding breach of human rights.” The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reports that an internet monitoring organization, NetBlocks, confirmed that Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all unavailable via the state-owned Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications’ network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzTrDH"&gt;Facebook is an integral part of Myanmar’s internet ecosystem. “For the majority of Myanmar’s 20 million internet-connected citizens, Facebook is the internet” was how a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bsr-facebook-myanmar-hria_final.pdf"&gt;report from 2018&lt;/a&gt; put it, and &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;notes that Messenger is the primary communications channel for most of its citizens. It’s believed around half of the country’s population holds a Facebook account, meaning any attempt to block the service is a significant move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GaOnI"&gt;This close relationship between Myanmar’s internet and Facebook has created problems. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18068104/facebook-business-social-responsibility-myanmar-report"&gt;Facebook admitted&lt;/a&gt; that it hadn’t done enough “&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/11/myanmar-hria/"&gt;to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence&lt;/a&gt;,” after critics said its platform had &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook-idUKKCN1GO2PN"&gt;played a role in genocidal violence in the country&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook said it was investing in “people, technology and partnerships to examine and address the abuse of Facebook in Myanmar.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NKSWW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
