    <title>YouTube makes it easier to save on data with new video resolution options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HotfZ2qKIRCQeaaRGBrz9LWKI2M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176603/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VbCxa0"&gt;The YouTube mobile app for iOS and Android now has new video settings that might make it a bit easier to save on data while watching video on the go (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/23/youtube-adds-even-more-video-resolution-controls-and-options-on-mobile/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Along with specific resolutions in the video player, you can now toggle between three separate modes that either favor video quality, data use, or whatever works best for your current internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBXfCp"&gt;You might already be familiar with “auto” mode as the default setting for most videos, which automatically adjusts video resolution depending on your current internet speed to give the best experience. YouTube’s new additions are the “higher picture quality” mode, which uses more data when not on Wi-Fi and defaults to 720p, and a “data saver” mode that maxes out at 480p.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bkG6Bx4FQtnsiKGWLwFjoM1myyk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465137/YouTube_resolutionsSettings.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s new video settings include options for “higher picture quality” and “data saver.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CtqSNK"&gt;While these umbrella modes are good for quick scenario-specific adjustments to resolution, you can still dig in and get granular with specific resolutions. And any resolution adjustments can be set for the specific video you’re watching or system-wide for everything you watch, with specific behaviors for Wi-Fi and mobile networks. YouTube &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200309015249/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/91449?hl=en"&gt;has had resolution settings&lt;/a&gt; and ways to keep the app &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/20/how-to-save-data-android/"&gt;from downloading / streaming HD videos&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but this automates the data-saving process and reframes it in a way that’s easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUORpPGbGr2gBBgSsO8L-W2-5L8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465170/youTube_settings.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video settings can also be applied system-wide, with separate behavior for mobile and Wi-Fi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIehp0"&gt;In an ideal world, none of this would matter and you could just watch high-resolution cooking videos (my preferred YouTube zone-out material of choice) to your heart’s content. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"&gt;But even on “unlimited” plans&lt;/a&gt;, most mobile carriers still cap video resolution at 480p. Videos watched at higher resolutions typically count against some kind of premium data allotment or other terrible carrier jargon and hit you where it hurts — in your monthly bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZl961"&gt;YouTube’s new video settings aren’t a magic bullet solution, but they make it easier to switch to a carrier-acceptable resolution without having to think about it. And when all my brain wants is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlJx9y9Toto"&gt;ASMR donut videos&lt;/a&gt;, that certainly helps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends reprieve, won’t take a cut of online classes and events until next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9YV-Fg0lbSGN7QOfXK9oShZhfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69173462/acastro_190322_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vl0knn"&gt;Apple announced on Wednesday that it’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6qfoid1d&amp;amp;1619114022"&gt;once again extending the deadline&lt;/a&gt; for requiring in-app purchases for iOS apps that sell access to online classes and group events until December 31st, 2021, effectively meaning it won’t impose its 30 percent cut on businesses providing those services until next year. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21595040/apple-developer-in-app-purchase-deadline-online-classes-events"&gt;extended the deadline initially to June 30th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but now developers have another six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TeBrI"&gt;Apple cites the ongoing pandemic as its main justification for the change, but we have to wonder if it might also have something to do with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;the Congressional antitrust hearings that have zeroed in on whether Apple and Google’s app stores are monopolies&lt;/a&gt;. Helping out small businesses by not taking its traditional 30 percent cut is an example Apple can now use to demonstrate how it encourages small businesses to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGWxmt"&gt;Wednesday’s &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/antitrust-applied-examining-competition-in-app-stores"&gt;“Antitrust Applied: Examining Competition in App Stores”&lt;/a&gt; hearing featured complaints from lost item tracker company Tile, who Apple is now in direct competition with thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s new AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and Match Group, whose Tinder dating app uses Apple’s in-app purchases for subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oDlVz"&gt;Not every company pays 30 percent. Apple doesn’t apply the same in-app purchases requirement to one-on-one classes like tutoring, so individuals can take other forms of payments and bypass Apple’s cut entirely. Apple’s also been criticized for quietly creating special deals for big companies like Amazon, where subscriptions sold on its Prime Video app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;are only subject to a 15 percent fee&lt;/a&gt;. (Generally, Apple doesn’t reduce its cut of subscription fees to 15 percent until users have been subscribed for a full year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGfuN5"&gt;After Amazon’s seeming sweetheart deal came to light, Apple launched a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021 where developers who earn less than $1 million in sales every year can apply to lower Apple’s commission to 15 percent on purchases — but only with Apple’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVIcV8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;Apple is now launching podcast subscriptions too&lt;/a&gt;, ones where podcasters can join by paying $19.99 a year plus 30 percent of each subscriber’s first year of revenue, then 15 percent after for subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC wants your thoughts on improving the shorter National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CfOzMoNMRHyN50Gx6z1f9burIoY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170974/akrales_180620_1777_0600.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQSbaz"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCC/status/1385250009092956161"&gt;has decided to look into&lt;/a&gt; letting people text the upcoming shortened National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number in a bid to increase accessibility and use of the service by those who need it most (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnHendel/status/1385243971044134920"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reporter John Hendel&lt;/a&gt;). Last May, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328600/national-suicide-prevention-lifeline-number-dial-988-fcc"&gt;FCC approved the creation&lt;/a&gt; of a new short code, 988, that will act as an easier-to-remember phone number for the lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQGTdJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that calling 988 will not connect you to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline until July 16th, 2022.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKURJ3"&gt;It’s worth noting that today’s approval is &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/rulemaking-fcc"&gt;just a first step&lt;/a&gt; and doesn’t mean that people will, for sure, be able to text the 988 number when it goes live in July 2022. However, it does mean that the FCC will be looking into making it a requirement for phone providers, and it will be accepting public comment on whether texting should be allowed. &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-lays-groundwork-text-988"&gt;According to its statement&lt;/a&gt;, the FCC would also like public comment on the implementation details before it starts drawing up actual rules, like what kinds of things people should be able to text the lifeline, what happens if a message bounces back, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="X1BwcY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAjrya"&gt;To provide a comment, you can go to &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filings/express"&gt;the FCC’s express comment page&lt;/a&gt;. The proceeding is 18-336.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgVB5v"&gt;While being able to contact the lifeline via phone or SMS with an easily memorable number is undoubtedly a good thing, it’s also worth noting that the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline also has a chat feature &lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;. The current hotline added the ability to accept text messages at 1-800-273-8255 in August 2020, but 988 is an easier number to remember, especially during times of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zYwg5"&gt;The proposal to add texting support to 988 wasn’t the only action the FCC took today to try to improve public safety. It also announced that it would be looking into increasing the reliability of the 911 emergency services network. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Fi is adding a less expensive unlimited plan with more limitations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yZmf1FtrGnXCdqqTuV29BTLvd0w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170096/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s MVNO wireless service adds another, more conventional plan option.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STPl05"&gt;Google Fi has announced a basic, less expensive unlimited plan called Simply Unlimited in addition to its current unlimited offering, now called Unlimited Plus. The new plan costs $60 per month for a single line and forgoes a couple of features available on the more expensive plan: international data and mobile tethering. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20869599/google-fi-launches-a-more-traditional-unlimited-plan"&gt;second time&lt;/a&gt; the MVNO has introduced a new unlimited plan, each marking a step toward a more conventional wireless plan pricing structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkjUS2"&gt;Simply Unlimited covers the expected basics of an unlimited cellular plan: unlimited data, calls, and texting in the US. While the newly dubbed Unlimited Plus (still $70 per month for one line) provides high-speed data and texting in over 200 countries for international travelers, Simply Unlimited only includes data and text in Canada and Mexico. The new plan doesn’t include hotspot tethering either, whereas Unlimited Plus includes high-speed tethering (subject to the plan’s 22GB overall limit on high-speed data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CCCtXg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cellphone plan fine print, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="T6LFvG"&gt;Offering a cheaper plan without tethering tracks with other basic unlimited plans from the big wireless carriers; they tend to include slower tethering or none at all. Fi seems to be taking one more step toward conventional wireless offerings as an alternative to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782436/project-fi-data-only-sim-deal-wireless-lte-tmobile"&gt;the unorthodox Flexible plan&lt;/a&gt; it launched with six years ago — and which is still available today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA announces new Battlefield mobile game launching in 2022 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SJanE04kl2-chP6eJeoS4Fw4JSg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168446/bfv_standard_16x9.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="luxSg9"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; series is headed to mobile devices. The hugely popular shooter franchise will make its debut on smartphones and tablets in a new game that’s set to release in 2022. The game will be developed by Industrial Toys in partnership with longtime &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; developer DICE, which is owned by Electronic Arts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NemQTF"&gt;“Make no mistake, this is a standalone game,” Oskar Gabrielson, the general manager of DICE, said in a blog post. “A completely different game from the one we’re making for console and PC, designed specifically for the mobile platform. It’s being built from the ground up by iToys to make &lt;em&gt;Battlefield-&lt;/em&gt;on-the-go a reality and you can expect a fully-fledged, skill-based experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHn9JQ"&gt;Shooters are some of the biggest hits on mobile right now, and EA is likely looking to capitalize on that popularity with the introduction of a mobile &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; title. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; had a colossal launch week when it debuted in 2019, reportedly racking up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;more than 100 million downloads&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350782/pubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent"&gt;just surpassed one billion total downloads in March&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr9qsM"&gt;Gabrielson also reiterated that DICE is hard at work on the next &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; game for consoles and PC, which is planned for release later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here is the purple iPhone 12, which is purple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iW_qOjdrAN-ln6gAgylVTAJ-pe0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168438/vpavic_4547_20210421_0022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A purple iPhone 12&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNuuh3"&gt;Apple managed to surprise us during its live stream event earlier this week by announcing a new iPhone. Well, a new &lt;em&gt;color&lt;/em&gt; for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini: purple. Apple sent one to us along with some sample AirTags and so we have duly taken some photos of this, a purple iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrgmXw"&gt;It’s a lightish shade of purple. One might be tempted to call it lavender, but to me it’s a bit more like a lilac or maybe a wisteria. It lacks the redness you’d expect in a mauve or the blue tones you’d see in a violet. There are many &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_(color)"&gt;shades of purple&lt;/a&gt;, but this one is what Apple went with and I like it. It’s unmistakable even at a distance, whereas the light green iPhone 12 models could be mistaken for off-white in certain light. I am also glad it doesn’t have a fancy name. It’s just “purple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnU4Uy"&gt;The purple iPhone 12 is in all other ways the same as the other colors of the iPhone 12: it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;very fast, has a very nice screen, 5G, and great cameras&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just a little more royal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will help you turn your old Galaxy phone into a smart home sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HMKZW7exSYWuuiHTrP72mMxRLlc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163892/Galaxy_Upcycling_at_Home.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature can alert you to the sound of a crying baby or turn on a lamp when light levels dip.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXHVnM"&gt;Samsung has launched a beta program to help put some older Galaxy phones to new uses. Owners of certain phones can download an update to turn the device into a smart home sensor with some neat functions — it can detect the sound of a crying baby or turn on a lamp when it gets dark. The program is limited to certain models launched in 2018 or later, which is fairly limited, but it’s a nice, accessible offering that could help users get a little more use out of their old devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iczh9A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-latest-innovations-for-a-better-normal-at-ces-2021"&gt;Announced at CES&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, the company is launching the program in the US, UK, and Korea starting today. By downloading a software update through the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/smartthings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SmartThings app&lt;/a&gt;, users can access two basic functions. The first is an audio sensor that detects the sound of a baby crying, pet barking or meowing, or a knock at the door. When it detects one of these, it sends an alert to your phone with a recording of the sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mb2b7M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Galaxy S, Note, and Z-series phones launched from 2018 onward are eligible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HX79N0"&gt;The other function is a light level sensor that can turn on a connected light automatically when brightness levels in a room fall below a certain threshold. Samsung says the update includes battery optimization necessary to keep the phone powered and functioning as a sensor for long periods of time, though the company doesn’t specify how long it would be able to run between charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E93Ex7"&gt;Galaxy S, Note, and Z-series phones launched from 2018 onward are eligible, provided they’re running Android 9 or later. Samsung says more devices will be supported in the future, which hopefully includes more budget-oriented devices that owners may be less likely to trade in. And if those limited functions don’t appeal, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21542079/phone-reuse-android-iphone-how-to"&gt;a lot more you can do with your old phone&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t mind a DIY approach.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ gaming triggers for Android and iOS phones are now available in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OnePlus Gaming Triggers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9IBv8bhhJPS1DIoqPBTiuPKee3Y=/0x0:1061x707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163839/oneplustriggers2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These can snap onto any phone thinner than 11.5mm&lt;/em&gt; | OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DJWt7y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1384771145606451205"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau tweeted pictures&lt;/a&gt; of some attachable gaming triggers the company has created, and they’re made for more than just OnePlus’ phones. &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/oneplus-gaming-trigger-may-confuse-your-senses-23665133/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SlashGear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2021/03/oneplus-mobile-gaming-trigger-accessory-oneplus-9-pro-video-games.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;noticed them being teased during the unveiling of the OnePlus 9 back in late March, but they’re available online now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395588%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers-ios-android-phone-mobile-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in India from the OnePlus site&lt;/a&gt; for 1,099 rupees, which converts to roughly $15. OnePlus hasn’t confirmed that these gaming triggers will be releasing globally, and the company wouldn’t comment on pricing and availability when I reached out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAJVet"&gt;These triggers can be clipped around the edge of most phones (any Android or iOS device, so long as they’re less than 11.5mm thick with a case on). If you want to do some mobile gaming but hate touch controls, these could provide a more intuitive, controller-like alternative to tapping on your screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bQs958"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We designed the OnePlus gaming triggers to be solid, responsive, pleasingly “clicky,” and, yes, beautiful. We also made sure they work with many other phones—because the best product design is one that leaves you free to make your own choices. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hJNa4Dsa5s"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hJNa4Dsa5s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1384771145606451205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f227p8"&gt;Each trigger appears to have just one shoulder button with an Omron switch that Lau says are “pleasingly clicky” to tap. Some of the pictures make it seem like there’s also a rear trigger, which would give you a second button to map, but OnePlus didn’t provide any further details on how the mechanism worked when I asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLkTjQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395588%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers-ios-android-phone-mobile-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to the product page&lt;/a&gt;, these triggers are interchangeable and can be fastened to your phone in whatever way is most comfortable to you. To use them, though, your game of choice needs to allow for deep customization of its touch controls, to the level of allowing you to move touch-activated zones to where these triggers’ conductive silicon pads clip onto your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6DdWb"&gt;If you’re serious about mobile gaming, these triggers could level the playing field if you’re up against gamers who are playing on phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5&lt;/a&gt; or others that feature ultrasonic sensors laid along their edge to mimic physical shoulder buttons. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346594/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-shoulder-buttons-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Black Shark 4 lineup&lt;/a&gt; features actual mechanical shoulder buttons built into the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8sP6Y"&gt;OnePlus’ option seems to be a solid, budget-friendly option for making your phone easier to game on, though there’s a downside if you value your phone’s expansive screen real estate: these clamps obscure parts of the screen. But if they’re as easy to clip on and remove as OnePlus’ photos indicate, I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirTags don’t have a built-in keychain loop, and we have some thoughts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsh9JcBTVaabDsfJuV2nAvrMoWk=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69162411/airtagaccessories.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CwaDy4"&gt;Apple’s new AirTag trackers are finally here after years of rumors. The $29 trackers work with Apple’s Find My network, utilizing both Bluetooth and UWB technology to help owners track anything from their keys to their bags. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzvFVZ"&gt;But the design of the new trackers is somewhat controversial: unlike most Bluetooth trackers, Apple’s iteration doesn’t include a built-in key ring loop. The subsequent debate has shattered the tranquility of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s newsroom over whether Apple’s somewhat Spartan design is brilliant or bogus. Well, at least between two of the most genteel &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers, Jon Porter and Chaim Gartenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/492kammhY61DFUGcSC-yVmeGOFs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458151/keychain.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artist’s rendering of an AirTag design featuring a keychain hole punch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qh75iy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon Porter, reporter&lt;/strong&gt;: Debate me, coward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KMiTJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim Gartenberg, news editor&lt;/strong&gt;: Gladly! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvGf9T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt;: Let’s start with a point that we’ll definitely both agree on: it’s a relief to see the AirTags’ battery is user-replaceable. It sounds like such a basic point, but considering Apple’s track record with its AirPods, Magic Mouse, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook line, Magic Keyboard — wait does anything else Apple makes have replaceable batteries? — it wasn’t a guarantee. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20901686/tile-tracker-mate-pro-slim-sticker-release-date-news-features"&gt;Tile’s keychain-focused Mate and Pro trackers&lt;/a&gt; have removable batteries, but its Sticker (which has a very similar form factor to the AirTag) doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HWw9NV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Brilliant or bogus?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOebJ1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: I will grant you that easily accessible, user-replaceable batteries are always a good thing. And on a whole, the overall aesthetics of the AirTags are nice, with a two-tone shiny white plastic / chrome back that’s vaguely reminiscent of the old iPods to me. But the overly sleek Apple design highlights the biggest issue I have here: there’s no built-in loop or hole to attach a key ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8Ur5Y"&gt;The AirTag is a product that’s designed to track your keys, and yet it offers no way to actually attach itself to those keys out of the box, something that’s practically table stakes from Tile, Chipolo, and virtually every other Bluetooth tracker from the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKNaTC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt;: I hear you, but I think Apple’s approach is better. It means it can sell just one version of the AirTag to track whatever item you want, rather than selling different devices whether you want to track your keys, or your bike, or your jacket. Just buy an AirTag and buy whatever accessory you need to attach it. And for what it’s worth, I really like the design of the little holder accessory they’re selling to attach the AirTag to a set of keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhwlMC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: That little &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHJ23ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-leather-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D6a69955a8a6ddce99e189acb007fb66a7a8f18e4729ee64e7b785b8e88b5246abab8110b9e5c815b2e8e74d5f263e66b2a7a391fb4c93d7f7a32238c65c707863e916aaeeebaa11b59a86351ea8281e57db77af4fcc7609d12ec0601e21a15603b9023598629f037ffbe58f82b035223&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22394644%2Fapple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory costs $35&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;em&gt;more than an entire AirTag&lt;/em&gt;. Even Apple’s cheapest AirTag case, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK0W3ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-loop%3Ffnode%3D6a69955a8a6ddce99e189acb007fb66a7a8f18e4729ee64e7b785b8e88b5246abab8110b9e5c815b2e8e74d5f263e66b2a7a391fb4c93d7f7a32238c65c707863e916aaeeebaa11b59a86351ea8281e57db77af4fcc7609d12ec0601e21a15603b9023598629f037ffbe58f82b035223&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22394644%2Fapple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $30 plastic loop&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn’t look like it’ll even be useful for attaching to keys. This is just Apple’s typical accessory tax, forced onto customers because of an intentional choice of aesthetic form over useful function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNKKxo"&gt;And don’t get me started on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX862AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-bag-charm%3Ffnode%3D6a69955a8a6ddce99e189acb007fb66a7a8f18e4729ee64e7b785b8e88b5246abab8110b9e5c815b2e8e74d5f263e66b2a7a391fb4c93d7f7a32238c65c707863e916aaeeebaa11b59a86351ea8281e57db77af4fcc7609d12ec0601e21a15603b9023598629f037ffbe58f82b035223&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22394644%2Fapple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hermès accessories&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VOt7rznNzumaSTrrkX8AFrjBc6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458169/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_5.57.30_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nmRXJl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay fine, I’m not going to argue that the $349 Hermès key ring isn’t incredibly stupid, and it would be nice if the leather key ring actually included an AirTag at that price. The setup is too expensive, period, and hopefully third-party accessory manufacturers will step in to fill the demand for cheap keychain holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="girWDS"&gt;But more importantly, I think separating the tech bit from the holder bit makes sense for an accessory that’s going to have to withstand so much abuse on a daily basis. Keys can be sharp, and they beat up anything that shares a pocket with them, so I’d prefer it if that thing that gets beaten up is a holder rather than the core piece of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t773Ho"&gt;Look at a Tile key fob tracker that’s been used for a couple of years, and it looks grimy as hell. I wouldn’t be surprised if some people end up replacing the whole device when the battery runs out, just so they can get a shiny new tracker. But when your AirTag keychain inevitably starts looking worse for wear, you just replace the holder rather than the tracker itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Co3luD8e5pkvGFCzcC1RfxhbWE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457308/yJBAy1w.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hywvlC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: These are all valid points, but you’re ignoring the fact that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fairtag&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22394644%2Fapple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;these accessories and protective cases&lt;/a&gt; could all exist in &lt;em&gt;addition&lt;/em&gt; to including a cutout to directly attach a key ring. There’s already a similar cottage industry of accessories for Tile’s trackers for those who want them, and with the marketing power of Apple behind it, there’s no reason to think that AirTags wouldn’t have eclipsed that level of interest from accessory makers, even if it did have a cutout for a key ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NM8Yi5"&gt;It’s not that cases are bad — Apple’s leather option does look great and is almost definitely a more robust option than my hypothetical cutout. But it’d be nice to give customers the choice, instead of just forcing them into an option that requires spending more money right from the start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D24Qfh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394331/apple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PwfbZF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt;: At a certain point, though, you’re running up against physical limitations, and Apple has to pick its battles. I’m already seeing some of our esteemed colleagues in Slack complaining about how thick these trackers are, which I’d wager is because Apple prioritized building in a removable battery. Adding a loop with enough space for a key chain to go through adds yet more bulk. You have to draw the line somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSBjAD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: Fair enough. So, Jon, are you buying an AirTag tracker? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naEYZZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt;: Honestly, I’m going to wait to see how the third-party accessories work out. If I can get a half-decent leather keychain holder for the equivalent of $20 or so, then I think it makes a lot of sense spending $50 all-in with the tracker itself. Yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pfzgre"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: I might buy one to stick in my luggage at some point, but I generally don’t lose my keys enough to need to invest in a tracker for them (famous last words, potentially). Especially not at the $65 price tag that Apple is asking for a full key ring setup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly reveals that iOS 14.5 will arrive next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TUSQo9wvznWlWZ9pyHG1BruKEuE=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158860/findmy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 14.5 will enable use of AirTag trackers to help locate tagged items using Apple’s Find My feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wYXsIE"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-introduces-airtag%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394200%2Fapple-ios-14-5-watch-os-7-4-mac-os-11-3-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;new Tile-like AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt;, the company has revealed that iOS 14.5 will officially arrive “starting next week” — as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Joanna Stern&lt;/a&gt;. AirTags go on sale April 30th and will only work with devices running iOS 14.5 or higher. Likewise, watchOS 7.4 and macOS 11.3 will also launch next week, as they support new Apple Podcast feature updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwDeAc"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267230/apple-ios-14-5-watchos-7-4-public-beta-unlock-iphone-apple-watch-mask"&gt;first launched the 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt; to the public earlier this year in February alongside watchOS 7.4 beta (no word on whether that’s arriving soon, too). Along with AirTag support, it will implement Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; requirement, which mandates that developers ask for permission to track users for ad targeting. The feature was announced last year and met with sharp resistance from Facebook in particular, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;argues that the move&lt;/a&gt; will harm small businesses that benefit from ad tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaQHf"&gt;iOS 14.5 also introduces some welcome inclusivity features, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;ability to change Siri’s voice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;new skin tone options&lt;/a&gt; for some emoji. Another feature we’ve appreciated in our testing thus far is Siri’s ability to learn which audio-listening apps you prefer for certain activities. This stops short of letting you select a new default app, like picking Spotify for all of your streaming music requests, but it’s a helpful evolution in any case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWsSBM"&gt;Of course, this feature may or may not make it to the final release, but we &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;know now when we can expect to find out which features made the final cut. Apple doesn’t say specifically which day we can expect 14.5, but when it does, iPhone users will be able to download the update in their phone’s settings as always.&lt;/p&gt;
