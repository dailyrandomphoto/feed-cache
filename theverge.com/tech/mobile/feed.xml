    <title>Arizona Senate skips vote on controversial bill that would regulate Apple and Google app stores</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Px9JIH"&gt;The Arizona State Senate was scheduled to vote on an unprecedented and controversial bill Wednesday that would have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;imposed far-reaching changes on how Apple and Google operate their respective mobile app stores&lt;/a&gt;, specifically by allowing alternative in-app payment systems. But the vote never happened, having been passed over on the schedule without explanation. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;watched every other bill on the schedule be debated and voted on over the senate’s live stream, but Arizona HB2005, listed first on the agenda, never came up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91sY1K"&gt;One notable Apple critic is now accusing the iPhone maker of stepping in to stop the vote, saying the company hired a former chief of staff to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to broker a deal that prevented the bill from being heard in the Senate and ultimately voted on. This is after the legislation, an &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;amendment to the existing HB2005 law&lt;/a&gt;, passed the Arizona House of Representatives earlier this month in a &lt;a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview?SessionID=123"&gt;landmark 31-29 vote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZo6Kk"&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show. The bill was killed in mid-air while on the agenda with a backroom deal. Apple has hired the governor’s former chief of staff, and word is that he brokered a deal to prevent this from even being heard,” said Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, a fierce Apple critic who submitted testimony in support of HB2005, on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1374842497000673289"&gt;Twitter this afternoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqFFBr"&gt;Apple declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kTduxV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzgvhY"&gt;It was well-known prior to today’s scheduled vote that both Apple and Google had hired lobbyists to combat the bill, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;because it directly threatened the companies’ industry standard app store commission of 30 percent. If the Arizona bill passed the senate and was signed into law by Ducey, it would have made the state a haven for app makers looking to sidestep the App Store and the Google Play Store’s payment systems, which are the mechanisms the companies use to take their cuts of all app sales and in-app purchases of digital goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2x3kDh"&gt;It could have also caused all sorts of additional headaches for both companies by forcing them to either institute a patchwork system of state-specific enforcement, or by potentially forcing them to stop doing business in Arizona altogether while opening the door to lawsuits against the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV9P5i"&gt;In testimony in front of the Arizona House earlier this month, Apple’s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, argued that the App Store provides enough value to developers to justify the 30 percent cut. “The commission has been described by some special interests as a ‘payment processing fee’—as if Apple is just swiping a credit card. That’s terribly misleading. Apple provides developers an enormous amount of value — both the store to distribute their apps around the world and the studio to create them. That is what the commission reflects,” Andeer said in written testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7QnRI"&gt;“Yet this bill tells Apple that it cannot use its own check-out lane (and collect a commission) in the store we built,” he added. “This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free — even if they’re selling digital goods, even if they’re making millions or even billions of dollars doing it. The bill is a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="p9yUEK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A number of Democrats publicly objected to the bill &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nV7sfp"&gt;It’s worth noting that the bill also faced considerable opposition in the Arizona House not by big business-loving Republicans, but instead by Democrats. A number of Democrats publicly objected to the bill and voted against it on the grounds it was potentially unconstitutional for interfering with interstate commerce and also that it interjected Arizona into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;California legal fight between game developer Epic Games and both Apple and Google&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Android and iOS platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj59JQ"&gt;The bill, which was primarily sponsored by Rep. Regina Cobb (R-5), is one of many that have popped up in state legislatures around the country challenging Apple’s and Google’s longstanding policies around the mobile app economy. These bills can be traced back to growing antitrust pressure against Big Tech mounting in both Europe and Washington, DC, and they &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-next-big-tech-fights-are-in-state-capitals-11615714201"&gt;represents a new local and state front in the ongoing fight over the tech industry’s outsize power&lt;/a&gt; and whatever methods lawmakers may employ to try and reign it in. Other arenas include California, where Epic launched its own fight, and the European Union. which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;launched antitrust investigations into the App Store and Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt; over anticompetitive claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJ2Wes"&gt;Both Apple and Google operate the two most dominant app stores in the world, and while the Google Play Store allows alternative app stores and therefore alternative payments systems, Apple does not. That means all digital purchases on iOS are subject to Apple’s mandated 30 percent cut, or in some cases a reduced 15 percent cut, though Apple has been criticized for cutting secret deals, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;those it has made with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; over Prime Video subscriptions and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;later in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;, to exempt certain types of purchases when it’s strategically convenient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zivmsg"&gt;Both companies in the last six months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt; to the commission structure that allows for smaller developers, which represent the vast majority of app makers on both Android and iOS, to claim a reduced 15 percent cut, though that has done little assuage the app store critics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jZ1f51"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These state app store bills have become lobbying battlegrounds between Big Tech and its fiercest critics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5OCugI"&gt;These antitrust proposals, like HB2005, are largely the work of the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF). The CAF is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;industry group formed last year&lt;/a&gt; consisting of Epic, Spotify, Tinder parent company Match Group, and dozens of other companies that have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo of the mobile app economy and the app store owners’ ironclad developer agreements. Some of these companies, like Spotify, have for years complained of unfair treatment from Apple and have accused the company of prioritizing its own software over competitors through its use of App Store rules and iOS requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORWNpa"&gt;The CAF began &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;lobbying lawmakers earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, first in North Dakota and now in multiple states including Arizona, to instigate the introduction of bills like HB2005. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;North Dakota bill failed&lt;/a&gt;, Arizona’s was seen as a more promising alternative because it focused solely on in-app payment systems, while the North Dakota one also mandated that operating system owners allow for alternative app stores, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOSu9z"&gt;“The legislative session is not over. We will continue to push for solutions that will increase choice, support app developers and small businesses and put a stop to monopolistic practices,” said Meghan DiMuzio, the CAF’s executive director, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="982M8k"&gt;Now, the bill’s fate is now in question, and it’s not immediately clear what happened. Rep. Cobb, the bill’s sponsor, did not respond to a request for comment. The Arizona governor’s office and the office of the Arizona State Senate Majority Leader Rick Gray (R-21) also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er7bnR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 24th, 10:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from the Coalition for App Fairness. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple picked a truly embarrassing time to wrongly reject a simple app update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Yt7HYh4fyFtuk8YPRZj7Yd-hKg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021141/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDnlbd"&gt;Apple has a rocky relationship with some iOS developers because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;its seemingly arbitrary decisions over what gets published and when&lt;/a&gt; — and now, because of a dumb miss, it’s being accused of putting profits ahead of human rights in Myanmar by the founder of ProtonMail and ProtonVPN, even though that’s probably not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0d777E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fapple-blocks-app-updates%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348961%2Fapple-protonvpn-app-security-update-rejection-myanmar-andy-yen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Proton founder Andy Yen writes&lt;/a&gt; that Apple blocked an important security update to the company’s privacy-protecting ProtonVPN software simply because Apple didn’t like the app’s description, specifically this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ifnRaK"&gt;Whether it is challenging governments, educating the public, or training journalists, we have a long history of helping bring online freedom to more people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S7sR08"&gt;If you’re having a hard time finding anything objectionable there, you’re not alone — but Apple told Proton it wasn’t okay to encourage “users to bypass geo-restrictions or content limitations.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ic-9MFpvsv7azZgAvWDNllRo0bs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395261/apple_blocks_protonvpn_update.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uEVg5e"&gt;The context here is that VPNs have become a critical tool for protesters in Myanmar to sidestep an huge internet crackdown during the country’s ongoing, bloody military coup. One researcher &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/myanmar-citizens-find-ways-around-crackdown-on-internet?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that VPN use has increased 7,200 percent since early last month, when the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266031/facebook-myanmar-blocked-instagram-whatsapp-military-coup-protest"&gt;blocked Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/6/22269831/myanmar-orders-block-twitter-facebook-instagram-military-coup"&gt;Twitter, and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0U1f9I"&gt;I’m with &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/03/apple_protonvpn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;’s John Gruber on this&lt;/a&gt;: I highly doubt Apple made a conscious decision to deny ProtonVPN to Myanmar — the company’s smart enough to know how that would look, and it’s not like the &lt;em&gt;app&lt;/em&gt; was blocked, just a security update. Yen is an outspoken critic of the App Store now, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;told Congress (and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) last year how he’d been strong-armed by Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6z9VyC"&gt;But the fact it’s just a security update makes the rejection &lt;em&gt;extra dumb&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;because Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299814/apple-app-store-policies-ios-bug-fixes-approval-dispute-appeal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;explicitly said&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; that it’d no longer hold up bug fixes because of these arbitrary guideline violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wKSyY"&gt;Regardless, Apple comes off looking a little like the bad guy here, especially now that ProtonVPN has taken the high road and ceded to Apple’s demands. “Due to the emergency situation in Myanmar, we removed the language about challenging governments which Apple found objectionable, and the app was finally approved,” Yen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x31FBS"&gt;That perception seems like it’s going to be increasingly hard to fight, now that antitrust scrutiny of Apple’s App Store has been heating up in Congress and the courts, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341511/apple-epic-trial-tim-cook-tim-sweeney-craig-federighi-phil-schiller-mark-rein-testify"&gt;the Epic App Store trial set to begin May 3rd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bj9fA"&gt;It doesn’t help when Apple is seemingly caught breaking its own rules and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;needing to apologize&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when it could be seen as retaliation against an app developer (Yen) who’d previously spoken out. Last year, many other developers weren’t willing to come forward and admit they’d been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;forced to add in-app purchases to their apps&lt;/a&gt;, specifically because they feared retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The lower-cost OnePlus 9R is official, and it sounds surprisingly strong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-zItN_GfnjTA-cyQGDGhjtf8Xho=/0x0:1203x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019938/colors_banners_color_1_banner0_pc_ae27cc_crop2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9R will be sold in black or blue color options.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Photo: OnePlus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kw3HcE"&gt;Yesterday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"&gt;OnePlus event&lt;/a&gt; covered the high-end 9 and 9 Pro, but outside of that spotlight, the company has quietly revealed a smartly specced, less-expensive model: the OnePlus 9R. CEO Pete Lau &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338504/oneplus-9r-less-expensive-phone-confirmed-india-5g"&gt;confirmed last week&lt;/a&gt; that the 9R was on the way and would launch in India. It’s now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2F9r&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348430%2Foneplus-9r-specs-price-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed on the company’s Indian website&lt;/a&gt; starting at ₹39,999, which is about $550. That’s an attractive price indeed, especially considering you’ll get one useful camera feature here that the $729 OnePlus 9 doesn’t have: optical image stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYMf0E"&gt;The 9R doesn’t include the Hasselblad-branded cameras on the 9 and 9 Pro, which isn’t actually a big loss. The 9 and 9 Pro offer newer hardware with features like bigger pixels and a higher-res ultrawide, so you do miss out on some nice upgrades, but the Hasselblad-developed color tuning is nothing special. You do, however, get a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera, which helps reduce blur from camera shake in lower lighting conditions. It’s unfortunately missing from the 9, though it is included on the $969 OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r08mIl"&gt;Other cameras on the 9R include a 16-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. This system is borrowed from the OnePlus 8T, which is wholly capable of good image quality, even though its macro and monochrome cameras aren’t very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cPKPAX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uVsRpJ"&gt;There’s a 6.55-inch 1080p OLED with fast 120Hz refresh rate — same as the OnePlus 9 — and a Snapdragon 870 processor with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. It’s not quite as powerful as the top-notch 888 processor on the 9 and 9 Pro, but it should be more than adequate to keep day-to-day tasks running quickly and smoothly. The 9R is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast wired charging, a handy OnePlus signature feature that delivers a full charge in just under 40 minutes. Wireless charging, however, isn’t offered. Oh, and there’s 5G support, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhBHSr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10410330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4H9RQj"&gt;All told, it looks like a series of smart trade-offs for almost $200 less than the flagship model. Right now, the phone is only confirmed to launch in India, but we’re hopeful that it will make its way to European and North American markets. While OnePlus brought its good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; to the US earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;midrange Nord&lt;/a&gt; never made it stateside. The 9R looks like an excellent candidate to fill in a wide gap between the budget N10 and the basic flagship model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL2w2Z"&gt;In the meantime, customers in India can preorder the 8GB RAM / 128GB version for ₹39,999 (~$550) or the 12GB RAM / 256GB model for ₹43,999 (~$600).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack quickly removes message invites in its new DM feature over harassment concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeg1Ys5n0Mwhu89m-bhJ-uZBMts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019365/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KM5YVb"&gt;Slack became a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348126/slack-connect-direct-messaging-dm-company-feature"&gt;public messaging platform this morning&lt;/a&gt; with the wider rollout of a new cross-organizational direct messaging feature, and now it’s already taking steps to mitigate the dangers of operating such a platform without well-thought-out moderation protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vExEfT"&gt;The company says in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348422/slack-connect-direct-message-abuse-harassment"&gt;concerns the feature could be used to send abusive messages or harassment with relative ease&lt;/a&gt;, it’s now disabling the option to send a message alongside an invite. That way, if someone knows your email address, they can’t spam your inbox with potentially abusive messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUEZct"&gt;“After rolling out Slack Connect DMs this morning, we received valuable feedback from our users about how email invitations to use the feature could potentially be used to send abusive or harassing messages. We are taking immediate steps to prevent this kind of abuse, beginning today with the removal of the ability to customize a message when a user invites someone to Slack Connect DMs,” Jonathan Prince, the company’s vice president of communications and policy, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hu7pTT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We made a mistake in this initial roll-out that is inconsistent with our goals for the product and the typical experience of Slack Connect usage.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drBGDz"&gt;“Slack Connect’s security features and robust administrative controls are a core part of its value both for individual users and their organizations. We made a mistake in this initial roll-out that is inconsistent with our goals for the product and the typical experience of Slack Connect usage. As always, we are grateful to everyone who spoke up, and we are committed to fixing this issue.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Om0TA"&gt;The overall concern, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891"&gt;first raised by Twitter employee Menotti Minutillo&lt;/a&gt;, was that the feature did not have robust opt-out protections for individual users and no way to easily prevent people from spamming you with email invites. That seems benign on the surface; if someone wants to harass you and they have your email address, surely they can just send you a harassing email. But Slack Connect bypasses any filters or inbox protections you may use by sending you an email from its feedback@slack.com address with the DM invite, with the email containing whatever message the sender decided to attach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8Gtbmd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;well that was easy as shit to abuse&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- send invite with nasty language&lt;br&gt;- slack emails you w/ the full content of the invite&lt;br&gt;- can't block the emails because they come from a generic slack address that informs you of invites&lt;br&gt;- abuser can keep inviting w/ abusive language &lt;a href="https://t.co/Mw9W5L251a"&gt;https://t.co/Mw9W5L251a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dWEAD7ccRO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dWEAD7ccRO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Menotti Minutillo (@44) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOfNXU"&gt;That means if your organization uses this feature, you can’t filter it out without fear of missing important Slack emails and you also have no easy way to opt out. (It’s not even clear right now whether the feature can be turned off for individual accounts.) &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/slacks-new-dm-feature-connect-is-thankfully-opt-in/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reported this morning&lt;/a&gt; that the DM feature would be opt-in for a company’s or organization’s IT department to enable at its discretion, but that doesn’t mean it would give individual employee’s active control over who could DM them. And there was also no filtering or monitoring in place that would detect whether someone was sending a hateful message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KVnXV"&gt;While Slack Connect is generally designed for enterprise users whose companies pay for premium features, a Slack Standard plan with Connect enabled costs as little as $8 per month per user (or $6.67 per month per user when billed annually). That suggests someone could exploit these issues rather easily and on the cheap if they choose to, even in the absence of the invite message feature Slack just disabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oU5hVm"&gt;There have been new concerns popping up, too, such as being able to view whatever Slack groups individuals are a part of — either paid or free ones — if that person happens to accept an invite from someone using Slack Connect. A Slack spokesperson has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; these fears are unfounded, as that information is only displayed to the person accepting the invite as a method of determining what Slack workspace they’d like to accept the invitation from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RFLtRD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This has been retracted — turns out it was a mistake by the original tweeter.  However, the information leak around profile listings has been confirmed: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ky3qJYCcv8"&gt;https://t.co/ky3qJYCcv8&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ePoDQuU4En"&gt;https://t.co/ePoDQuU4En&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eleanor Saitta (@Dymaxion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dymaxion/status/1374786160048898053?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B7FDY2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 24th, 4:12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added clarification from Slack specifying that the profile information leak concerns regarding DM invites are unfounded, as the information is not made publicly available to the sender. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Realme 8 Pro is a £279 phone with a 108-megapixel camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ubo6dDC2rRLGJ6oq7Zg8yLLVzc8=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017408/realme_8_Pro_i.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Realme says the slogan printed on the rear panel glows in the dark.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Realme&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rG6WfA"&gt;Officially launching in the UK today, the Realme 8 Pro is a budget device that’s one of the first to use the new Samsung ISOCELL HM2 108-megapixel sensor in its main camera. While similar high-res sensors have been more common in pricier phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, this chip is designed for lower-cost devices like the 8 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpxx9s"&gt;This 108-megapixel chip isn’t the same one used in the S21 Ultra or even last year’s S20 Ultra. It’s a smaller sensor — 1/1.52-inch versus 1/1.33-inch — with slightly smaller 0.7μm pixels. However, it uses the same binning approach to improve light-gathering abilities by combining neighboring pixels into a less noisy 12-megapixel image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mtIclz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10409112"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k13i6x"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro offers a 6.4-inch OLED screen, a Snapdragon 720G processor with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,500mAh battery that supports 50W fast charging. The back of the device, which comes in blue and black variants, features some intense Realme branding with the company’s “Dare to Leap” slogan in large fluorescent lettering that — the company claims — glows in the dark. Realme also says the design will appeal to “a new generation of younger users,” which we’ll have to take its word for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1harqp"&gt;The 8 Pro will go on sale on March 31st in the UK for £279 (about $380).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvP5M2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nHpGB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is reportedly developing a Switch-like Android gaming device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikfFenLqMUTOEmShlBnyFzRdLUo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69015226/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h9d2E"&gt;Qualcomm is reportedly working on an Android-powered, handheld gaming console that’s similar to a Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/23/exclusive-qualcomm-is-planning-an-android-powered-nintendo-switch-knockoff/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374447139921686528?s=20"&gt;editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;. The device would be powered by Qualcomm’s silicon, and could hit store shelves by next year — if it ends up being a real product at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWFYl7"&gt;According to the article, which cites images seen by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;, the device would feature detachable, Joy-Con-like controllers, an SD card slot, Android 12, and (of course) 5G. Also noted, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821"&gt;corroborated by Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, is a huge 6,000mAh battery. While the physical dimensions aren’t clear, Rahman tweeted that the screen could be 6.65-inches, with a resolution of at least 1080p (the Switch’s screen is 6.2-inches and runs at 720p). He also indicated that it could have a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueTznf"&gt;In other words, the device sounds like a big smartphone with attached controllers and active cooling, though that may not be a bad thing — the Switch kind of looks like a giant phone too. But it also has a library of great games that only it can play, which is its biggest draw. While there are plenty of good gaming experiences to be had on Android, from retro emulators to games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact, &lt;/em&gt;Qualcomm would have to give customers a reason why they should play those games on a separate device, rather than on their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered gaming phones&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346594/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-shoulder-buttons-specs-price-release-date"&gt;built-in buttons&lt;/a&gt; or controller accessories (or on their regular phones).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with a controller accessory.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SD5rUT"&gt;Or at least, it will if it’s trying to sell the device to people — the &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; article indicates that Qualcomm does want it to be commercially available, potentially at carrier retail stores. It also says that the price target for the device is $300, the same as a full-sized Switch. Currently, the cheapest phone I found with Qualcomm’s flagship 888 processor, the Realme GT 5G, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314043/realme-gt-5g-snapdragon-888-china-price-specs"&gt;costs roughly $430 (and is only sold in China).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0vi1Z"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821?s=20"&gt;Rahman notes&lt;/a&gt; that his source believed the product was closer to a reference design than something that would ever see store shelves. Chipmakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147912/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-vr-ar-xr-platform-reference-design-announcement"&gt;including Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, often build sample devices to help other manufacturers design around their SOCs or radios. Sometimes, these reference products &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573577/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-news-specs-features-price"&gt;even end up being sold by other companies under different brands&lt;/a&gt;, known as whitelabeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="AfvwLA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s understandable why Qualcomm would be eying the handheld gaming market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg2LZl"&gt;It is worth noting that the disagreement between the sources could be due to uncertainty from Qualcomm itself — &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;believes this project is almost a year from being finished, so the company may not yet know for sure what it wants this to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2F5l7"&gt;Whether the device ends up as a product or not (it could easily get canceled before it makes a public appearance), it seems like Qualcomm is actually designing and building a dedicated Android gaming device. It’s understandable why the company would be eying the handheld gaming market: it’s been heating up since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/31/4573596/nvidia-shield-review"&gt;Nvidia’s handheld Shield&lt;/a&gt; idea turned into the Nintendo Switch, with high-powered gaming phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;Windows PCs with Switch-like form factors&lt;/a&gt;, and a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/29/21406254/nintendo-modder-custom-wii-game-cube-game-boy"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"&gt;classic handheld redesigns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/1/18648304/playdate-hands-on-panic-keita-takahashi-bitsummit"&gt;novelty pocket gaming systems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You probably haven’t used Yahoo in a while, but what if it cost you money?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3heApRjmByH4d25O6ZmLDtcsO_o=/109x0:1729x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013874/1616443602945.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verizon Media Group&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SbGYfH"&gt;Yahoo is the legacy Web 1.0 brand that just won’t get dragged and dropped into the trash bin of history, and that’s largely thanks to Verizon’s tireless efforts to keep it going after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/25/12269898/verizon-acquires-yahoo-4-billion-marissa-mayer"&gt;buying the company a few years ago for nearly $5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, the telecom giant actually wants to &lt;em&gt;expand&lt;/em&gt; the Yahoo brand to all of its consumer-facing web properties with a new series of subscription offerings organized around what it’s calling Yahoo Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-media-subscription-yahoo-plus-05a8abb3-d871-4870-8bba-161a394e8cf1.html"&gt;according to a new report from &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA85FF"&gt;It’s important to mention right now, before we go any further, that the official Verizon Media Group branding provided for Yahoo Plus stylizes it as “Yahoo!+,” with that deranged cousin of the interrobang slapped onto the end of it. Apparently “Oath,” which was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18064172/verizon-oath-media-group-rebrand"&gt;previous incarnation of Verizon Media Group&lt;/a&gt; and technically the division that swallowed Yahoo after the acquisition, was not the end of the company’s poor naming decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4dzrC"&gt;If Yahoo Plus (we’re going to drop the exclamation point and the plus sign) sounds like a streaming service, you’re right. It certainly does, but it’s not. Yahoo Plus will instead be a kind of hybrid media portfolio of various Yahoo products and services, including its finance platform; its very-much-still-alive email platform; its media properties, including &lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch;&lt;/em&gt; and its fantasy sports service, among others. But in all seriousness, there is a sizable business here: Verizon tells &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; it already has 3 million existing customers  of subscription products it offers across services like Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Fantasy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpkVOt"&gt;In some cases, customers of Yahoo Plus will pay for extra premium features, while in others — like the &lt;a href="https://payments.mail.yahoo.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwo-aCBhC-ARIsAAkNQivyRx3IKbEi-yYRii-RPxoqHMlTQXzQ6J8KlojcR5isdVyu98kUGH4aAsenEALw_wcB&amp;amp;ncid=dcm_271619786_465330143_130623920"&gt;existing subscription version of Yahoo Mail&lt;/a&gt; called Yahoo Mail Pro — you’ll pay to remove ads, &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports. We don’t know how Verizon plans to bundle this as Yahoo Plus, or whether it will charge for each one separately and how much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lbemIq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is “Yahoo!+” better than “go90”? The jury is still out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KjfBQ3"&gt;The bigger picture here is that Verizon is acknowledging a hard reality after the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-takes-46-billion-write-down-for-media-unit-that-ncludes-aol-yahoo-1544556371-0c9f6649-7b9b-4d17-861e-4302ab6b477a.html"&gt;write-down of its entire media business&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018 (just a year after the Yahoo deal closed) and the unceremonious end of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17516266/verizon-shutting-down-go90-original-video-content-app"&gt;unsuccessful proto-Quibi streaming app go90&lt;/a&gt;. And that is that the whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15180622/oath-aol-yahoo-verizon-ad-tracking-privacy"&gt;targeted advertising play it was hoping to pull off&lt;/a&gt; by combining its telecom analytics, AOL, Yahoo, and its various other corporate tentacles is simply not equipped to take on the Facebook-Google duopoly in online advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu3k4V"&gt;So Verizon is now trying subscription models. Those are certainly all the rage in media these days. After all, collecting recurring direct payments from consumers is the only surefire way to inject any stability in an ad market largely dominated by Big Tech and susceptible to cataclysmic downturns, like &lt;a href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/global-ad-market-will-take-years-to-recover-from-covid-19/44417"&gt;what happened last year when the COVID-19 pandemic set in&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWYLmC"&gt;That brings us back to Yahoo Plus. While it may seem silly to continue leaning on the brand perhaps best known for signaling an email address that’s remained unchanged since high school, the Yahoo brand is admittedly resilient and about as close to a household name in websites as you can get outside the major Silicon Valley corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjG1rN"&gt;”Yahoo is the future of our consumer facing brand,” Joanna Lambert, Verizon Media’s consumer chief, told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;. “From a strategy perspective, we have enormous scale that is unlike most media companies in the world. The question becomes, ‘how do we take that audience and drive them from being free users to subscribers of really valuable paid offerings?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnJFx0"&gt;Lambert is right about the massive scale of Yahoo properties — they’re still among the biggest on the web. And if Verizon can somehow pull off a series of subscription services that actually complement its ad business, then it’ll have truly breathed new life into the Yahoo name. We’re just still a little unsure on the whole “Yahoo!+” thing. Let’s hope it rethinks that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Black Shark 4 is a high-end gaming phone that doesn’t look like one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JGL_i_mPrY1EJJPr0AAesrtdPfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013017/blackshark4lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Black Shark&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b0JyVN"&gt;Xiaomi’s Black Shark brand has announced its fourth series of gaming phones, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro. They improve on the previous series in most of the ways you’d expect them to. There’s a faster processor, moving up to the Snapdragon 870 in the standard Black Shark 4 and the Snapdragon 888 in the 4 Pro. Both phones also come with fast LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage, though each will come in different configurations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRMexn"&gt;The Black Shark 4 starts with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for 2,499 Chinese yuan (roughly $383), while the 4 Pro starts at 3,999 yuan (about $613) and has 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage. These will debut in China on Friday, March 26th, while the company says an overseas launch will happen “in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_Mx00wD3oxIHN5IALpYcuXk53Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391953/blackshark4sidebyside.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ESP2tF"&gt;As is almost a given in the realm of gaming phones, Black Shark has leap-frogged Asus and RedMagic — some of its biggest competition in the niche gaming phone space — when it comes to touch sampling rate or how many times the display can register a touch. Both the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have a 720Hz touch sampling rate with a 8.3ms touch delay, which it claims to be an industry best. This spec likely won’t make a difference in most people’s day-to-day usage of these phones, but some hardcore gamers might care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLrvVy"&gt;Both phones have the mechanical shoulder buttons introduced in the previous Black Shark phones, though the company claims it has improved their look and feel with “magnetic power lift” tech, making them feel more tactile to click, as well as fitting more seamlessly into the phone’s design. Speaking on the look of these new phones, they’re decidedly more attractive than the previous models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S6jLWEc3wGctuQNIizIKHw8NDRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16333859/jbareham_190611_3481_0177.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Black Shark 2, which introduced the pressure-sensitive display that lets you map two functions to one spot on the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tRWYlT"&gt;In addition to the shoulder buttons, these phones still have a pressure-sensitive display that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/15/18678066/black-shark-2-xiaomi-gaming-phone-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;I really liked in the Black Shark 2&lt;/a&gt;. With the shoulder buttons and a screen like this, you can re-map the controls of a mobile game to be a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWJFBm"&gt;Unlike last year’s model, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have displays that are the same size. They both have 6.67-inch OLED screens with a 144Hz refresh rate. Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that I recently reviewed, these phones have dual front-facing speakers with claims that they have good spatial audio separation. Also like that Asus phone, Black Shark announced that a fan accessory called the FunCooler 2 Pro can be attached to keep it cooler. The price for that is 199 yuan (about $30).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro compare to Samsung and Apple’s flagships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKDulDnquWhD6th6oQGvjqSrOwY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012037/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z2apGE"&gt;OnePlus has released its new batch of phones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. As is the tradition with OnePlus, the phones are equipped with the latest high-end Snapdragon chips and are priced lower than most of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCTwOi"&gt;Both phones also include charging features that Apple and Samsung don’t match: they wirelessly charge at a super-fast 50W and can charge at 65W over wired charging. They also both have Hasselblad’s camera tuning and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL56px"&gt;The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro are very similar, but there are a few differences to watch out for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wplcfE"&gt;The Pro has a bigger screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qFZmMi"&gt;The Pro includes a telephoto camera and mmWave 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xo4nmt"&gt;The unlocked and T-Mobile versions of the Pro have IP68 certification — only the T-Mobile version of the regular phone is IP68 certified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DBUo47"&gt;The Pro includes “Hyper Touch” where it polls for finger input at 360Hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="sEpiag"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="huTYVv"&gt;At retail prices, the regular OnePlus 9 is $70 cheaper than Samsung’s regular Galaxy S21 and $100 cheaper than the iPhone 12. Both of those phones include mmWave and IP68 water resistance. But if those aren’t features you care about, it may be worth the savings to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C0bSQN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10408117"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u8R0H1"&gt;The 9 Pro can’t quite match the all-out specs and features of the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but it’s also priced well below it, too. For fun, we also threw in Oppo’s latest flagship phone, which isn’t available for purchase in the US but is pretty similar to the Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xLuIpT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10408119"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Fast charging and elegant software offset a so-so camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KqtAyf"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is a legitimate flagship phone that is genuinely competitive with the best Android phones on the market — at least from a features and quality perspective. Yet in terms of market and mind share, it’s still destined to be a niche device for a small group of enthusiasts looking for a specific kind of elegance in their Android device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAjS4O"&gt;And that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0Ns9M"&gt;If you live in the US and you’re buying an Android phone, chances are very high that you’ll end up with a Samsung Galaxy phone. Samsung has the carrier relationships, quality, and marketing that have led directly to market share. LG, Motorola, and even &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america"&gt;sell more phones here than OnePlus does&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4shcPS"&gt;But after nearly seven years and dozens of phones, OnePlus has established itself as a brand that can make great phones that are serious alternatives to the mainstream. The $969 OnePlus 9 Pro achieves that goal with only a handful of notable compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2jYBg"&gt;OnePlus’ flagship phones always come with a laundry list of top-of-the-line specs, but what makes the OnePlus 9 Pro good isn’t the numbers; it’s how well those specs translate into one of the best experiences you can get using Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHu1Vy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi-pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"This $159 OnePlus Watch is OnePlus’ first smartwatch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22334322/oneplus-watch-smartwatch-features-price-specs-battery"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro announced with Hasselblad-branded cameras ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hpoEZD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10406462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design, but won’t support 5G on all networks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjdZe-bk4k4KgMTns8qChqCoZ-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388892/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design but won’t support 5G on all networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bQiCrq"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro hardware design and 5G support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rZIXVc"&gt;The hardware design on the OnePlus 9 Pro is the most seamless, elegant phone that the company has designed to date. It is, of course, big. It has a 6.7-inch screen that goes from edge to edge in a body that’s narrow enough to make it just barely usable for me in one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MZ4NI"&gt;What I can’t help but notice is how far OnePlus has come in build quality. The glass on the front and back curves into the aluminum rail on the edges with no seams at all. It’s well-balanced, beautiful, and solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Top: OnePlus 9 Pro; bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTvlAj6Darv2g-R9N0QJ9O44UZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389264/oneplus9progalaxys20plus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top: OnePlus 9 Pro. Bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It has a three-stage ringer switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAp70uBpGGWtFpcHUizuZRTE4QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388880/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0054_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has a three-stage ringer switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYWqZR"&gt;It’s also the spitting image of a Galaxy S20 Plus. Shift a couple of buttons around, move the selfie camera to the middle, and swap out the logo, and it’s the same design. I get that there are only so many ways to sandwich curved glass and aluminum together, but it’s uncanny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSjJvc"&gt;To be fair, OnePlus does keep some of its identity in the three-stage ringer switch, which easily lets you toggle between a ringer, vibration, and fully silent. It may still be my favorite feature on OnePlus phones, and I remain baffled as to why more Android phone makers don’t adopt a physical ringer switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVSttu"&gt;Speaking of vibration, the haptics on the OnePlus 9 Pro aren’t sloppy at all, unlike many Android phones. Unfortunately, the trade-off is that they aren’t very strong; I often can’t feel it vibrate in my pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6vr0E"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has the top-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is paired with eight gigs of RAM on the 128GB model. You can’t get it in a smaller screen size, but you can spend $100 more to get 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. There’s no microSD card slot for storage expansion in either model. What you get is what you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMXoXr"&gt;It supports both Sub-6 and millimeter-wave (mmWave) styles of 5G, but there’s a significant caveat: the phone supports it, but OnePlus has only managed to land 5G certification from its carrier partner, T-Mobile. If you buy it unlocked, as of now, it will only work with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Everything else will be LTE. AT&amp;amp;T 5G support doesn’t appear to be in the cards at all, and as for Verizon, OnePlus says that it “continues to work with Verizon to certify both the 9 and 9 Pro on its 5G network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyFkyRjI2k4qCPN085Bz4kQTDBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388875/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w5puLi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro battery and charging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zfl3AK"&gt;For OnePlus, the standout spec is its proprietary charging technology. There’s a 65W charger included in the box, and it can charge up the phone ridiculously fast. The phone’s 4,500mAh battery is actually split in two, which helps further speed charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYtldbablBg79ONjjiRExDVLu8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388874/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJcrVY"&gt;If you like, you can spend an additional $69 on OnePlus’ new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger. It charges at 25W, but since the battery is split, it’s essentially the same as charging at 50W, wirelessly. It also works if you set the phone on the charger in landscape mode. With the phone fully dead, it charged completely in 45 minutes. With ambient mode in Google Assistant on, it took a bit longer — but it was still wicked fast compared to other wireless chargers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1P12A6"&gt;That 4,500mAh battery was enough to get me through a full day and a half of moderately heavy usage. However, OnePlus phones do tend to be a little more variable in their battery life depending on use. Spending a day shooting 4K video and pushing the processor with games meant I could kill it with less than four hours of screen-on time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fG6qV"&gt;So while the battery life might not be best in class, the way OnePlus has built its ecosystem for charging means I’m able to top off faster than I can with other phones — provided I use OnePlus’ proprietary chargers, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5cHhLu_Wn4xSxFlJ9pZp5KWWUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388890/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0066.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X8qQlG"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OAFOOG"&gt;After wireless charging, the next standout spec on the OnePlus 9 Pro is that 6.7-inch screen. Like Samsung, OnePlus has switched over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;an LTPO style of OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which can be more power efficient and allows the company to have more control over the refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ9Qor"&gt;The screen can go all the way from 120Hz on down to 1Hz, depending on what’s happening on the display. OnePlus has branded the touch response rate on the screen as “Hyper Touch,” clocked at 360Hz for certain games, and though I am dubious it makes that big a difference for gamers, OnePlus says it could. More consequential is the screen resolution: 1440 x 3216 at 525ppi. You can leave it at that high resolution and have the high refresh rate screen going at the same time. Doing so probably hits battery life, but to me, the point of this max-spec phone is to max the specs, so I didn’t turn down the resolution or the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yI05D4"&gt;Those are the specs on the screen, but it’s the experience that matters. And again, I think OnePlus has done a remarkable job here. Something about the tuning of the animations in OxygenOS makes this phone feel just a little bit smoother than even Samsung phones. I also appreciate the color tuning — although it’s not as subdued as an iPhone or even a Pixel, it’s more restrained than Samsung’s default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBNXzq7K6YNBtQHo8bKFRoCNvZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388879/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid but has room to improve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0avD9X"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bt7aQC"&gt;Without delving into a lot of history, I will just point out that until very recently, camera quality has been the main downfall for OnePlus phones. It’s a particularly bad way to fall down, too, because often, the clearest and simplest way to compare phones that otherwise look and perform nearly equivalently is to look at the photos they take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95RI9o"&gt;OnePlus knows all of this and wants to position the OnePlus 9 Pro as a heads-up competitor — or at least a viable alternative — to the very best Samsung and even Apple have to offer. So it did a thing a lot of challenger brands do: called in a ringer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9j19S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hasselblad partnership is only about color tuning and interface design this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xt3br"&gt;That ringer is Hasselblad, which OnePlus is partnering with to improve its camera results. It will be a multiyear effort, and it’s far from guaranteed it’ll be a fruitful partnership. In fact, most of these sorts of deals don’t really do anything notable when it comes to the camera’s quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhWaA4"&gt;This year, Hasselblad’s participation with OnePlus’ development process amounted to helping the company tune the colors from the camera and lending a bit of its interface to the camera’s Pro mode. Oh, and most importantly for OnePlus, Hasselblad allowed its logo to be stamped next to the lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOkITZ"&gt;I do think there’s some credit due to this color-tuning influence. In the same way that other smartphone brands have a “look” to their photos, I think OnePlus is developing its own. iPhone photos are generally flat and neutral, tending to the warm side of color; Pixel photos contrasty and blue; and Samsung photos have the vibrancy slider set to max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro: indoor with mixed lighting handles color well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus tends to ramp up blue colors, which is usually fine but can sometimes get the camera into trouble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus does a good job not adding too much vibrancy when it’s not there in the first place" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XaIF0PK3g-pGh0OMJy-SxrBH9XU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389336/15_LE2125_IMG_20210313_110553.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus does a good job of not adding too much vibrancy when it’s not there in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vFHBSJ"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s image output lands mostly in the middle. It tends toward blue, and it definitely lifts up shadows to create more even lighting. Its photos are more striking but less accurate than what you’ll get out of an iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yYysn"&gt;The camera system is good, but it can’t quite match the quality you get from an iPhone 12 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra — both of which cost more than the OnePlus 9 Pro. It handles a variety of conditions quite well, but sometimes I just had to take an extra beat to compose my shot. It let me better judge what the viewfinder was showing and, honestly, gave me time to try the shot again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ps0XCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GnGiG3"&gt;As usual with smartphone cameras, I think the difference comes down to software. I like the colors the 9 Pro produces, but sometimes it just tries too hard and whiffs. Similarly, OnePlus seems to want to bring a little of that Pixel contrast magic to bear but instead just oversharpens. And lightening shadows is sometimes laudable, but not when it adds completely unnecessary and distracting image noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF7YOM7t6e5tB0A06yC8faoLao4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389355/18_LE2125_IMG_20210313_112304.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDooOLmKNWq0aQR0K3UtcKZlt6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389354/06_LE2125_IMG_20210311_160459.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jmns55"&gt;The main camera uses a new 48-megapixel Sony sensor with OIS, though when I pressed OnePlus to tell me what exactly that sensor brings to the table, I didn’t really get a clear answer. You can shoot 12-bit RAW images in the Pro mode (which is two bits more than last year, if you’re keeping count). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noaYb1"&gt;That’s all nice, but the interface on Pro mode is what gets me. You can clearly see what’s set to manual and what’s in auto mode. It’s simple and easy to use, too. Best of all is focus peaking, which draws little lines over the part of the image that’s in focus. It is a lot clearer and more fun to use than the tap-to-focus you need to use on other phones. (You can do that here, too, of course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qMoum"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s other cameras include a big, 50-megapixel ultrawide with a sensor that’s quite a lot nicer than the usual step-down sensors ultrawides get stuck with. I loved using it right up until it went haywire with sharpening. OnePlus put in a custom lens to help with distortion at the edges, and it works as well or better than pure software fixes at keeping straight lines from bowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGBpJb"&gt;The telephoto camera is 3.3x, and it’s not anything special at that zoom level. Beyond it, digital zoom is kind of a mess. It gets pantsed by the S21 Ultra with its periscope-style lens. There’s also a monochrome camera that serves only as a helper for the rest of the system, but I suspect it’s not doing anything especially important. OnePlus did drop the gimmicky and pointless “color filter” camera from last year’s 8 Pro this time around. It will probably drop the monochrome camera next year, if I had to guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="exkR3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TReqrH"&gt;OnePlus’ software-focused Nightscape mode works really well for capturing nighttime shots, although to my tastes, it over-brightens the image. Portrait mode is a mixed bag; heads often look artificially cut out from the blurry background. Again, I can get good shots, but portrait mode was often one of those situations where I needed to try the shot a second time. The selfie camera is passable in good light but falls down fast in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkqOPE"&gt;Unfortunately, video is equally messy. The OnePlus 9 Pro will let you shoot up to 8K 30 or 4K 120, but neither looked good. In fact, regular old 4K 30 has that overprocessed and oversharpened look you see so often from smartphones. The big new feature is improved HDR for backlit subjects, but the effect is minimal at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC8chD"&gt;That’s a whole pile of critical takes compared to phones that cost more than this phone. But despite the price difference, I think the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera should be held to as high a standard as possible — it’s a flagship phone. It can sometimes hang with the best of the best, and that’s a win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pLQs9q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10406554"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can put all your widgets in a drop-down menu instead of on your home screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vp8Inx-tnSjKoH9h7Te9rzY7t28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388878/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0052_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can put all your widgets in a drop-down menu instead of on your home screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZN4UWi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro performance and OxygenOS 11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iYZu5Q"&gt;Even though the camera is often the main differentiator for an Android phone, it’s not necessarily everybody’s highest priority. When I’m not pixel-peeping photos, the OnePlus 9 Pro is the best Android phone I’ve used so far this year. The performance is great. I’m especially impressed with the optical in-screen fingerprint sensor, which is super fast and doesn’t seem to be thrown by weird lighting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHyiSQ"&gt;OnePlus’ version of Android is called OxygenOS, and it’s now at version 11. The company has borrowed Samsung’s idea of shifting content down to meet your thumb and added in support for an always-on ambient display. The animations feel smooth, and OnePlus has learned its lesson about how annoying it can be to have apps close in the background too often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bWqNDM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus has a more elegant version of Android than Samsung&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOb2Eg"&gt;OnePlus has committed to two major OS updates and three years of bimonthly security updates, which puts it ahead of brands like LG but behind Samsung and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpxgUZ"&gt;You can customize a few things like the font and icons, too. My favorite customization is an ambient display mode that displays a colorful bar that shows how often you’ve been using your phone throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXAAvg"&gt;One feature borrowed from Apple and / or Microsoft is the ability to put your widgets into a separate panel so they’re not littering your main home screen, accessible via a quick swipe down. I love it, but I wish it wasn’t mapped to the same thing other Android phones use to quickly bring down notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIRq8d"&gt;Mostly, though, OxygenOS just feels &lt;em&gt;chill&lt;/em&gt;, especially compared to Samsung. OnePlus isn’t pushing its own ecosystem of apps and services (though with a new OnePlus Watch coming, perhaps that may change). It’s also not festooning its own apps with advertisements, unlike Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="waqTIv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10406439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cetFjAfrRKtYErNsip_4ScK7t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388898/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 (right) has a slightly smaller screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p8uB5Z"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is not a “flagship killer.” It’s a flagship. Although it still costs a little less than its top-tier competitors, it nevertheless is a pricey phone that makes a lot of promises. Mostly, it delivers on them. Even though a tiny fraction of customers buy OnePlus phones compared to Apple and Samsung, the company has built a track record long enough to deserve its status as an established brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GhSKH3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The regular OnePlus 9 is a fine choice for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NA5uRY"&gt;If you’re considering one of the new OnePlus phones, I am actually hard-pressed to make the case for the OnePlus 9 Pro over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;regular OnePlus 9, which Allison Johnson reviewed.&lt;/a&gt; The regular OnePlus 9 is $240 less, and the things you lose are mostly the nice-to-haves that justify the Pro’s existence: fast wireless charging, OIS, a telephoto lens, mmWave 5G, and the slightly larger screen. The cheaper OnePlus 9 lacks telephoto, but its other cameras take photos that are nearly equivalent to the pro. It has a high refresh rate screen, fast wired charging, wireless charging (though it’s not as fast), and most importantly, a nice OnePlus software experience with great performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mMX9ur"&gt;The reason to opt for the 9 Pro over the regular 9 is in some ways the same reason you’d opt for a OnePlus phone over a Samsung phone in the first place: it’s just a little nicer and a little different than what everybody else has in their pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XT0FQI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
