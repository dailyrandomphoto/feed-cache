    <title>Samsung’s Note 20 5G and Z Flip 5G now available in festive red and white colors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRHC-03CCHRoQpmQd1mItgTrW7w=/0x0:3900x2600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67998491/GalaxyNote20_Back_Pen_Red.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Note 20 5G (left) is getting a new red color, while the Z Flip 5G (right) will be sold in white.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UO1f34"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 5G and Z Flip 5G are available in a pair of new colors in the US starting today, the company has announced. The Note 20 5G is now available in red, while the Z Flip 5G is available in white. Both colors are being produced in “limited quantities,” Samsung says, and there’s no difference in specs or pricing between these and the original models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIPiSo"&gt;For those keeping track, these are the fourth and third colors for the Note 20 5G and the Z Flip 5G, respectively. The Note 20 5G is &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-note20/specs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available&lt;/a&gt; in copper, green, and gray, while the Z Flip 5G &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-z-flip/specs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; in copper and gray. Although they’re not getting the new colors, the Ultra version of the Note 20 is also available in white and black, while the 4G version of the Z Flip comes in black, purple, and gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The red Note 20 5G comes with a red S Pen, of course.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mCZ5zOsnnSZLfEqShfaQtQEy_jE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22071831/GalaxyZFlip5G_ClosedFront_Mystic_White.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, still folds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ds0AoF"&gt;The new Note 20 color has been announced as rumors continue to swirl that the range might be discontinued next year. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/16/galaxy-note-21-dead-foldables-report/"&gt;A few respected leakers have indicated&lt;/a&gt; that next year might not see the release of a new Note lineup, and last week a report from South Korean outlet &lt;a href="https://www.ajunews.com/view/20201122092719480"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AjuNews&lt;/em&gt; claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung plans to discontinue the range. Don’t worry if you’re a fan of the Note’s S Pen, though. Reports suggest that Samsung plans to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;add support for the stylus&lt;/a&gt; to the successor to the Galaxy S20 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="823VA0"&gt;The new colors for the Note 20 5G and Z Flip 5G are available to order from Samsung’s online store starting today, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSocVx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The $129 Poco M3 is Xiaomi’s latest budget big battery king</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sbj71e6sdoQcBz9twzu1e0m4_rQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67979600/DSCF7453.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gHJBqz"&gt;Xiaomi’s Poco sub-brand has &lt;a href="https://blog.poco.net/en/?p=135"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its latest entry-level phone, the Poco M3. As with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21426866/xiaomi-poco-x3-nfc-hands-on-price-specs-release"&gt;most other Poco phones&lt;/a&gt;, the M3 has an strong spec sheet for its comparatively low price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1V3r7"&gt;The Poco M3 has a 6.53-inch 1080p LCD screen with a waterdrop notch for the 8-megapixel selfie camera. The display is pretty basic: the chin at the bottom is quite big, the fingerprint sensor is integrated into the power button on the side rather than the screen, and the panel is only 60Hz, but it’s sharp enough and perfectly serviceable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeHdsW"&gt;The phone’s design certainly stands out from behind, with a large glossy camera bump emblazoned with a bright white “POCO” logo. The main camera is 48 megapixels, but the other two cameras are just 2-megapixel sensors for depth and macro, so this isn’t really a meaningful triple-camera setup. While the phone’s chassis is constructed out of plastic, it uses a leather-ish finish that feels much nicer to the touch than most other plastic phones.   It’s available in black, yellow, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g1_ti_3q0TTLPsa4B77Je_5kpRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22120890/DSCF7449.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tkrGbN"&gt;The M3’s processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 662, which is paired with 4GB of RAM. It runs MIUI 12 atop Android 10. The battery is an impressive 6,000mAh, and the phone is a hefty but fairly manageable 9.6mm thick and 198g in weight. There are options for 64GB or 128GB of storage, and the phone has two SIM card slots in addition to a separate microSD slot. There’s also a headphone jack as well as a USB-C port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEbsSA"&gt;Xiaomi is putting the Poco M3 on sale online on Black Friday, November 27th, with early US pricing starting at $129 for the 64GB model and $149 for 128GB. The regular price is $149 for 64GB and $169 for 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yxf84F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Budget roundup: the latest low-cost iPhones and Android phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21526773/budget-phones-cheap-iphones-android-low-cost"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4pqoQE"&gt;Even at those higher prices, the M3 looks like it’ll be very good value by US market standards. You could compare it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286687/motorola-moto-e-2020-g-fast-review-price-specs-features"&gt;this year’s Moto E&lt;/a&gt;, for example, which starts at the same $149 price point but has a 720p screen, a Snapdragon 632 processor, a Micro USB port, 32GB of storage, and just 2GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces the A12 and A02S, two new entry-level phones for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFMBQuW6lVMM-ijuRRaJ8ZeWRJE=/11x50:817x587/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67941602/galaxya12_galaxya02s.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gIhUJB"&gt;Samsung on Tuesday announced the Galaxy A12 and A02S, two new entry-level phones set to launch next year in Europe. Both offer a lower barrier to entry for anyone looking for a modern Android smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr4Egu"&gt;The A12 is designed to be a successor to the A11, sporting a 6.5-inch HD+ display with a notch for the 8-megapixel front-facing camera, an octa-core processor, a fingerprint sensor on the side, and a 5,000mAh battery. Photos are covered by a quad-array of cameras on the back, including a 48-megapixel main sensor, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, and a pair of 2-megapixel sensors to help out with macro and depth shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cmHxdu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9670224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ToGBaR"&gt;The A02S is slightly less impressive: it has the same display and battery but with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage (though you can expand storage with its microSD slot). The phone is also saddled with different cameras: a 13-megapixel main sensor and the same pair of 2-megapixel sensors as the A12. Costs are also cut with ports, the A02S features an older Micro USB port as opposed to the USB-C port you may have wanted. The A02S is also missing a fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hkjf79"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9670233"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PCHH0j"&gt;Samsung recently rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21212085/samsung-galaxy-a01-a11-a21-a51-a71-5g-mid-range-android-price-release-date"&gt;5G versions of its Galaxy A line&lt;/a&gt; of phones; we covered the Galaxy A51 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;more fully in our review&lt;/a&gt;. We thought that model favored screen quality over cameras and speed — expect potentially greater trade-offs with the A12 and A02S’s even lower prices. Regardless, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/worlds-third-best-selling-galaxy-smartphone-q3-2020/"&gt;Samsung’s budget options are its bestselling phones&lt;/a&gt;, so even minor improvements to specs seem like a good move for anyone in Europe looking for their first smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ay7Izv"&gt;The A12 is currently set to start at €179 ($212) for 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM, with 128GB and 6GB of RAM on the high end for €199 ($236). The A02S starts at €150 ($178). The A12 will be available in January 2021 and the A02S in February 2021. There are currently no announced plans for a North American release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdpgOK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said the A12 and A02S had 6.8 inch displays, the displays are actually 6.5 inches. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook tweaked the News Feed to highlight more mainstream news sources after the election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KUdPu3nCCcZUP4dnWaTxkVABxw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67871354/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6x25Yo"&gt;Facebook, in the days after the US election, decided that an uptick in viral misinformation related to election results and President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede needed an extreme measure to be dealt with. So the company made a temporary change to its News Feed algorithm to favor mainstream news outlets, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/facebook-election-misinformation.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKHjhm"&gt;Facebook specifically tweaked how much weight the News Feed gives to “news ecosystem quality” scores, an internet metric designed to quantify the trustworthiness and quality of a news source. That way, users of Facebook would see more news from publishers like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, CNN, and NPR and less of the hyper-partisan pages that tend to peddle in inflammatory and sometimes downright false or misleading content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LKOBnP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook tweaked the News Feed to favor mainstream news publishers in the days after Election Day&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eIwQFC"&gt;Many of those publishers with poor news ecosystem quality scores happen to be right-wing sites, and many of those right-wing sites have been spreading Trump’s false claims and countless other misleading and dubious election fraud and conspiracy theory stories far and wide on the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvlJ7k"&gt;“There are many variables at play in every product decision we make, all aimed at creating the best possible experience for people,” Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne said in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The assertions in this report are based on sources who have no product decision-making authority and are advancing their own narrow impression of how our process works.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHZjgS"&gt;The company had been signaling for months that it was preparing for worst-case scenarios like what eventually unfolded when President-elect Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election earlier this month, but Trump to this day continues to try to undermine and overturn the results. Facebook described these scenarios and its tools for combating them as “break glass” plans, according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPN0WS"&gt;One of those plans involved manually tweaking the News Feed. CEO Mark Zuckerberg ultimately authorized the change when presented with findings that right-wing news publishers were seeing huge swells in engagement from unverified stories about election fraud and how Democrats were trying to steal the election from Trump, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDiXi"&gt;Facebook employees are now asking company leadership whether the changes could stay in place to help promote a healthier and less divisive news ecosystem on the social media network. But executives like News Feed chief John Hegeman tell &lt;em&gt;The Times &lt;/em&gt;that there are no plans to implement any election-related tweaks as permanent changes to the platform. Rather, Facebook plans to study the experiments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHmMp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 24th, 1:14PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Facebook. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends deadline for requiring in-app purchases for apps selling online classes and events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/41Td2Civs3RZATncjC73iWzRr-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866441/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sls9lL"&gt;Apple on Monday announced &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=kw16tplo"&gt;an extension to its deadline&lt;/a&gt; for requiring in-app purchases for online events and classes offered within iOS apps to June 30th, 2021. Apple previously adjusted what types of events are subject to its in-app purchase policy and standard 30 percent cut back in September, with the original intention of requiring in-app purchases in all appropriate apps by December of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOgA4k"&gt;Apple cited the coronavirus pandemic, writing in a developer update posted to its website, “As the world fights COVID-19, we recognize that adapting experiences from in-person to digital continues to be a top priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y0dPqy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This deadline extension means developers have more time to temporarily reap the full profits of their sales&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XVXsTi"&gt;Requiring in-app purchase options for outside services like video streaming and exercise classes offered through iOS has been part of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business"&gt;the company’s policy&lt;/a&gt; for quite a while, but this specific change is focused on the adjustments made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455598/facebook-paid-events-apple-ios-30-percent-fees-waived"&gt;following Facebook’s September complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s issue was framed around event organizers losing out on much-needed money for their digital events offered through the Facebook app during COVID-19, because of Apple’s 30 percent in-app purchase commission. Apple decided to waive the fee till the end of the year, and the company adjusted its policy to focus on group events and classes to keep one-on-one experiences free from Apple fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vcUBs"&gt;This deadline extension means developers have more time to incorporate in-app purchases in their apps where applicable and to temporarily reap the full profits of their sales. Apple’s other recent App Store changes suggest it’s inclined to make some concessions, whether because of pressure from developers or regulatory scrutiny from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;on-going legal battle with Epic&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;anti-trust investigation in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLdR73"&gt;The best example is Apple’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;. Any developer making under $1 million in sales per year will be able to apply next year and if approved receive a reduced 15 percent App Store commission. Other companies like Amazon have negotiated such exemptions, albeit in back room deals rather than public battles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;Amazon Prime Video is able to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; with a reduced 15 percent Apple commission and sell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;in-app purchases and rentals&lt;/a&gt; without being forced to use Apple’s in-app purchase option. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="QKBZD5"&gt;T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2020/T-Mobiles-Got-Serious-Holideals-for-All/default.aspx"&gt;adding 33 channels&lt;/a&gt; from its $10-per-month TVision Vibe service for free to all of its pricier TVision Live plans as it deals with &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/t-mobile-tvision-channels-programmers-deals-disputes/"&gt;ongoing complaints&lt;/a&gt; from cable companies like Discovery over how it offers channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dl0Smh"&gt;“Current TVision Live customers and anyone who signs up for a TVision Live service package gets an additional 30+ top-rated entertainment channels from TVision Vibe included,” the press release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SO6Cuh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/t-mobile-tvision-revising-bundles-programmer-complaints-1234830369/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile’s press release frames the newly added channels as a holiday deal, but the reality is likely a little bit more complicated: it’s a temporary solution as T-Mobile works to deal with issues raised by its cheaper $10-per-month Vibe plan, which offers channels from AMC, Discovery, and Viacom at a dramatically lower cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYPTGk"&gt;According to an &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/t-mobile-tvision-channel-additions-programming-dispute-1234836655/"&gt;earlier report from &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the issue is centered on the fact that T-Mobile’s contract with those content providers dictates that channels offered in cheaper tiers (like Vibe) have to be included in more premium tiers, too. Splitting up everything into separate packages, like T-Mobile had originally done — as nice of a benefit as it might be for consumers — appears to be against those contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3T6llC"&gt;For now, T-Mobile is solving that issue by including the AMC, Discovery, and Viacom channels in the pricer Live plans (which cost between $40 to $60 per month, depending on which version a customer chooses). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuZFAz"&gt;But it’s hard to imagine that it’ll be a viable long-term solution, given that T-Mobile will have to pay for providing those channels to all of those new customers. And unless the company is willing to just take the loss on that indefinitely, it’s likely that it’ll either have to rejigger its plans entirely or be forced to raise prices (much as competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; have had to do this year). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music adds behind-the-scenes trivia for songs with new X-Ray features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-b9YC8SgFxb42_S8bsVt5gMfVs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67827842/image001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agdnUV"&gt;Amazon is adding new X-Ray features to its music streaming service, which let you see extra pieces of trivia about the music you’re listening to. The feature is available globally across “tens of millions” of songs, and Amazon says there are extra “fun facts” available for popular songs in the US and UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYqFds"&gt;X-Ray isn’t an entirely new feature for Amazon. It’s already available on the company’s Prime Video streaming service where it shows information like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/13/8399933/amazon-launches-x-ray-fire-tv"&gt;which actors are in a current scene&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s previously been able to show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/12/5802810/amazon-prime-music-hands-on"&gt;real-time lyrics for songs in Amazon Music&lt;/a&gt;. What’s new are the additional pieces of trivia the feature now shows about tracks. These range from interesting tidbits about an artist’s backstory to more perfunctory information about when a song was released and the spot it reached on the &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOoSsV"&gt;To access the trivia on compatible songs, you can swipe up on the “X-Ray” icon. From there, you can swipe through each fact or tap on the “Credits” section at the bottom of the screen to see a track’s complete credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxCjCx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 20th, 2:39PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This post originally stated, based on information provided by Amazon, that X-Ray is only available in the US and UK. This is incorrect. It is actually available globally, but select songs in the US and UK will have extra trivia attached to them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile becomes first carrier to enable 988 number for mental health services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8PxhVaGIDrDx0gZ4LjiYRt_3ahw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67827717/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;T-Mobile has added support for the 988 emergency mental health services number more than a year and a half ahead of the Federal Communications Commission’s deadline, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fcommunity%2Ft-mobile-makes-988-emergency-lifeline-available-to-customers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F20%2F21580432%2Ftmobile-988-number-fcc-mental-health-suicide-prevention#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. T-Mobile customers who dial 988 will be connected to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) and its network of crisis centers across the US. T-Mobile says it is the first carrier in the US to make 988 available to its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIenGN"&gt;T-Mobile chief technology officer Abdul Saad said in a statement that making the shorter emergency number available to customers was “a matter of urgency for us, particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the holiday season approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrMr20"&gt;In 2019, the &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-staff-recommends-3-digit-number-suicide-prevention-hotline"&gt;FCC released a report&lt;/a&gt; suggesting a three-digit hotline number would make it easier for those seeking help. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328600/national-suicide-prevention-lifeline-number-dial-988-fcc"&gt;FCC voted unanimously in July&lt;/a&gt; to make 988 the number to connect to the NSPL hotline, and it gave carriers until July 2022 to put it into effect. However, the 988 number isn’t able to receive text messages, which FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said at the time was problematic. She noted that voice service is “not native for most young people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgPwB6"&gt;People in need of mental health support can still contact the NSPL by calling 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK) or by using &lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/"&gt;online chats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrLYkr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Owc5DT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp update brings AR features for newer devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4P5H353dMvISgN7M2669bpkkOlQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67824063/ACPocketCamp_06_AR_Camera.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f1Z9pR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&lt;/em&gt;, the smartphone entry in the long-running Nintendo franchise, has been updated with a pair of new augmented reality features. The first, AR Camera, lets you place characters and furniture from the game in the real world and photograph them. Meanwhile, the AR Cabin feature lets players decorate a virtual cabin, fill it with characters, and then view it in augmented reality from their smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBIhN1"&gt;Along with the new AR modes, Nintendo says the update means more areas of each campsite can have furniture and items placed within them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYgErPz9ViGHqJVuAZNJp5Qq4QU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22055599/ACPocketCamp_01_AR_Cabin.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AR Cabin lets you assemble a virtual room and then explore it in augmented reality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ndfM3j"&gt;Unfortunately, the new features have increased the game’s system requirements, and previous versions of the game are &lt;a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_2010297"&gt;now unusable&lt;/a&gt; after the update. A &lt;a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_2011205"&gt;support post&lt;/a&gt; notes that iPhone users now require iOS version 11 at a minimum (or ideally iOS 13 and above) rather than iOS 9, which was the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201109034304if_/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp/id1179915619"&gt;previous requirement&lt;/a&gt;. Android users, meanwhile, now need to be running Android 5 or above on a 64-bit device with at least 1.5GB of RAM. That’s up from the previous requirement of &lt;a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_1111252"&gt;Android version 4.4 and 1.5GB of RAM&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weG3Xa"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_2011205"&gt;same support document&lt;/a&gt;, “Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp cannot be downloaded or played on devices that are no longer supported.” The change has left some players furious. The replies to the official &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pocket_Camp/status/1329673400189587456"&gt;Pocket Camp Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; are littered with complaints from players who can no longer access the game after the update. A particular problem appears to be the requirement for a 64-bit Android device, with some players reporting that they’re &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/philippawarr/status/1329778787563794433"&gt;unable to run the game on their 64-bit hardware&lt;/a&gt; because of a 32-bit operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2lhyfWZpWJ-fGJ1VKrPbCpQqigc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22055601/ACPocketCamp_05_AR_Camera.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While AR Camera lets you place objects and characters from the game in the real world. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8tccP1"&gt;“In certain cases, some devices may not be supported even when they meet the conditions listed,” a &lt;a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_2010297"&gt;support post&lt;/a&gt; about the update from last month read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KajpNw"&gt;Nintendo says that save data can be transferred to a new device if players have already linked their Nintendo Accounts with their game. When setting up a new device, you’ll need to select the “Link Nintendo Account” option when starting the game for the first time, which will let you import the existing save data. Note that Leaf Tickets, an in-game currency that can be purchased with real money, cannot be transferred between Android and iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBY1Pg"&gt;Coinciding with the update, Nintendo is offering a free month of the “Furniture &amp;amp; Fashion Plan,” which offers benefits like expanded storage for items and the chance to get exclusive furniture and clothing. The subscription normally costs $7.99 (£7.99 / €8.99) a month. On the flip side, if you’re one of those players who no longer has a device that can play the game, Nintendo advises that you’ll need to cancel any in-game subscriptions to prevent future charges. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia is coming to iOS officially as a web app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuaYe7wZW2ORF0ULGyeFt0RXTbI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67817574/akrales_191113_3779_0319.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZY8pmW"&gt;Google on Thursday announced iOS support for its Stadia cloud gaming service, following in the footsteps of Microsoft in turning to the mobile web to circumvent Apple’s App Store restrictions. Google says it has been building a progressive web app version of Stadia that will run in the mobile version of Apple’s Safari browser, similar to how Microsoft intends to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508706/microsoft-xcloud-ios-web-browser-2021"&gt;deliver its competing xCloud service on iOS&lt;/a&gt; sometime next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHLBll"&gt;But Google intends to beat Microsoft to the punch with public testing of its version in the coming weeks. Nvidia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;also announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it a beta web app version of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service on iOS is available today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qucZ0h"&gt;Apple in late August &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;clarified its rules around cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;, telling providers like Google and Microsoft that their apps were not allowed on the App Store due to restrictions Apple imposes on software that streams games to the iPhone and iPad. Apple eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;loosened its restrictions&lt;/a&gt; after public criticism from Microsoft and others, but the App Store still requires companies to submit individual games for App Store review. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;called the compromise a “bad experience for consumers”&lt;/a&gt; before deciding it would develop a web app version of xCloud for iOS instead. Now, Google is doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mw2qzi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s web app version of its cloud gaming service will arrive before Microsoft’s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Ep28U"&gt;The iOS testing announcement coincides with Stadia’s one-year anniversary of its public launch last fall. Google also announced today that its first slate of free-to-play games would be coming to Stadia, following the reveal earlier this week that the base version of Bungie’s &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; would no longer require a $10 per month Stadia Pro subscription and can now be played by anyone with a Google account that signs up for Stadia. And State Share, the streamer-friendly Stadia feature that allows players to share their exact point in a game with viewers or followers on social media, will be launching next January with the release of IO Interactive’s &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmiicV"&gt;Google is also using its one-year anniversary as an opportunity to tout fresh Stadia statistics. The company won’t yet reveal how many people have signed up for Stadia or subscribed to its Pro service. But the company says it’s introduced more than 80 games in the last 12 months to the platform, with plans to support more than 135 titles by the end of the year. It’s also added more than 100 new features to the platform in the last 12 months, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21546194/google-stadia-family-sharing-digital-games-purchase-share"&gt;family sharing for the first time earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALpQZV"&gt;That library also includes more than 50 Stadia Pro games that have been made available for free since the service’s launch, with more than 30 active titles available as of this month. (Some games are added to Stadia Pro for a limited time before they are removed, similar to limited giveaways of games as part of Sony’s PlayStation Plus and Microsoft’s Xbox Live Gold subscriptions.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fQFAB"&gt;To celebrate the upcoming launch of CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, Google is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;running a rather excellent promotion&lt;/a&gt;: preordering the game before December 10th or buying the released version before December 17th will get you a Stadia Premiere Edition bundle, which includes the Stadia controller and a Chromecast Ultra for streaming Stadia to a television. The promotion is just while supplies last, though, and Google isn’t saying how many units it will be giving out. So it’s perhaps a good idea to preorder early if you’re interested in making Stadia the platform you use to play &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntl0yW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
