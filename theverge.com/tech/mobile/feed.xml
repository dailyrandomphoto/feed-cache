    <title>TCL’s budget 20S and 20SE phones beat expectations</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Big phones with small price tags&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QTp9Ss"&gt;If the TCL 20S and 20SE phones were on &lt;em&gt;The Price Is Right&lt;/em&gt;, you would probably guess much higher prices than their retail ones. With the 20S retailing for $250 and the 20SE going for $190, these sub-$300 4G phones are the real deal. They check all the boxes for what you’d want in a smartphone: they have big and bright screens, large 5,000mAh batteries, 128GB of internal storage, and “good enough” cameras. You even get a free clear silicone case inside each box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqCcrM"&gt;TCL certainly knows a thing or two about manufacturing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;budget 4K Smart TVs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493125/tcl-alto-soundbar-9-plus-8i-6-plus-3-bluetooth-airplay-google-assistant-dolby-atmos-surround-sound"&gt;affordable soundbars&lt;/a&gt;, and many other gadgets. Heck, it was already quietly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120107/tcl-blackberry-ends-phone-global-rights-date-2020"&gt;producing phones for the likes of BlackBerry, Alcatel, and Palm&lt;/a&gt; before starting its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21049747/tcl-10-pro-10l-5g-phones-brand-folding-prototype-ces-2020"&gt;eponymous line in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Now it’s taking those skills building other accessibly priced gadgets to its phone line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="da4rRU"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22560849/tcl-20-pro-5g-review-screen-battery-price-specs"&gt;the fancier TCL 20 Pro 5G&lt;/a&gt;, neither the 20S nor the 20SE has the latest and greatest processor, nor do they support 5G networking — those aren’t unsurprising omissions at these price points. But given TCL’s history, it’s no wonder the real stars of the TCL 20S and 20SE are their brilliant displays — though they each use different panels. Both phones look and feel more luxurious than they are because of their solid build quality, as well as attention to the details users really actually care about: long-lasting battery life, strong performance, ample storage, as well as ingenious design. Who says good things can’t come in budget-friendly packages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="AjyYRY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10805445"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wvub5R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10805028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8TsFX1"&gt;The $190 20SE has a 6.82-inch display, which, at 720 pixels wide, is too low-resolution for a screen this large (720 x 1640 pixels; aspect ratio 20.5:9). I tried watching the 4K Dune trailer on YouTube, and it looked too dim and fuzzy at 720p for me to enjoy the video. Nevertheless, this display offers vibrant colors even at 50 percent brightness, whether or not you turn on the NXTVISION display optimization software (I did not see much difference either way). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qu6nF"&gt;The higher-priced 20S has a brighter yet slightly smaller 6.67-inch screen, with a higher-resolution FHD+ LCD display than the 20SE (1080 x 2400 pixels with 20:9 aspect ratio). When I watched the same Dune trailer at 1080p on the 20S, I could actually see sharper lines and more details this time around. Both displays look bright enough outdoors that I can read text if I boost the screen to 100 percent brightness. I also appreciate how unobtrusive the pinhole front camera is on the 20S compared to the 20SE’s tear-drop design, the latter of which actually cuts into the top of the display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6H0ZSg1qQQL_QOlehzk-1_D9ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911279/gsin_190125_4797_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the TCL 20S and 20SE have relatively bright displays with vibrant colors, thanks to TCL’s television know-how.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ORMeyW"&gt;Of the two models, the 20S is slightly more manageable to use. But it’s still a big enough phone that I need two hands to use it safely. It can be a bit of a reach for my fingers to navigate different parts of the screen and hold it in the same hand, so I need my other hand to balance the device. At 0.23 inches (5.84mm) taller and 0.25oz (7.1g) heavier, the 20SE is physically bigger than the 20S, but its technical components are not in the same weight class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bhqb2d"&gt;With a price that is $60 less than the 20S, TCL had to find savings in the $190 20SE anywhere it could. For one thing, the 20SE uses the lower-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 chipset, whose slower processing speed can’t make up ground with 4GB of RAM. The 20S, on the other hand, is powered by the faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and is also supported by 4GB of RAM. The difference between the two isn’t very noticeable in basic texting and social media doomscrolling, but I would occasionally have to open an app or webpage twice on the 20SE because it wouldn’t load the first time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y23HLKFT4D2eX5y-WPCxRJk6IUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911281/gsin_190125_4797_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20SE’s 13-megapixel front camera and tear-drop design cuts into its display, but you don’t notice it after awhile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DaAVol"&gt;To see what these devices are capable of, I played a couple rounds of Pokemon Unite to see how they’d fare. Both TCL phones took about as long to load the game, whereas the OnePlus 9 Pro (with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip) loaded the same round in about half the time. Since the 20SE has a lesser quality display and processor, I was not surprised that my Pikachu moved with a bit of lag. It was only slightly more responsive on the 20S, however. The 20SE’s dual speakers are also louder and buzzier than the 20S speakers, which sounded quieter but produced a more nuanced sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTbqi4"&gt;Despite their differences, both devices offer plenty of internal storage at 128GB and give you the option to expand that storage via microSD. The 20S’ microSD slot accepts up to a 1TB card, while the 20SE only supports up to a 256GB card. Both phones run Android 11 out of the box, with a TCL skin called TCL UI. Since the 20S will get one major OS update (TCL won’t commit to the same for the 20SE) and both phones will get two years of security updates, you’ll have ample room to install these upgrades and stash your content for the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTtJ7csyZMadmbrhuKLkxFMI55E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911285/gsin_190126_4797_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20S’ integrated fingerprint sensor in the power button was a delight to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbu5lC"&gt;The fingerprint sensors on the 20S and 20SE deserve a special mention as they’re quick to recognize my fingerprint and unlock the phones. I especially love the fingerprint sensor that is built into the 20S’ power button, located on the right side of the phone. With just one touch, you not only wake up your phone but also unlock it in an elegant and intuitive way. The 20SE has a more traditional round fingerprint sensor on the back of the device that works just as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6Zl0Q"&gt;Facial recognition on the 20SE can be rather useless. It either doesn’t recognize my face or asks me to touch an icon on the lock screen so that I can unlock the phone with my face, which entirely defeats the purpose of using a hands-free method to unlock. (Thankfully, you can disable this “feature.”) Facial recognition simply worked more consistently on the 20S than on the 20SE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvglcj"&gt;Both phones include a 3.5mm audio jack on top, volume rocker on the right side, non-customizable Google Assistant button on the left, plus a USB-C port and a pair of bottom-firing dual speakers. The 20S has an understated back that looks curved from various angles, but the layer of “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ actually makes the back cover really fingerprint-resistant. The 20SE’s back cover is the complete opposite: it’s a fingerprint disaster zone, thanks to its shiny, nano-photoetched back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfWDPMO5nGAdmxi2MR5kDvnP_1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911288/gsin_190126_4797_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both TCL 20S and 20SE include a free clear silicone case inside each box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2FSO2"&gt;With a 5,000mAH battery inside both phones, it was a challenge to use up that much power on deadline without doing anything out of the ordinary. My normal phone diet includes: checking my two email accounts, texting on WhatsApp and Google Hangouts, tweeting on Twitter, visiting my usual slate of websites like Reddit, as well as listening to a podcast or two. Due to the pandemic, I was home during my testing but tried to use a mix of Wi-Fi and 4G service to mimic real-world use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40nTeP"&gt;I actually got results that are close to TCL’s claims. I used the 20S for about 31 hours on one charge (TCL suggested 36 hours on 3G/4G) and took around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device, which is hardly a “fast charge” as claimed by TCL’s product sheet. Similarly, the 20SE lasted around 32 hours on one charge, compared to TCL’s estimate of 31 hours of use on 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a33xGW"&gt;Don’t get too excited about the cameras on the 20S or the 20SE, though: they can take great snaps in natural light, but I wouldn’t hang these photos on my wall. Both phones have a quad-camera setup, but each model uses different sensors. While the 20S has a 64-megapixel main and a 15-megapixel front camera, and the 20SE has a 48-megapixel main and 13-megapixel front camera, these numbers don’t really say anything about the quality of their photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZeUT9L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10802883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDsaah"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the TCL 20S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTOxVs"&gt;I snapped a bunch of wide-angle and main camera shots (of the same area) using both phones. The ones from the 20S look more balanced with plenty of details, compared to the ones from the 20SE, where the water fountain area looks more over-exposed, especially at 4x cropped zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVI7ry"&gt;There’s a noticeable difference in color between the photos captured with the main cameras and the ultrawide angle cameras on both phones (8-megapixel on the 20S; 5-megapixel on the 20SE). There is also a problem with the Super Macro mode on both phones’ 2-megapixel macro cameras. Photos of the fuchsia flower look pixelated and flat, while the colors from the indoor photos of the blue hydrangea look way over-saturated in the yellow channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5newt"&gt;Based on the price point of these phones, I was surprised when any of the night shots came out somewhat presentable (I know they’re in varying degrees of blurriness). To be fair, even the photos from my Pixel 5 weren’t perfect. Both the 20S and 20SE struggled to focus with so many different light sources in the dark, and each photo required many awkward seconds to process. The 20S produced the sharper photo, while the 20SE’s photos look much less detailed, especially if you look at the lights from the office towers in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nn5y2T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10802941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9fTXeF"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the TCL 20SE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDTYKb"&gt;At first glance, both front-facing cameras captured decent selfies. But I have to give the edge to the 20S’ 16-megapixel camera for the more realistic colors and brighter photos. The selfie from the 20SE’s 13-megapixel front cam just looked more over-exposed: my sunglasses looked frosted, and my skin looked unnaturally pale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzmjQQKUh-mGOy2MMqKXfwEeRWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911280/gsin_190125_4797_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both TCL 20S and 20SE feel solid in-hand, with nice details like nano-photoetching and fingerprint-resistant crystal coating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TNF7iu"&gt;I can’t really think of a higher quality budget phone in the $250 range that can beat the TCL 20S. It’s got all the hallmarks of a more expensive device but with a more affordable price tag. Its vibrant 6.67-inch 1080p display doesn’t look out of place next to other flagship phones, and it feels luxurious with that fingerprint-proofed layer of “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z0mh1i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll be hard-pressed to find a better phone for $250 than the 20S&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvGFC9"&gt;Sure, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;$250 Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt; has an equally large battery and a slightly newer processor. In exchange, you get a meager 64GB of internal storage, which is a far cry from the 128GB plus microSD card slot that is offered by the 20S. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$269 OnePlus Nord 10&lt;/a&gt; (global GSM unlocked version) is also an option. It uses a newer Snapdragon chip that is 5G-compatible but still runs Android 10 when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; is ready to drop. If you don’t care about having a 5G-ready phone right now, then the TCL 20S makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gQL3S"&gt;If you’re looking for an unlocked phone that is compatible with Verizon and most 4G GSM networks like AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile, I don’t think you can go wrong with this unlocked TCL 20S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Us9CdG"&gt;If your budget is strictly sub-$200 and won’t be using Verizon as your carrier, then TCL 20SE is a smart choice. While the $180 OnePlus Nord N100 might save you $10, you’ll lose half the amount of internal storage for minimal savings (from 128GB on the TCL 20SE to 64GB on the N100) — that’s a terrible trade-off. You’ll be happier with a big bright screen, ample storage and battery life, as well as the ability to choose any GSM network (including AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile). If you don’t mind spending an extra $60, though, the 20S is worth the upgrade — your future self will thank you.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Visible confirms account breaches, blames ‘outside sources’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WCZPrRgPQ1Sq7t_GHPUEAtQEi8c=/0x25:1336x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69989709/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_9.41.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Visible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CCertt"&gt;Cell service provider Visible has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723587/verizon-visible-cell-network-potential-hack-data-breach-phone-sales"&gt;customer reports&lt;/a&gt; of attackers accessing and changing user accounts, and it has said that the breaches were carried out using usernames and passwords from “outside sources.” In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; (which you can read in full below), the Verizon-owned carrier said that it’s worked to “mitigate the issue” since it became aware of it, though it doesn’t mention exactly what measures it’s put in place to protect customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lp7Iz8"&gt;Starting earlier this week, customers of Verizon’s lower-cost service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723587/verizon-visible-cell-network-potential-hack-data-breach-phone-sales"&gt;were reporting unauthorized charges&lt;/a&gt; from Visible on their PayPals or credit card statements, as well as emails telling them that their accounts’ passwords or addresses had been changed. Some customers have been frustrated with a lack of response from the company, as it hasn’t sent out emails or texts about the situation and was largely silent on social media until Wednesday, when it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Visible/status/1448322446646554633?s=20"&gt;posted a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5oHfGB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; If you use your Visible username &amp;amp; password across multiple accounts, including your bank/financial accounts, we recommend updating your username/password with those services. Reminder: Visible will never call &amp;amp; ask for your password, secret questions or account PINs. &lt;/p&gt;— Visible (@Visible) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Visible/status/1448322446646554633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jXgEea"&gt;In both its statement and on Twitter, the company recommends resetting your password if it’s one you’ve used for other services. It’s good advice, but the company has turned off its password reset system — it wasn’t available yesterday, and as of Wednesday morning you’ll still get an error if you try to change your password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVp1tn"&gt;Hackers getting into accounts using passwords found elsewhere is very common, that’s why everybody (including Visible) says to use unique passwords for each service and to change your passwords in the case of a breach. Security experts also recommend using two-factor authentication, which can help protect you even if your password fails (like in a situation where you’re not able to change it). Visible, however, doesn’t support two-factor authentication, which means that its customers are still potentially open to these kinds of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2KJYg"&gt;Here’s Visible’s full statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zaaqzD"&gt;Visible is aware of an issue in which some member accounts were accessed and/or charged without their authorization. As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we immediately initiated a review and started deploying tools to mitigate the issue and enable additional controls to further protect our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lE5BM"&gt;Our investigation indicates that threat actors were able to access username/passwords from outside sources, and exploit that information to login to Visible accounts. If you use your Visible username and password across multiple accounts, including your bank or other financial accounts, we recommend updating your username/password with those services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mI9x16"&gt;Protecting customer information — including securing customer accounts — is critically important to our company and our customers. As a reminder, our company will never call and ask for your password, secret questions or account PINs. If you feel your account has been compromised, please reach out to us via chat at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvisible.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22724592%2Fvisible-account-breach-cell-purchases-outside-sources-passwords" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;visible.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="9TPtp3"&gt;Realme has launched its latest flagship phone for India, the GT Neo 2. It’s similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534618/realme-gt-hands-on-europe-launch-price-specs"&gt;the impressive Realme GT&lt;/a&gt; that came to Europe a few months ago — this one is better in some ways but worse in others. Depending on your taste, you’ll probably feel quite strongly about which bucket the neon green version pictured above falls into. (It also comes in black and blue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeSjvR"&gt;While the GT has a Snapdragon 888 processor, the GT Neo 2 is built around an 870. This is basically Qualcomm’s speed-bumped version of the 865 Plus, which was itself a faster version of last year’s flagship chip — the main core now runs at 3.2GHz. Realme says the GT Neo 2’s new vapor cooling system is 30 percent larger and 20 percent more efficient, making use of stainless steel as well as copper. The phone does include 5G connectivity, though 5G networks haven’t yet been switched on in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpIDHT"&gt;The display is a little bigger than the GT’s, measuring in at 6.62 inches. It’s a 1080p OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. The battery is also bigger than the GT’s at 5,000mAh, up from 4,500mAh, and the GT Neo 2 still has Realme’s 65W SuperDart fast charging. Realme says it should take 36 minutes to fill from 0 to 100 percent. There’s still no wireless charging, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633722/realme-flash-magdart-magnetic-wireless-charging-time-test"&gt;the new magnetic MagDart system&lt;/a&gt; that is so far yet to be included on any commercial device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-3WNa8ZoP38yeyR9-QOKV_Bvo0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923288/IMG_0171.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n7DWcE"&gt;Like the GT, the triple camera system includes a 64-megapixel main sensor, an 8-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 2-megapixel macro lens. Realme is pushing the GT Neo 2’s Street Photography mode, which is supposed to boost shutter response and focus performance, as well as including some film simulation filters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QB7Ezh"&gt;The Realme GT Neo 2 will be available later this week in India. It costs Rs. 31,999 (~$425) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or you can get a 12GB/256GB version for Rs. 35,999 (~$475).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some of Verizon’s Visible cell network customers say they’ve been hacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYy2soK3rXiuStajsstFeIuJ5qg=/331x0:1081x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987158/1500x500.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Visible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8JPEpQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 1:10PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Visible has confirmed that some accounts were accessed without authorization. Read more in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724592/visible-account-breach-cell-purchases-outside-sources-passwords"&gt;&lt;em&gt;our follow-up article&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Our original story follows below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQCSra"&gt;Some customers of Verizon’s Visible service are using social media to say that hackers have accessed their accounts, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q6y73u/im_seriously_disappointed_with_visible_today/"&gt;changed their information&lt;/a&gt; to lock them out, and in some cases &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q6o4q4/yes_i_was_hacked_as_well_im_making_this_as_public/"&gt;even ordered phones&lt;/a&gt; using their payment info (&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/verizon-owned-visible-network-suffers-suspected-data-breach/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re not familiar, Visible is a cell service &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/what-visible" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;owned and operated by Verizon&lt;/a&gt; that pitches itself as a less expensive, “all-digital” network, meaning there aren’t any physical stores like you’d get with a traditional carrier. Starting on Monday, customers on both Twitter and Reddit reported en masse that they’d been getting emails from the company about changed passwords and addresses, and that they’ve &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dao0815/status/1448026781332623360?s=20"&gt;had difficulties contacting the company’s chat support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYw5nt"&gt;Visible’s customer service account on Twitter seemingly hasn’t addressed the issue, besides &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/visiblecare/status/1448040220318961665?s=20"&gt;directing upset customers to its DMs&lt;/a&gt;. A user marked as a Visible employee on the subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q65cdl/security_update/"&gt;posted a statement on Monday&lt;/a&gt; afternoon, saying that a “small number” of accounts were affected, but that the company didn’t believe its systems had been breached. The statement did recommend that users change their passwords, but as many commenters pointed out (and as I can confirm), the password reset system currently isn’t working. Verizon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yX8ZQb"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2021-10-13T01:13:44.362093+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q65cdl/security_update/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;Security Update&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/"&gt;Visible&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D0Ho6e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I haven’t received any emails or texts from the company about the situation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9aXBLc"&gt;I’m a Visible customer myself (I switched from T-Mobile for reasons unrelated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;its recent massive data breach&lt;/a&gt;, but am &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; thrilled to possibly have been double-owned) and so far my account doesn’t seem to be compromised. I’m able to log in online and make sure my order history doesn’t have anything untoward, and opening the app is working like normal (though I received a few errors earlier in the day). I haven’t received any emails, texts, or other communications from the company regarding this situation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sj6f0YP8i1FoTvugJ7E9tmVjifQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922737/IMG_2881.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The error message I received earlier trying to log into the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ofVyAc"&gt;Without much official word from the company, it’s hard to say exactly how the reported breaches happened, and what any potential hackers have access to — though we’ll keep you updated if we hear back. With many security breaches, the advice is to change your password and make sure you have two-factor authentication turned on, but Visible &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q53nk9/lack_of_2fa_on_visisble/"&gt;currently doesn’t support 2FA&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, incidents like this where some customers are seeing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Buttered_Pecans/status/1447413221057462275?s=20"&gt;$1,000-plus charges&lt;/a&gt; on their credit cards from Visible may make that feature a higher priority.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces Unpacked 2 event for Wednesday Oct 20th, right after Apple and Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KVR4JRpTmrHFcTSVE6s5D6S9qBk=/0x0:1013x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986975/Samsung_Galaxy_Unpacked_Part2_Static_Samsung.com.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GKa0mn"&gt;Samsung has just sent out invitations for an event it is holding online on Wednesday, October 20th at 7AM PT / 10AM ET. It’s called “Galaxy Unpacked Part 2,” which is possibly an indication that rather than all new Galaxy phones, we may be seeing iterations on existing ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLUUSo"&gt;With Samsung’s announcement, we’ll now have an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;Apple event on Monday&lt;/a&gt; (where we are expecting new MacBook Pros), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 launch on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, and now Samsung’s apparently smaller event on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqhR10"&gt;In addition to the invite’s image, Samsung’s newsroom post announcing the event hints at some kind of personalization for Galaxy devices: “Our users are multifaceted and live life in so many colorful, interesting, and unique ways. As such, the technology they use every day should reflect their individuality. Join Galaxy Unpacked Part 2 on October 20 to see how Samsung is opening up new experiences for self-expression through technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85GIiz"&gt;That could mean anything, but it does seem to hint at new colors of the Galaxy phones or maybe even a full-on customization option. I could imagine building a Z Flip 3 with my choice of colors on each side of the fold, for example, and the teaser image may hint at just that. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21407750/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-2-price-release-date-hinge-screen-durability"&gt;With the Z Fold 2,&lt;/a&gt; Samsung offered customers the option to choose their own accent color for the hinge, though that option went away on the Z Fold 3 (thus far, anyway). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H85ZA6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s going to be a very busy week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWsqIi"&gt;Of course, no customization program has come &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/5/4588922/moto-x-review"&gt;close to the original Moto X&lt;/a&gt;, which let people chose any number of different color options and even materials for their phone — including bamboo. It seems unlikely that Samsung will be willing to go that far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0UJLu"&gt;What seems even more unlikely is the Galaxy S21 FE, a lower-cost “fan edition” of the Galaxy S21 that’s been kicking around the rumor mill for a while now. It’s less likely mainly because the S21 FE is currently in a kind of limbo where it’s either been delayed or cancelled because of the chip shortage. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s22-delayed-galaxy-s21-fe-quiet-launch-january/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sammobile&lt;/em&gt; reports that Samsung is still considering a January launch for the S21 FE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veyIZQ"&gt;Regardless of what Samsung announces on Wednesday the 20th, it will have a hard time getting attention after all the Sturm (Apple) and Drang (Google) the previous two days. Though perhaps picking Wednesday is Samsung’s strategic attempt to wrest some interest away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;the Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnDwLD"&gt;Speaking of it being a busy week, we also have &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s 10 year event called &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;On The Verge&lt;/a&gt; on Friday and Saturday. If you’re in New York City, tickets are available at a &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;discount with code $99NOW right here&lt;/a&gt;. This leaves Thursday the 21st open for another tech company to announce something. Has anybody heard from OnePlus lately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLbaaV"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet Nokia G300, the $199 5G phone for Tracfone and Straight Talk customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/omd8QiOl4gfCJTEZBwjzk-LNN38=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69983632/Nokia_G300_Lifestyle_Image__5_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G300 is a 5G-enabled phone with a 6.52-inch LCD and 4,470mAH battery.&lt;/em&gt; | HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bFxqDG"&gt;Why should postpaid mobile customers have all the 5G fun? HMD Global, the manufacturer behind new Nokia phones, is announcing its most affordable 5G phone yet for Tracfone and Straight Talk Wireless’ prepaid customers — the Nokia G300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0vG31"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557433/t-mobile-revvl-v-5g-price-screen-specs-availability"&gt;T-Mobile’s $199 REVVL V Plus 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the Nokia G300 doesn’t try to wow you with flagship-level specs but offers the bread-and-butter features you’ll care about at an affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFQXa5"&gt;One of the most useful features of the G300 is its fingerprint scanner. It is integrated with the power button so that you can inconspicuously unlock your phone while pressing the same button to wake it up. Of course, you can also use your face to unlock the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ceh2mc"&gt;It has a reasonably large 4,470mAh battery, which Nokia claims will last about two days before needing a charge. It also mixes in some old tech with the new: a 3.5mm audio jack for your wired headphones, radio antenna, NFC, and it runs Android 11 out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sh3NKs"&gt;The G300’s 16-megapixel rear camera has a relatively large aperture (f/1.8) that, coupled with its 2-megapixel depth sensor and 5-megapixel ultrawide camera (f/2.2), already sounds like a step up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557433/t-mobile-revvl-v-5g-price-screen-specs-availability"&gt;REVVL V Plus 5G’s camera&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, this phone can record 1080p videos at 60 frames per second, using electronic image stabilization (EIS) to help reduce your hand’s natural shakiness. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRH3WfH1pu0l4CXBDn1-vbECPkE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920346/Nokia_G300_Product_Image__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Nokia G300 variant in charcoal, with 64GB of storage and 4GB RAM, will be available for sale on October 19th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TZJHup"&gt;Of course, the G300’s low price tag comes at a price. It has a 6.52-inch HD Plus LCD display that is quite low resolution for its size (720 x 1600 pixel, 20:9 aspect ratio). Like the similarly priced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt;, it only comes with 64GB of internal storage, which means you’ll need to invest in a microSD card to expand this phone’s storage capacity. The G300 is also powered by the same 5G-compatible Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor as the N200 and is supported by 4GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8iuRP"&gt;While the Nokia G300 is 5G-ready, this variant is only capable of sub-6GHz speeds, which means it’s only compatible with T-Mobile’s 5G network, not AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon’s 5G technologies. Normally, when you bring your own device to these two mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), you get to choose which carrier to use because they work with all the carriers, but not in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZfilG"&gt;You can order the $199 Nokia G300 from Tracfone and Straight Talk Wireless on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;same day the new Pixel 6 phones will be announced&lt;/a&gt;. This configuration — in charcoal with 64GB storage and 4GB RAM — will be available for purchase directly from both companies on October 19th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lK6dB4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9hQNp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQFLRB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung tries to prove its foldable phones are tough in a new test video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UarNK6vTmdy6i9vxmbC12o2a_ys=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69981970/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_22.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mE5U41"&gt;Samsung is sharing new details about how it tests the durability of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3. However, it’s unclear exactly why Samsung is releasing this information now, especially given that both phones launched in August; that makes us think it could be an attempt to assuage fears sparked by recent reports of cracks on Galaxy Z Flip 3 screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9pkuS"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpWHBvxmDV0"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted on &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/how-samsung-galaxy-z-fold3-flip3-5g-test-behind-the-scenes/?utm_source=pr_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung shows four separate tests. One has the phones in an environmental chamber, where Samsung tests the phones under different climates to make sure they still work. Another test engulfs the phones in water. One uses a robot arm to test the performance of the S Pen on the Z Fold 3. A fourth test folds both phones over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mcZ5Vm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has shown off its stress tests in the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uj2fHy"&gt;Samsung has shown off its stress tests in the past — one video &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-11-26-samsung-smartphones-stress-test.html"&gt;from 2012&lt;/a&gt; showed a robot butt sitting on phones, for example. And it’s not just Samsung; Apple described its phone antenna testing in detail &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eXYOA8TCk&amp;amp;t=701s"&gt;in response&lt;/a&gt; to the iPhone 4’s “Antennagate” scandal and showed off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6845611/inside-apples-iphone-6-torture-building"&gt;iPhone testing lab&lt;/a&gt; after the iPhone 6 was found to be prone to bending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZjJur"&gt;Samsung’s tests shown on Monday don’t specifically address the issue of why Z Flip 3 screens seem to be cracking, though. There are increasing numbers of reports of cracks appearing in the middle of the screen right about where the phone’s hinge is. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; had &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/07/galaxy-z-flip-3-glass-durability-diary/"&gt;a particularly worrying story&lt;/a&gt; on October 7th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sdT2jI"&gt;Recently, I picked up my Galaxy Z Flip 3 review unit after a few days of no use, and I was shocked to see that the ultra-thin glass had broken. I hadn’t dropped the phone in recent days (only once in my usage, &lt;em&gt;weeks &lt;/em&gt;beforehand), I hadn’t exposed it to extreme heat or cold, I hadn’t even really touched it over the course of at least a few days, so the shattered glass came as a genuine shock to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="26l9NY"&gt;A user on Reddit posted about a similar issue after &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxyzflip/comments/q2sz16/got_the_thing_less_than_three_days_ago_treated_it/"&gt;less than three days of owning the phone&lt;/a&gt;. Another said their phone’s screen cracked &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxyzflip/comments/p9a646/galaxy_z_flip_3_screen_fails_withing_24hrs_of/"&gt;within 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;. And the problem doesn’t seem to be exclusive to the Z Flip 3; as pointed out by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Fisher (aka MrMobile) said he saw tiny cracks &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XnHJhBNpWb4?t=562"&gt;on the hinge on his Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TiRMl7"&gt;One of the biggest questions about Samsung’s foldables has always been their durability, especially after the first Fold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511170/samsung-galaxy-fold-delay-indefinitely-statement-screen-display-broken-issues"&gt;was delayed&lt;/a&gt; because screens were breaking on review units. The reported issues with cracks show that there might still be some problems for Samsung to solve to ensure that their foldable phones don’t break over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Reader is still defunct, but now you can ‘follow’ RSS feeds in Chrome on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYh3waDQNxFaVXh14kN9NjB_EAE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971416/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uexd8M"&gt;Google Reader &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101144/google-shuts-down-reader-rss-aggregation-service"&gt;is still defunct&lt;/a&gt;, but its spirit lives on in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445284/google-rss-chrome-android-feature-test"&gt;a “follow button”&lt;/a&gt; for Chrome that Google first started experimenting with in May. The RSS tracking feature was limited to the experimental Canary versions of Chrome on Android, but today the company has started enabling it on stable versions of the browser, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/__apf__/status/1446503789586894850?s=20"&gt;according to Adrienne Porter Felt&lt;/a&gt;, a director of engineering on Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4biG0"&gt;You can follow a site through the browser’s three-dot menu to subscribe to its RSS feed and have it update in your Chrome app. Sites you’re following will appear in a tab called “following,” which sits along Google’s “for you” tab of recommended articles. The feature isn’t out yet on iOS, so I’m not able to check it out on my phone, but Felt shared some screenshots of what it looks like on Android so you can get an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Ca4WRly8AspM6-JbzS7iiyil4Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911040/ChromeFollow.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/__apf__/status/1446503789586894850?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;Adrienne Porter Felt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Follow button aggregates content from an RSS feed into cards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btggla"&gt;It’s not clear how many people already have access to the new feature by default, but you can enable it yourself by entering chrome://flags in your address bar and turning it on under web feed, Felt writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rkNRQ"&gt;The Chrome follow button is currently a mobile-only feature (iOS and desktop versions &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/__apf__/status/1446555070892429316?s=20"&gt;are coming&lt;/a&gt;), which will surely disappoint some Google Reader power users. Still, it’s at least nice to see Google keeping the RSS fire alive in some fashion. It makes the Chrome app even more crowded in terms of features, but if you were looking for a free, low-fuss way to keep up with some of your favorite sites, it seems like Google is once again willing to be that option.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Moto G Pure is a $159.99 4G phone with a MediaTek chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQFr149R1ALHaMj-uBuZw-WzQLU=/0x71:3508x2410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963420/moto_g_pure_key_visual_horizontal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure (2021) is a 4G phone that shares many of the same specs as the Moto G Play, but is $10 cheaper.&lt;/em&gt; | Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p3mI5W"&gt;Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Motorola is squeezing in one more budget-friendly phone into its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget"&gt;2021 Moto G lineup&lt;/a&gt; — the Moto G Pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1SsMd"&gt;At $159.99, the Moto G Pure is the least expensive member of Motorola’s lineup, with the already-released Moto G Play only costing about $10 more at $169 (before discounts). Both the Moto G Power and the G Stylus, on the other hand, cost significantly more at $199 and $299, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aWltE"&gt;The biggest difference between the Moto G Pure and the G Play is in their processors. The G Pure uses the MediaTek Helio G25, while the G Play uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 chip from 2020. Based on processor comparison data from &lt;a href="http://Nanoreview.net"&gt;Nanoreview.net&lt;/a&gt;, the Snapdragon 460 is the faster and more energy-efficient octa-core processor of the two. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;our review of the Qualcomm-powered Moto G Play&lt;/a&gt; already noted how under-powered that phone felt, so keep your expectations low for the MediaTek chip’s performance on the Moto G Pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kchl5"&gt;Like its more expensive sibling, the Moto G Pure also has 3GB RAM to support its processor, 32GB of internal storage that is expandable with a microSD card, and a 6.5-inch display at 720p that is a bit low-resolution for 2021. Other features that are unique to the G Pure: it is water repellent against light rain (IP52) and has a 4000mAh battery that Motorola claims can last up to two days, depending on use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMjnMKFDa1Iz8O2aVFG1g5Uj8gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22904847/moto_g_pure_deep_indigo_combo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure is water repellent (IP52), has an audio jack, as well as a radio antenna.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EyntJS"&gt;The G Pure’s camera system is similar to the G Play’s, but its 13-megapixel main camera has a slightly smaller f/2.2 aperture. There’s also a 2-megapixel depth sensor and a 5-megapixel front camera. Since Motorola is known for its fun photo software and smart AI, you can experiment with photography features like Spot Color, Auto Smile Capture, and Smart Compose on this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzYygv"&gt;The Moto G Pure is compatible with all the North American 4G LTE bands — from Verizon to Telus, but it doesn’t support any 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rK2ZN2"&gt;If you want to get your hands on this Moto G Pure as soon as possible, you’ll need to pre-order the unlocked version on October 14th, which retails for $159.99. It’ll be available from Best Buy, Walmart, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Amazon and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FMotorola.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22709569%2Fmotorola-moto-g-pure-mediatek-4g-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Motorola.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9PgEp"&gt;If you’re looking for carrier deals, Verizon will be offering this phone for “free” when you sign up for a new line with a 24–30-month payment plan (for $149.99 in value), starting October 14th. Metro by T-Mobile will also be offering a similar deal in the near future, but no timeline has been shared. Otherwise, you’ll need to hang tight for this phone to land in other carriers in both countries — within the next few months, according to the press release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is making its 5G home internet $10 cheaper</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2WAHy"&gt;T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fhome-internet-big-fee-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s cutting the price of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;5G-powered home internet service&lt;/a&gt; by $10, bringing it back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;the $50 price that it charged during its pilot program&lt;/a&gt;. That $50 a month gets you internet with no data cap, speeds that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Fplan%3Ficid%3DHEIS_ISW_C_20HMEINTPL_4201BARY4O4BX5HPG23552&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile estimates&lt;/a&gt; will be anywhere from 35 to 115 Mbps, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Fgateway&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a router&lt;/a&gt; capable of turning 5G and LTE into Wi-Fi (which you’ll have to return if you ever cancel the contract-free plan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0snAV"&gt;T-Mobile is adamant that your bill won't be higher than $50 — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fhome-internet-big-fee-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in its press release&lt;/a&gt; it says there’s no installation fees, activation fees, or equipment rental fees. It seems to view this as a kind of apology for all the fees traditional ISPs like Xfinity and Charter have charged. It’s pretty self-congratulatory, but it’s hard to argue that the service seems like a bad deal: I personally pay $80 a month for Comcast, and frequently find myself chafing under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;its data cap&lt;/a&gt; (though I haven’t been buried with fees like T-Mobile implies I should’ve been). If you’re interested you may want to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Feligibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check to make sure your address is eligible&lt;/a&gt; for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UPQgIk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At a flat $50 a month, the service doesn’t seem like a bad deal if you can get it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pe7eVk"&gt;Of course, there are still some asterisks. That $50 price is with automatic billing turned on — leaving it off means you’ll pay $55 a month instead. Plus, you are still paying taxes and fees, they’re just built into the price (T-Mobile’s estimates that they account for 3-12 percent of your bill can be found in the fine print). The company also warns that you could have your service slowed down in times of heavy congestion, though some of its executives have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s “unlikely”. And, while there’s no installation fee, that does mean that you have to do it yourself. The company estimates that’ll only take 15 minutes. If you’re seriously considering the service after the price cut, it’s worth giving our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;article explaining some of the potential downsides&lt;/a&gt; a read.&lt;/p&gt;
