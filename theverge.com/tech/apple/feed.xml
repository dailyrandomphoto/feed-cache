    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mrCmsy"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, the Google Nest Mini is a miniature take on the larger smart speakers that came before it. The compact device doesn’t boast the same sound quality as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;, but it's impressive for its size, especially when mounted to a wall or placed in a smaller room. What’s more, it packs backlit volume buttons and many of the same features that have come to define the category, including the ability to answer voice queries, control your smart home, and play music, adding to its overall versatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvIwq9"&gt;If you’re already tapped into the Google ecosystem or are looking for an inexpensive way to strew audio throughout your home, BuyDig is currently offering a three-pack of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F334087468632%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals073021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F30%2F22600005%2Fgoogle-nest-mini-smart-speaker-apple-magsafe-charger-macbook-air-m1-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Minis on eBay for $64&lt;/a&gt;, significantly less than if you were to pay per Mini. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lJFfNl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; has officially arrived, however, if you’re looking for a cheaper means for charging your iPhone 12, 12 Pro, or an older device that supports Qi charging, there’s always Apple’s MagSafe Charger. The simple, wired accessory attaches magnetically to the latest iPhone 12 models and allows for 15-watt charging speeds when paired with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20-watt power brick&lt;/a&gt; (sold separately). And while far slower than a traditional USB-C cable — it takes about an hour to charge an iPhone 12 to 40 percent — it’s also more convenient, especially given that it can charge AirPods models with a wireless charging case and older Qi-compatible accessories. Normally $40, Apple’s MagSafe Charger is currently &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDeals072921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-magsafe-charger-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Woot for $30&lt;/a&gt;, matching its best-ever price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3JSSKw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10676303"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="8it8dg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Apple MagSafe Duo charger is overpriced and under-delivers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="S6keLB"&gt;The latest MacBook Air launched less than a year ago and, like all Apple products, it’s not exactly known for being cheap. If you still want to make the jump to Apple’s M1 chip, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747617164066258670#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently knocking $250 off&lt;/a&gt; the price of the 256GB model with 8GB of RAM, a new low for Apple’s 13-inch laptop. To take advantage of the deal before it expires on August 1st, you need to log in or sign up for a free My Best Buy account and enroll in the Student Deals program, a move that takes an additional $100 off the $850 sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wvXJY"&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with the latest MacBook Air, it’s currently one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. The 2020 model boasts excellent battery life, impressive performance, and a well-built design. Plus, it’s available in three colorways: gold, space gray, and silver. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why Apple says it hates leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kusRJHhZqdRuCNeerWCWmKayuBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655218/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SoXH7n"&gt;Apple is a notoriously secretive company, and a cease and desist letter recently &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzp9z/apple-says-leaks-cause-companies-to-make-iphone-cases-at-the-wrong-size"&gt;acquired by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sheds new light on &lt;em&gt;exactly &lt;/em&gt;why, arguing that leaks harm accessory makers, consumers, and Apple itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keC9kg"&gt;The C&amp;amp;D order reportedly sent to a Chinese citizen by Apple’s lawyers in China, says that leaks about Apple’s iPhone dimensions could mislead case manufacturers, who might make accessories that are incompatible with the final product. As Apple puts it, “third-party accessory manufacturers may develop and sell mobile phone cases and other accessories that are not actually compatible with the unreleased products.” &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; notes that the market for Apple accessories is estimated to be worth almost $20 billion worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VJMZXI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The secret of Apple’s latest technological innovation is an important part of the company DNA”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwwyrk"&gt;Apple also says that leaked info prevents the company from being able to surprise and delight consumers at launch events. “Apple has made every effort to take strict measures to maintain confidentiality for any information about Apple’s products before their official release to ensure that every time Apple releases a new product, it can surprise the public,” the letter reads. “The secret of Apple’s latest technological innovation is an important part of the company DNA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYSwLp"&gt;“Such situations harm the interests of consumers and Apple. Therefore, it is obvious that when the unpublished information about the design and performance of Apple’s products is kept confidential, it has actual and potential commercial value,” Apple’s letter reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqjRjQ"&gt;The letter was sent as part of what appears to be a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyv5bm/apple-tells-leaker-to-snitch-on-sources-or-it-will-report-them-to-the-police"&gt;crackdown on&lt;/a&gt; the sale of prototypes of unannounced Apple products on social media. These devices are allegedly stolen by factory employees and sold to anyone that could benefit, often resulting in information about the products being made public far in advance of their official announcements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZ2692"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyv5bm/apple-tells-leaker-to-snitch-on-sources-or-it-will-report-them-to-the-police"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the cease and desist letter it obtained was dated June 18th. It’s unclear how many individuals were sent similar letters, but it notes that the month coincides with the Twitter account of a seller, who went by the name “Mr. White,” disappearing from the platform. Also in June, a leaker known as “Kang” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22551182/kang-letter-apple-leak-warning-iphone-12"&gt;revealed on Weibo&lt;/a&gt; that they’d received a notice from the company, and indicated that they’d stop posting about upcoming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLzI8I"&gt;Beyond what Apple outlines in its letter, there are a host of reasons why companies are widely understood to not want their unannounced plans to be made public. The release of confidential product information might allow competitors to start to develop copycat devices ahead of time. And hearing that an upgraded device is on the way could make people less likely to buy an existing model, per the so-called “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect"&gt;Osborne effect&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrBopN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVjIfQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sgt. Pepper’s to get new Atmos mix because current version ‘doesn’t sound quite right’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MEXICO-PHOTOGRAPHY-BEATLES-SGT PEPPER-EXHIBITION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TmA515p05T7O6mIochM09HBPttA=/0x16:3242x2177/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69654962/847150650.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read JULIO CESAR AGUILAR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPHUBG"&gt;The Beatles seminal &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band&lt;/em&gt; is set to receive another Dolby Atmos mix, after producer Giles Martin, son of the album’s original producer George Martin, admitted that the current version “doesn’t sound quite right.” The current mix, produced by the younger Martin in 2017, was made with Dolby Atmos theaters in mind, rather than personal listening via services like Apple Music. “I’m gonna replace it,” the said the two time Grammy winner &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/beatles-best-spatial-audio-albums-apple-music-abbey-road-giles-martin-1202832/"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “It’s good. But it’s not right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIHwMA"&gt;The current Atmos mix of the album was created to &lt;a href="https://professional.dolby.com/sgt-peppers/"&gt;coincide with its 50th anniversary in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, it was designed to be played in Dolby Atmos cinemas at a series of live listening events. But now that it is available via streaming services like &lt;a href="https://news.dolby.com/en-WW/184454-sgt-pepper-s-lonely-hearts-club-band-the-immersive-experience-launches-in-liverpool-photo-image-apple-corps-ltd#:~:text=all%20tickets%20for%20the%20free%20event%20are%20now%20fully%20sold%20out.%20however%2C%20fans%20around%20the%20world%20can%20immerse%20themselves%20within%20these%20recordings%2C%20which%20are%20available%20to%20stream%20in%20dolby%20atmos%20via%20amazon%20echo%20studio%20and%20amazon%20music%20hd%20for%20the%20first%20time%2C%20with%20further%20services%20to%20follow%20in%202020."&gt;Amazon Music HD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;more recently Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, people are listening to it in smaller rooms or with headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0sly17"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sgt. Pepper’s is a theatrical mix that’s then being converted into a smaller medium”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VEQYdq"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt; was, I think, the first album ever mixed in Dolby Atmos. And we did that as a theatrical presentation,” Martin explains. “So &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt; is a theatrical mix that’s then being converted into a smaller medium. Therefore, it’s not quite right. I’m gonna go back to the theatrical mix and make it into what’s called near-field Dolby Atmos, as opposed to the cinema Dolby Atmos. It’s a bit bright. It’s a bit digital. But again, I’m gonna replace it, so that’s cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdyRx7"&gt;According to Martin, the spatial mix of &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt; “seems to lack a bit of bass and a little bit of weight behind it.” In comparison, the Atmos mix of &lt;em&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/em&gt;, which was produced for &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; 50th anniversary in 2019 is “a much better-functioning Atmos mix because it’s much closer to the stereo mix, sonically.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6bCB8"&gt;What’s particularly fascinating about &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt;, is that the album was released at a time when mono recordings were the primary focus for most producers, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/05/23/528678711/why-remix-sgt-peppers-giles-martin-the-man-behind-the-project-explains"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;George Martin reportedly spent three weeks mixing the original mono version of the album, before spending just three days on the stereo release. The album has effectively lasted through three eras of music: first mono, then stereo, and now spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AII87B"&gt;With spatial audio in its infancy, there are plenty of examples out there of well known albums that don’t sound quite right in the new format. My colleague Chris Welch outlines a few of these in his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;review of Apple Music’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, where songs like “Buddy Holly” by Weezer and “What’s My Age Again?” by Blink 182 suffer from problems like muffled vocals and lifeless guitars. But hopefully these are just growing pains associated with a relatively new format, and we’ll one day look back on these tracks like we look back on early stereo recordings from the 60s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjNsz1"&gt;Giles Martin’s &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/beatles-best-spatial-audio-albums-apple-music-abbey-road-giles-martin-1202832/"&gt;full interview with &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is well worth a read for the producer’s insights on the potential for spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDUWki"&gt;If a year inside convinced you to shoot your shot at becoming an international DJ, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/07/garageband-features-new-sound-packs-from-dua-lipa-lady-gaga-and-top-producers/"&gt;Apple is updating GarageBand for iOS and iPadOS on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; with a low-stakes way to start dabbling in the world of remixes. GarageBand’s Remix Sessions lets you try your hand at remixing tracks from Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga with short video tutorials available to watch while you mess with loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11Yslx"&gt;You can access the new Remix Sessions from the Sound Library section of GarageBand. There’s currently only one song for each artist, “Break My Heart” for Dua Lipa and “Free Woman” for Lady Gaga, but the amount of samples and loops each song comes with is surprisingly broad. If you’ve played with GarageBand’s Live Loops before, the experience should be self-explanatory. Apple’s implementation of its video tutorial is a bit clunky — the downloaded artist’s Live Loops project will show up in your GarageBand, but to watch while you edit your song, you have to start the video in the Sound Library page and pop it into picture-in-picture mode manually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QyeX-lAvjsQQLIegK_7GcCrLucQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748868/apple_garageband_update_jul21_remix_lady_gaga_07292021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can watch video tutorials with tips from Lady Gaga or Dua Lipa while you remix their songs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L1sBBm"&gt;Apple is also releasing “hundreds of royalty-free loops, beats, instruments, drum kits, synth patches, and samples” in downloadable Producer Packs that, like the Remix Sessions, include video content that Apple says offers insight into the producers’ creative process. If a companion Mark Ronson Live Loops project that ties in to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/06/apple-tv-unveils-trailer-for-new-docuseries-watch-the-sound-with-mark-ronson/"&gt;an upcoming Apple TV Plus show&lt;/a&gt; is of interest to you, that’s available, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqNt3S"&gt;Interestingly, these new GarageBand perks are currently only available on iOS and iPadOS: users of the original macOS desktop version will have to go without Lady Gaga’s encouragement. The macOS version of GarageBand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17490656/apple-garageband-new-update-1000-new-loops-artist-lessons-free"&gt;does include “Artist Lessons” for free&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ph24954?locale=en_US"&gt;more hands-on educational videos&lt;/a&gt; for specific instruments like guitar or piano, so there’s at least something for you there if you’re trying to start your music journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zYqGD"&gt;GarageBand’s Remix Sessions and Producer Packs are available to download now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — all of which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256G SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $850 and $899, respectively. Both retail giants also have the 512GB configuration on sale in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5M9XBS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all three colorways for $1,099&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;), a discount of $150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $200 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afDps1"&gt;The upgraded version of the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LH3F7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532652589677821#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in two configurations at Amazon: one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999, or one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. Amazon currently has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in space gray &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FZV45H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $2,000&lt;/a&gt;, a $400 discount. There are other configurations available with more storage and quicker processors — for instance, you can also get the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,300 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; — but deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="fZkCsg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We’ve seen the base model drop to as low as $600, however, right now it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html%2F%3Fap%3Dy%26ap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26lsft%3DBI%253A514%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwieuGBhAsEiwA1Ly_ncXHhq-iWKpvrfYtFChI-bPVIWkyhdRKI-PNhmoD9yjMSRUfQWhABRoCntMQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo for as low as $649&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers at a repair facility used by Apple compare conditions to sweatshops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MxZMxUAwaJR3jbZv8zkeTr2yIc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642266/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eKwK9I"&gt;Workers at a Houston, Texas facility that processes repairs for Apple, Dell, and Lenovo reportedly say they are working in “sweatshop” conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;according to a story from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Workers’ toilets are reportedly unsanitary and insufficient, they say they lack air conditioning, and they claim their pay is low at CSAT Solutions, a company that acts as a repair partner for tech companies like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlrWzk"&gt;In the report, which is &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;worth reading in its entirety&lt;/a&gt;, employees also reportedly say there aren’t enough bathrooms or parking spots for the number of workers, and that they’re not allowed to use their phones while working, even in the case of family or personal emergencies. One employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that she got off work to discover that her son had been taken to the hospital after being burned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Su658a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some employees expected an environment that reflected the prestige of the Apple brand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V4E92a"&gt;The working conditions alleged at CSAT took some employees by surprise, according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, as they expected an environment reflective of the prestige that comes with the Apple brand. Instead, they reportedly faced quotas that were difficult to meet, and pay that ranged from $12 to $14 an hour, with little hope for raises or promotions. Some employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that they had to work 60 hours a week just to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUWPKl"&gt;A CSAT Solutions representative told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the company has “high workplace standards,” that the company takes great pride in the opportunities it provides its employees and that it takes allegations seriously and investigates complaints. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which can be read in full below, Apple said that it will be investigating the allegations and that its focus is “making sure that everyone in [its] supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect.” Dell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it “takes all allegations of this nature seriously, and will investigate fully,” and Lenovo didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="73XQaj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees reportedly felt like their requests and concerns were unaddressed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kKaZ4E"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, employees felt as if their previous concerns and reports to management had been ignored. Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it has assessed CSAT’s Houston location multiple times in recent years, but didn’t discuss its findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veJanZ"&gt;The practice of Apple visiting and inspecting suppliers’ facilities, however, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seems to be routine&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) to the point that suppliers may be able to paint themselves in a more positive light. &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;’s report includes stories from multiple employees about being asked to carry out work in a more by-the-book fashion when Apple’s auditors were around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypoowl"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has the highest standards in the industry, and it has a page on its website &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated to talking about supplier responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the company’s suppliers have faced accusations of poor factory working conditions, with three stories about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;forced labor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;labor law violations&lt;/a&gt; (where Apple allegedly turned a blind eye), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22172383/workers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;protests of pay reduction&lt;/a&gt; coming out in December 2020 alone. There’s also recently been the issue of Apple’s own employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;fighting for the ability to work remotely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WVeMCI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CSAT also does work for Dell and Lenovo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFy9NR"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; report also raises concerns about CSAT’s usage of temp agencies to hire workers. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Responsibility Standards&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), its standards also apply to subcontractors, and Apple’s suppliers are responsible for ensuring that the companies they hire are also in compliance. The responsibility, however, is not Apple’s alone — according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, CSAT also does work for Dell and Lenovo. In particular, Dell’s logo shows up frequently &lt;a href="https://www.csat.com/about/"&gt;in the promotional video atop CSAT’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7d0adt"&gt;Employee reviews for CSAT Solutions on sites like &lt;a href="https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Csat-Solutions/reviews"&gt;Indeed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CSAT-Solutions-Reviews-E483310.htm"&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; echo some of the concerns brought up by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, with many &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW38166423.htm"&gt;comparing working conditions to sweatshops&lt;/a&gt;, warning prospective employees about &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW47647065.htm"&gt;low pay&lt;/a&gt;, and expressing dissatisfaction with &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW46375146.htm"&gt;working hours&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW45963998.htm"&gt;quotas&lt;/a&gt;. A few reviews also back up the claims about the cleanliness and availability of the bathrooms, the heat, and broken air conditioners, as well as the strict no-cellphone rules. There are a fair number of positive reviews as well, but many of them are from non-repair employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0MlK1"&gt;In response, CSAT claims it’s required to keep its buildings climate controlled by its clients, with regular maintenance and upgrades to the HVAC and climate control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="odHgic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;60-hour workweeks are often mentioned in CSAT employee reviews&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="As7HOc"&gt;A job listing for a computer repair technician position at CSAT, found on the company’s website, says that candidates must be willing to work overtime, without saying how much. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s standards&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) state that workweeks have to be restricted to 60 hours, including overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="C22ptY"&gt;Here’s Apple’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NcrptJ"&gt;We uphold the highest standards in the industry and regularly assess our suppliers to ensure they comply. We have undertaken three assessments at CSAT in Houston in recent years, and Apple members regularly visit the site. We take all allegations seriously and will investigate.

    <title>Apple will require masks again in most of its US stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Apple Store Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tdZEjxMAhexg8qebj3MM6MGIQUg=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646869/1234211745.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MejYUc"&gt;Apple will be requiring customers and staff at most of its more than 270 US retail stores to wear masks even if they are vaccinated, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-28/apple-to-restore-mask-mandate-at-most-stores-for-shoppers-staff?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to a new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, bringing back a requirement that had been removed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement"&gt;starting in June&lt;/a&gt;. The change goes into effect Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvlBaF"&gt;“After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store,” Apple informed workers in a memo obtained by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members — even if they’re vaccinated.” Apple employees who work in its corporate offices have also been told they must wear masks inside of Apple office buildings, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zea24U"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FBDbiP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;COVID-19 case rates are rising in many parts of the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B6DaVc"&gt;The move comes as COVID-19 case rates are rising in many parts of the country and on the heels of new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations advising people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 to wear masks indoors in public if “you are in an area of substantial or high transmission” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595945/cdc-mask-recommendations-vaccinated-delta"&gt;that were issued Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBDwI5"&gt;Google also upped its response to COVID-19 on Wednesday, saying that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;it would require employees to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; before they can return to the office and delaying its full return to offices from September to October 18th. Apple has also pushed its return to the office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584761/apple-return-to-office-delayed-covid-delta-variant"&gt;until October at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Live Text is no longer an M1-exclusive in Apple’s newest macOS Monterey beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZpNI9iGxQLe4QT36gmNEZ01j8Q=/85x0:1543x972/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642186/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_4.24.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fHwoDE"&gt;Apple is expanding which devices can use one of its previously M1-chip exclusive features in the fourth macOS Monterey beta. Live Text, the company’s new image scanning and text identifying feature, now runs on “all Mac computers that support macOS Monterey,” &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12-beta-release-notes"&gt;according to new documentation&lt;/a&gt; Apple released. As tech video creator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1420075589617209349?s=20"&gt;Rene Ritchie notes&lt;/a&gt;, that should mean Intel-based Macs. One user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/khronokernel/status/1420085999376363522"&gt;claims to have gotten it to work&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac Pro from 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpQPUO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; digitizes the text found in photos, allowing for smart features like making information like phone numbers and addresses searchable and interactive in Apple Photos and the Camera app. The new feature was one of several macOS Monterey highlights &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526224/macos-monterey-best-features-macs-intel-m1-exclusive"&gt;that Apple limited to its newer MacBook Airs, Pros, and iMacs&lt;/a&gt;, marking the company’s first real break in functionality between Macs running its custom-designed chips and those with Intel processors. Now that might no longer be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GaMe3mClaoMLvIyK52xhIuFv55k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22744563/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_4.49.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text is no longe exclusive to M1-devices in Apple’s fourth beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wDqeqp"&gt;Support for all devices that officially run Monterey should include Macs from as far back 2013, based off &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey-preview/"&gt;Apple’s preview page&lt;/a&gt;. One thing that might have made it easier to bring Live Text to Intel: the Mac and iPhone use the feature in different ways. As Ritchie notes, the iPhone can process text live in-camera, a more demanding task than just analyzing a still photo. Since Macs don’t have an elaborate camera array to scan photos on the fly, they theoretically have a simpler time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY5dKC"&gt;MacOS Monterey will be released this fall, but if you’re interested in trying out Apple’s beta software (ideally not on your main device), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"&gt;you can follow our guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 12’s strong momentum helps Apple to another huge quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clqtS7ecySzoTeZgPvBdsNcjy6Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69641031/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y7kEjW"&gt;Apple’s string of record-breaking earnings reports continued on Tuesday, with the company posting a strong fiscal third quarter that saw &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F07%2Fapple-reports-third-quarter-results%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596120%2Fapple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$81.43 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a year-over-year increase of 36 percent and a new all-time record for the June quarter. It also crushes the $73 billion figure that analysts were expecting. Apple recorded a net quarterly profit of $21.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWldca"&gt;This quarter is traditionally one of the slower periods for iPhone sales, as consumer interest begins shifting toward the next lineup of devices that Apple is expected to announce in September. But sales were still impressively up — by nearly 50 percent — compared to this time a year ago, reflecting continued momentum for Apple’s first 5G smartphones. Mobile carriers have also continued to aggressively push the iPhone 12 lineup with various promotional discounts and offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJp909"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;Rumors strongly indicate&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro, and 13 Pro Max will be iterative upgrades over last year’s phones. The upper-end models could gain a 120Hz display, with the rest of the lineup set for processor enhancements and larger, improved cameras. Apple is also expected to slightly shrink the notch cutout on this year’s iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vgOZRg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iPhone sales up nearly 50 percent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EGS7dG"&gt;Mac and iPad sales were both up year over year, by 16.3 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively; CEO Tim Cook said that the Mac had its best June quarter ever, and the iPad’s was its best in “nearly a decade.” In recent months, Apple has shipped a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;redesigned 24-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;updated iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These devices are the latest to use Apple’s in-house M1 chip, and they rank among some of the most powerful hardware the company has released to date. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro features a Mini LED display, a technology that is rumored to appear in a revamped MacBook Pro later this year. The 16-inch MacBook Pro, Mac Pro, and larger-sized iMac have yet to make the transition to Apple’s own silicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnCArT"&gt;Apple continues to focus heavily on its services, which hit an all-time revenue high in the June quarter. In an effort to continue fueling Apple Music’s growth, Apple rolled out a new lossless streaming tier and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Dolby Atmos spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; for its premium music service in June. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, one of Apple TV Plus’ marquee originals, just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22590155/ted-lasso-apple-tv-plus-season-2-review"&gt;returned for its second season&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534960/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-channels-shows-app"&gt;podcast subscriptions and channels last month, as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gb2SyK"&gt;Beta testing is underway for the next wave of Apple’s major software updates, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15, iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, tvOS 15, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, and watchOS 8. They’ll all be officially released this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HX0b6J"&gt;Even as business keeps soaring, Apple continues to face significant regulatory scrutiny over antitrust concerns and the company’s commanding influence over the iPhone’s App Store. It’s barely removed from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546286/apple-tim-cook-nancy-pelosi-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-lobbying"&gt;an acrimonious trial with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. And with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;FTC now led by an antitrust pioneer&lt;/a&gt; and lawmakers in the United States considering a range of antitrust legislation, CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546286/apple-tim-cook-nancy-pelosi-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-lobbying"&gt;reportedly called Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; to warn against pushing through rushed policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZKgwt"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk took an opportunity to criticize Apple for its “walled garden” during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin"&gt;his company’s quarterly earnings&lt;/a&gt; call on Monday. “I think we do want to emphasize that our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy,” he said. “It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors which is used by some companies.” Musk then faked a cough and said “Apple.” Apple is believed to still be at work on its own electric vehicle, among other projects like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;augmented reality glasses&lt;/a&gt; that are likely to launch much earlier than the car. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s controversial Safari redesign is now optional in the latest iPadOS 15 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EKLX5R3LnEFcN_xPgem6edOWSIs=/0x0:2388x1592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640581/Polygon.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s current tab design squashes tabs and the search window into a single row.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNRznX"&gt;Apple has started trickling out its fourth iOS and iPadOS 15 betas, taking additional steps back from the bold, and somewhat ill-advised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;reimagining of Safari it debuted at WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Now the “compact” tab experience in nu-Safari is entirely optional, and the more traditional separate row of tabs that were &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-beta-3-brings-redesigned-safari-tab-interface-to-address-complaints/"&gt;reintroduced in the third macOS Monterey beta&lt;/a&gt; are heading to iPads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abz55u"&gt;Like in macOS Monterey (and every version of Apple’s desktop OS in recent history), tabs will once again live in their own separate row by default, alleviating some of the crowding that made Apple’s initial compact redesign annoying. The tab experience is now also controlled via a toggle in the Settings app, so if you’re committed to Apple’s original vision, you can enable it with a tap. You can see how the new settings option looks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1420072648822951937"&gt;in this screenshot shared by Federico Viticci&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8oeYhdOpJD7nTm-832P-ao4o9gU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743862/E7Uci5YWQAgdOaW.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Federico Viticci&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tabs now live in their own dedicated row by default in the fourth beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qM7Hck0QkrDPh71La9fp3p4IHj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743788/E7Uci5VXsAIUWGc.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Safari tab options in Settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OFYAZB"&gt;On iOS 15, the fourth beta also includes the return of the dedicated Reload button, one-tap access to Safari’s Reader mode, and a Share button, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/27/whats-new-in-ios-15-beta-4-safari-changes-focus-tweaks-and-more/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hj0pvY"&gt;These kinds of changes are what beta tests are for, and this all could entirely change again before the fall, but it is somewhat notable that this is the second major tweak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577475/apple-safari-macos-monterey-ios-15-developer-beta-3-change-design"&gt;Apple’s made to the new Safari&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s dealt with criticism over its design changes in the past (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2013/6/10/4416726/the-design-of-ios-7-simply-confusing"&gt;like iOS 7’s flat UI&lt;/a&gt;) but making tabs “normal” again by default does seem to suggest that on at least one element of the new Safari, Apple knows it got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
