  &lt;p&gt;Great gift ideas for those graduating into college and adulthood&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mDXDvd"&gt;It’s been a hard year for everyone, but it’s been especially grueling for high school seniors. Having to deal with classes, exams, and college applications and choices is difficult at the best of times but having to do most — or all — of it remotely during a plague year will stress even the most laid-back of students. So it stands to reason that this year’s grads deserve some extra-special gifts to make up for it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHCSKk"&gt;This year, we’ve tried to put together a list of devices and other products that will make it easier for graduates to start on their new adventure: Macs, Chromebooks, and Windows PCs; earbuds and speakers; and stuff to help with cooking, gaming, and sleeping. Take a look and see if any of these are right for any graduates whom you may want to present with a congratulatory gift.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic fights Apple in court by playing Candy Crush</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8aRSHJWu3EzAMytScMEO_0QAso=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69284564/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Expert testimony continues&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ITuW5D"&gt;Sometimes I reflect on my life and wonder where I went wrong, such that I am sitting on a wooden pew in federal court, watching a Google search for &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt; on the display monitor. This is a huge trial with major stakes for tech companies. It is also a crashing bore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMGhIJ"&gt;On the stand is Lorin Hitt, professor of operations, information, and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton, looking uncomfortable behind his face shield. During his direct examination in the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;trial, Hitt testified that he didn’t think having to access an app like &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; through a browser instead of the app counted as “friction” for the user — and that it certainly was less friction than “real-world” alternatives, such as leaving a convenience store and then crossing the street to go to another convenience store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vFugkD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s what is called a ‘fake game.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LKjeSv"&gt;The point of Hitt’s earlier testimony was that game developers “multi-home” games to PC and mobile. He’s Apple’s expert witness, and he is here to convince the judge that being blocked from the App Store isn’t a huge barrier to developers. Epic — whose game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is in fact blocked from the store — has taken Apple to court to show otherwise. And the picture Hitt painted on his direct examination was largely dismissive of Epic’s concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01wGSx"&gt;Epic attorney Yonatan Even, also in a face shield, is now doing his best to blow a hole in Hitt’s testimony. I am doing &lt;em&gt;my b&lt;/em&gt;est to follow a confusing spreadsheet that includes games that Hitt has promised are on both PC and mobile phones. Even begins by pointing out some of these games are not, in fact, available for PC. One game, &lt;em&gt;Words Story&lt;/em&gt;, is listed as available on PC on the document, but does not say this on the developer’s website. In the Microsoft store, a “&lt;em&gt;Words Story&lt;/em&gt;” with the same art exists, but it’s not the same developer. “Sir, this is not the same developer and not the same game, is it?” Even says. “It’s what is called a ‘fake game.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQKGdE"&gt;We go through this tiresome process for several games: &lt;em&gt;Helix Game&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crowd City&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BitLife&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Happy Glass&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Paper.io 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Mr. Bullet&lt;/em&gt;. I have never heard of any of these small-potatoes games, which makes them sort of a weird point of comparison for the most popular game in the world. The app developer pages suggest they are not available on PC, despite Hitt’s document to the contrary. Things are getting contentious, and Hitt is beginning to have a hang-dog “Rick Moranis in &lt;em&gt;Honey I Shrunk the Kids&lt;/em&gt;” vibe. Did Hitt double-check the data to make sure it was the same developer across stores? Can he tell the court under oath that a certain app is from the same developer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sZNdr"&gt; “Can you give the court sworn testimony that you have seen with your own eyes that this game is also available on PC?” Even asks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgUssh"&gt;Hitt can’t guarantee all the games listed in the unintelligible spreadsheet are from the same developer across all platforms, it turns out. He says his team of researchers did the analysis, and he trusts his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6QSD7l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s part of the frictionless process you have envisioned?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="afk38L"&gt;Hitt said earlier that he’d identified eight games that let people buy things on the iOS web browser, and then use them in iOS apps; these are identified in the spreadsheet. Epic has complained that this process isn’t good enough — and certainly isn’t ubiquitous. Now, Even raises the “frictionless” process that Hitt had blithely testified to earlier in the day. &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt; is the example Even chooses. We go to the website, and press “install,” where we are promptly sent to the App Store. We tab back to the website. The only possible way to play on the web is on desktop. The Facebook option for &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;, too, is desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2OY4i"&gt;“That’s part of the frictionless process you have envisioned?” Even asks, somewhat sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKfHr8"&gt;We try another game, &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt;, developed by Supercell. We go to Supercell’s FAQ, where it emerges that payment processes are only through Apple’s App Store or Google play. Supercell itself doesn’t keep payment information “And yet you believe that your team managed to go into a website and buy legitimate &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; money and go back to the app? That’s your testimony?” Even asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYZyTk"&gt;Then he twists the knife: The typical user of &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a research team, Even observes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rekc5I"&gt;I am terrified we are going to go through all eight apps, but thankfully Even spares us the exhaustion. According to Even, there are three apps that support buying something on the web, then using it in an app: &lt;em&gt; PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and… &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, however, is now banned from iOS.) Does Hitt have any basis to dispute this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="wAWadw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even’s point stands: most of us do not have research teams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v5Yz0z"&gt;Hitt says he trusts his team. I am feeling very bad for the team, which has largely been thrown under the bus by Hitt here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLM9Fb"&gt;On redirect, Apple’s Cynthia Richman tries to stop the bleeding. Sometimes developers license games to other developers — which might explain some of the cases where the developers don’t match. Hitt also tells us that Even’s rather brutal examples aren’t typical. Hitt has &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; purchased V-bucks on a mobile browser, he tells us proudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMqFMx"&gt;“It looked pretty difficult given the examples you provided,” says Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. What’s the explanation for why we couldn’t do these things during the cross-examination? Well, Hitt says, there were other links in the spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="zh3aNi"&gt;That may very well be true. But Even’s point stands: most of us do not have research teams. I wish I did — I could send them to the trial in my stead and blame them if the work was subpar. Instead, I am personally sitting through excruciating expert testimony. Why am I focusing on this, specifically? It’s the most interesting thing that happened all day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xXWN-t57Q2UyqQv662Bj9KonMk=/158x0:1883x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_2021_2.7.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eK0QNl"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeqTG9TtdMdfvxPoil_iBKPmKfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248903/vpavic_210119_4377_0153.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can’t say we like Samsung’s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it’s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IyREhz"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21 is often available for less than full retail price" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CuDtdwJTwbMBxwvpw_1cGz7AwFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258914/vpavic_210118_4378_0170.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 is often available for less than full retail price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wFbUhR"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 / S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oL8ji7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QzSdip"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hvSkHC"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 12 mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a step down from the 9 Pro, but it only gives up a few features at a significantly lower price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ofDQRV"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZJWuDD"&gt;If you want an excellent ultrawide camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uUgURs"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is the step-down model from the OnePlus 9 Pro, which is itself an excellent phone. But you don’t give up too much by opting for the 9, and you save a ton of money. Like the 9 Pro, it offers great performance with a Snapdragon 888 processor, fast 65W wired charging, and something that will appeal especially to the landscape photographers out there: a great ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2S7w"&gt;The sensor behind the OnePlus 9’s ultrawide camera is physically larger than most and offers a healthy 50-megapixel resolution. A unique lens design corrects distortion without introducing the funhouse mirror-type stretching you’ll often see in the corners of ultrawide images. And if super-wide photography isn’t your thing, know that the main camera turns in solid image quality, too. Images are well-exposed, and colors look pleasantly vibrant. OnePlus makes a big deal of the Hasselblad color science at work here, which does a fine job but isn’t as mind-blowingly good as the company suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O804KE"&gt;Unfortunately, you do miss out on a couple of good camera features opting for the 9 rather than the 9 Pro. The main camera on the 9 Pro offers optical image stabilization, which isn’t included on the 9, and is useful for its ability to keep subjects looking sharp in lower light conditions. There’s also no telephoto lens — just digital zoom, which isn’t as good as the 9 Pro’s optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The OnePlus 9 also doesn’t work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. (It works on both T-Mobile and Verizon’s 5G networks, however.) That’s no great loss right now (honestly, it might be for the better), but in a couple of years, this will probably become a downside. Bearing this in mind and a couple of camera feature omissions, the OnePlus 9 is an excellent device. It offers a flagship feel and performance for a bit less than the highest-end Android options and a seriously good ultrawide camera for wide-angle photo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A52 5G offers a large 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz refresh rate, a feature that’s not too common yet in the midrange class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z3SklF"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best cheap phone with high-end features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gfmz0Z"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G is our current pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best Android phone under $500&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also worth highlighting here for its combination of features usually reserved for premium devices and a reasonable price. You won’t get all the bells and whistles of the S21 series phones, of course, but the A52 5G includes a 6.5-inch screen with fast 120Hz refresh rate, an IP67 water resistance rating, and (for now, at least) access to monthly bug fixes and security updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rl0lbP"&gt;The A52 5G delivers on the basics too. Its Snapdragon 750G processor isn’t the fastest in the game but it keeps up well with day-to-day tasks. Its 4,500mAh battery delivers well over a day of moderate to heavy use. And the phone supports sub-6GHz 5G, which will allow it to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5qamU"&gt;Then there’s the typically Samsung-y stuff, including a UI that’s currently trending toward over-cluttered with the occasional unwelcome ad. The phone’s camera hardware is good, though photos tend to look a little oversaturated, which may or may not suit your taste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the phone’s best features is Samsung’s commitment to providing four years of security updates. Overall, it’s a relatively affordable device with a solid feature set that should keep up for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $400&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $400. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 2 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. Since it debuted for $2,000, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364162/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-price-cut-announced-1800"&gt;permanently marked down by $200&lt;/a&gt;, but you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maybe it’s time for a HomePod fire sale, Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="holding a homepod" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W178FenhVLLHbLNbygw413fhIt0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283215/jbareham_180202_2266_0295.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0KzKs9"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/12/homepod-still-available-for-purchase-two-months-after-being-discontinued/"&gt;been some buzz recently&lt;/a&gt; about how Apple is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-is-still-struggling-to-unload-its-launch-day-home-1846877912"&gt;having problems getting rid of its HomePods&lt;/a&gt;, with the now-discontinued Siri speakers still being on sale two months after Apple announced their discontinuation. And yet, the speakers are still $300, which is only slightly lower than their launch price of $350. Apple: it’s time to put them on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRsOh9"&gt;Here’s an anecdote to show how hard it’s been for Apple to unload these things: I bought a HomePod &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;the day its discontinuation was announced&lt;/a&gt;. An online tool tells me that it was made in October 2017, which was before Apple even started selling them in January 2018. That’s pretty rough, especially given that it’s a “space gray” one, seemingly the more popular of the two colors given that the white ones are &lt;em&gt;still available &lt;/em&gt;from Apple’s website. The same thing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DetroitBORG/status/1372259697135386631?s=20"&gt;also happened to tech YouTuber DetroitBORG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6D693TByx_m5JUHMgFu92XQHno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512738/Screen_Shot_2021_05_13_at_12.43.32_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s so in stock I could have one delivered by the time this article goes up for less than $10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X4h05F"&gt;Listen, Apple. I know that selling these things off for $200, or even $150, would pretty much be admitting defeat, but these things are still in stock two months after they were discontinued. It’s a great speaker, but at $300, it just doesn’t make sense given its complete lack of inputs that aren’t powered by Siri or AirPlay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grgtjw"&gt;Fire sales always get people excited: just today, a few of my colleagues &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1392834164639031302?s=20"&gt;started pining for a Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/13/22433893/microsoft-surface-duo-hori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-anker-sale-deal"&gt;Microsoft slashed its price&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1392834606479642629?s=20"&gt;even though they’ve heard&lt;/a&gt; all about how painful it is to use). There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/08/19/hp-drops-touchpad-price-stone-good-luck-snapping-buy-99"&gt;the famous HP Touchpad&lt;/a&gt;, a tablet which was flatly ignored until HP took the price from $399 to $99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lie0F"&gt;I most certainly don’t need another HomePod, but if there was one last hoorah sale that made it a reasonable price, I might forget that for a moment and buy one for my office. But Apple, please: it’s obvious you didn’t care enough for this speaker while it was alive. Just do something, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to finally close the loop. Put it on sale, “accidentally” include one with AirTag orders, whatever. Just let it go gently into that dark night, with no stock left.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple needs to show iOS allows competition... while justifying locking it down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DCRM2h3Ieo_PTWpFPdxciLGaDYQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279970/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yhoevp"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial will deliver a verdict on whether Apple is suppressing competition. But if you were watching Wednesday’s testimony, you could easily end up &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;confused about what its App Store actually allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2kXz0"&gt;Apple says iOS users benefit from a locked-down, curated platform. It rejects “stores within stores” like the Epic Games Store, which could allegedly expose users to harmful and unvetted software. It’s also, however, fighting Epic Games’ claims that there’s no meaningful competition on its platform. So this morning, an Apple attorney grilled one of Epic’s witnesses about a slew of iOS-hosted gaming apps. The move might have helped rebut Epic’s complaints, but it also highlighted just how arbitrary Apple’s policies can seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vO3Piu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“GameClub is a direct competitor to Apple Arcade, and GameClub is available in the App Store today”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vncLBS"&gt;Apple attorney Karen Dunn was questioning Susan Athey, an economist testifying on behalf of Epic. Athey criticized Apple yesterday for not allowing more “middleware,” or third-party services like alternate app stores. Dunn countered with several options that might fit that bill. The list included Valve’s Steam Mobile and Steam Link apps; Microsoft’s Xbox iOS app; Sony’s PlayStation app; and a mobile gaming subscription service named GameClub. “GameClub is a direct competitor to Apple Arcade, and GameClub is available in the App Store today,” Dunn said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQKjDz"&gt;Apple is right to call these apps gaming services, but as testimony continued, it wasn’t clear they make good App Store alternatives. Steam Mobile lets players manage games for Windows, Mac, and Linux — but not iPhones or iPads. The Steam Link, Xbox, and PlayStation apps all let you play a catalog of games on iOS — but only if you’ve got a PC or console to stream them from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQZzOe"&gt;GameClub &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;a cross-platform mobile gaming service. But right after Apple mentioned the app, a GameClub executive posted (and then deleted) a tweet calling that comparison “absurd beyond measure,” thanks to restrictions on how GameClub can operate. Athey testified that Apple rejected GameClub over 100 times, and that Apple only lets GameClub feature games to which it has an “exclusive license.” When &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;emailed GameClub business development VP Eli Hodapp, noting that Apple had described it as a successful iOS game-bundling service, Hodapp replied with “Are you serious?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o53r5T"&gt;The past week has demonstrated a bunch of extremely fine lines between what Apple considers good and bad. The iOS Xbox app allows console-based remote play, for instance. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"&gt;as Microsoft’s Lori Wright testified&lt;/a&gt;, Apple and Xbox failed to strike a deal for xCloud, which lets players stream games without an Xbox. Wright even accidentally got an &lt;em&gt;approved&lt;/em&gt; streaming app called Shadow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;kicked off the store&lt;/a&gt;, until Apple decided Shadow offered a “full Windows 10 PC, rather than a library of games.” From the outside, that looks more like a semantic dodge than a decision based on privacy, security, and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEe2uH"&gt;Apple hammered Epic for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;offering access to Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, a storefront featuring adult content. But Steam has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17435244/valve-steam-game-release-new-policy"&gt;nearly anything-goes policy&lt;/a&gt; on porn, and Steam Mobile and Link put those games a few taps away on iOS. Conversely, an App Store executive testified that Roblox user-built “experiences” were fine because they couldn’t sneak new, malicious code onto iPhones. But it’s said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;cloud gaming services threaten&lt;/a&gt; the iPhone’s “safe and trusted” model, despite being essentially just streaming video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rK5MJP"&gt;Being confusing or inconsistent doesn’t make Apple’s App Store illegal. Epic needs to demonstrate that Apple’s ecosystem counts as a monopoly, and moreover, that it’s hurting users by producing higher prices or subpar service. But part of Apple’s defense is that it’s a fair, consistent steward putting users’ best interests first. As the trial goes on, it’s sometimes hard to tell what it thinks those interests are.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Misogynistic’ Apple hire is out hours after employees call for investigation </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xIq2dM"&gt;Antonio García Martínez is no longer working at Apple hours after employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;circulated a petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for an investigation into his hiring. Martínez, a former Facebook product manager on the ad targeting team, authored a controversial book about Silicon Valley where he expressed misogynistic views on women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpSEnr"&gt;“We are deeply concerned about the recent hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” employees wrote in the petition. “His misogynistic statements in his autobiography — such as ‘&lt;em&gt;Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit’&lt;/em&gt; (further quoted below this letter) — directly oppose Apple’s commitment to Inclusion &amp;amp; Diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9PmH"&gt;More than 2,000 employees signed the petition before it was published by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0Yuvq"&gt;Shortly after the petition began circulating internally at Apple, Martínez’s Slack account was deactivated. The ad platforms team was called into an emergency meeting where it was confirmed Martínez would no longer be working at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BROfl5"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Apple spokesperson said: “At Apple, we have always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted. Behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSNvUd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jBojf7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 12, 9:36pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Apple has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;Antonio García Martínez is no longer with the company.&lt;/a&gt; The original story is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="68Mi9m"&gt;
&lt;p id="CwfNSW"&gt;A group of Apple employees has written a petition asking for an investigation into the hiring of Antonio García Martínez — a former Facebook product manager and author of the book &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2D4443"&gt;In the petition, the employees expressed concern about García Martínez’s views on women and people of color. His hiring “calls into question parts of our system of inclusion at Apple, including hiring panels, background checks, and our process to ensure our existing culture of inclusion is strong enough to withstand individuals who don’t share our inclusive values,” they write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9PmH"&gt;More than 2,000 employees signed the letter prior to its publication in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAagkL"&gt;García Martínez, who has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/author/antonio-garcia-martinez/"&gt;also written for &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was the product manager for Facebook’s ad targeting team from 2011 to 2013. Most of the things the Apple employees have expressed concern about come from &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys&lt;/em&gt; itself. (The book is dedicated to “all my enemies.”) The autobiography traces García Martínez going from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. García Martínez has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/8/9/12415696/antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-recode-decode-podcast-transcript"&gt;described the book&lt;/a&gt; as “total Hunter S. Thompson/Gonzo mode.” The employees, in the petition, view it differently: they say it’s racist and sexist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NDEfjB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s so exhausting being a woman in tech; sitting opposite men who think because of my gender, I am soft and weak and generally full of shit”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0fs9Ja"&gt;One screenshot from the book that has been circulating on Twitter calls women in the Bay area “soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7Fqto"&gt;“It’s so exhausting being a woman in tech; sitting opposite men who think because of my gender, I am soft and weak and generally full of shit,” wrote an Apple employee on Twitter, drawing attention to the quote. “It’s not even worth it to say I have worked relentlessly for every accomplishment I have.” The tweet also contained a screenshot of the passage in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qnioq"&gt;Silicon Valley has consistently had a white, male workforce. There are some in the Valley, such as notorious ex-Googler James Damore, who suggest this is because women and people of color &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16153740/tech-diversity-problem-science-history-explainer-inequality"&gt;lack the innate qualities needed to succeed in tech&lt;/a&gt;. But wave after wave of sex discrimination lawsuits tell a different story: that underrepresented groups have been &lt;em&gt;prevented&lt;/em&gt; from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGKFPT"&gt;At Apple, women make up 40 percent of the workforce but only 23 percent of the research and development teams, according to the company’s most recent diversity report. Half of the workforce is white, and 27 percent is Asian. “Across Apple, we’ve strengthened our long-standing commitment to making our company more inclusive and the world more just,” reads the header on the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/diversity/"&gt;website containing the report&lt;/a&gt;. “Where every great idea can be heard. And everybody belongs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRBLvn"&gt;Here’s the full text of the letter, which began circulating today (emphasis theirs): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="cuSgMh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10496899"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7sD6yz"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic v. Apple keeps coming back to the gap between ignorance and inconvenience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/58SAFjI73j_WHaXt4TY_U6lokRM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272119/vpavic_180607_2652_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LSZxry"&gt;Last week, the judge in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;asked whether Epic really had an antitrust case against Apple, or whether it just wanted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419894/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-2"&gt;help kids make impulse purchases&lt;/a&gt;. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers was talking about the importance of where and how&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;people pay for their apps, and today she continued that line of questioning to the point of suggesting a kind of App Store policy change that Epic never originally put on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwAZu0"&gt;Epic sued Apple for banning &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from iOS over a direct payment system for V-Bucks, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game currency. Epic called that unfair and monopolistic. But Apple argued that it lets developers sell in-app purchases through its Safari browser, even at a discounted price — so there’s no lockout. And while Epic itself has focused on explaining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;why web apps aren’t a good substitute for native ones&lt;/a&gt;, its expert witness David Evans brought up another major issue: anti-steering rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zkfpT"&gt;Anti-steering rules (in this context) &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_2093"&gt;refer to rules that ban&lt;/a&gt; developers from pointing users outside of Apple’s ecosystem. iOS developers can’t add links or references telling people to get a better deal on their website, or send emails to accounts created through Apple. Android has these rules too, but it &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/google-announces-crackdown-on-in-app-billing-aimed-at-netflix-and-spotify/"&gt;delayed a serious crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on them until this fall — and since you can install third-party stores and sideload apps on Android, developers in Google’s ecosystem have more options in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AhA7LQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An Epic witness compared app makers to moonlighting Uber drivers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNqBnD"&gt;Evans, an economist, was originally trying to explain in-app purchases by comparing Apple to a ride-hailing app like Uber, comparing an app developer to a Uber driver who had struck up a good relationship with a customer. The customer wanted to start directly hiring the driver, but the ride-hailing company (representing Apple) demanded that the customer keep paying through its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqngEz"&gt;Judge Rogers didn’t appear convinced. Buying V-Bucks through a browser, she noted, seemed a lot like a passenger directly paying a driver. “There’s nothing about that distribution process that impacted differently given your Uber example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nExCIp"&gt;Evans basically responded that in this analogy, cab drivers can’t even do the equivalent of giving passengers their phone numbers. “Epic is not able to message the iOS app user and tell them ‘You can go to the web and get this more cheaply.’ Or ‘I really encourage you to go to the web and get V-Bucks there,’” Evans objected. The problem, he said, was the combination of requiring Epic to use Apple payment processing, plus a “whole set of barriers” that make it harder to tell users they have an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gml1aD"&gt;These anti-steering provisions have come up in the trial before — yoga app maker Yoga Buddhi complained about them last week. But this time, Rogers offered an obvious followup question. If there was no anti-steering provision, she asked, would Epic still have a problem with Apple’s system? “The customer could choose whether they wanted to stay and make the purchase on the app or do it some other way, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3U1sKW"&gt;Evans admitted that nixing the anti-steering provisions “wouldn’t eliminate the market power that Apple has here, but it would certainly diminish it.” He said it would be more helpful for some apps than others — it’s pretty good for subscription-based companies that have a separate website, for instance, and less useful for mobile-only games that rely on a stream of microtransactions. But he acknowledged he hadn’t conducted a specific study of the topic, so he wasn’t sure exactly &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;big the issue would still be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RixG0U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumers do get klutzy and disconnected”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rfvFm6"&gt;Later in the day, economist Susan Athey raised a different issue with App Store exclusivity. The App Store lets users sign up for subscriptions, but if they switch to an Android phone, they have to either cancel their subscription or keep managing it through Apple. Athey was using this to explain why a third-party app store would be useful, should Apple ever allow one to exist — if you could access the same purchase from both big phone platforms, the same way you can get your old iOS apps on a new iPhone, switching devices could become much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Okte7i"&gt;But Rogers suggested again that if developers could just tell people to sign up through the web, “then there wouldn’t really be the same kind of need for the kind of cross-platform app store that you’re talking about.” After all, services like Netflix already direct people to sign up through their websites — Apple and Google just really don’t like it, and they try to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;discourage the practice&lt;/a&gt; without an actual ban. Similar to Evans, Athey conceded that there’d be a “big benefit” in letting app makers “alert people to the most efficient way to pay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVwlre"&gt;Athey argued that “consumers do get klutzy and disconnected and sensitive to delays when trying to complete that type of activity,” and telling people to go use a web browser doesn’t solve that problem. But Rogers could easily decide that inconvenience and enforced ignorance are separate issues, and that only the latter is a serious antitrust concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXDmwY"&gt;Getting rid of anti-steering provisions would be a comparatively small win for Epic, which wants to put full-fledged third-party App Stores on iOS. But it’s a smartphone ecosystem feature that’s often overshadowed by bigger antitrust complaints — and &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; is putting it under the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter is the new name of Project CHIP, the partnership that promises to simplify your smart home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/epha63qFJ9tZiyXSdZwKbEQHEpg=/249x0:1881x1088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269556/matter.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yym2p2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427139/amazon-apple-google-zigbee-alliance-open-source-smart-home-standard-2021-launch"&gt;Project Connected Home over IP (CHIP)&lt;/a&gt; — the ambitious smart home partnership that will see Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, the Zigbee Alliance, and dozens of other companies work together on an open standard — has gotten a new name: Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCp9iP"&gt;The rebranding comes ahead of the first Matter certifications, which are set to arrive before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387252/project-chip-will-finally-ship-later-this-year"&gt;the end of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The new branding and logo are designed to help make it easier for customers to tell which devices work with Matter’s unified system, with the logo set to appear on future hardware products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-v7LDftjLpwcTSLmERNUBtqukyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506925/Matter_Smart_Bulb.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="03T3RD"&gt;The goal of Matter is deceptively simple: make sure you’re able to use your smart home devices with the voice assistant (or assistants) of choice, whether that’s Apple’s Siri / HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. At launch, Matter will run on Ethernet Wi-Fi, Thread, and Bluetooth Low Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLRZUM"&gt;Other big companies, like Philips Hue, are on board: the company has already promised to release a simple software update in the coming months that will make all of its past and present products compatible with Matter once it launches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2phxrb"&gt;It’s an ambitious goal, which could vastly simplify the confusing parts of smart home setup — assuming companies are willing to put in the work to issue software updates and integrate the standard into their current and future products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2Mpwn"&gt;As part of the announcement, the Zigbee Alliance (which created the Zigbee standard for interconnected smart home gadgets) has announced that it’ll rename itself to the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) as it expands to focus more on projects like Matter in addition to the existing Zigbee network.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic and Apple are now fighting over a naked banana</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortnite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lNdLJPQSqJo2rjPBXZ9IgS5cIq4=/0x0:1352x901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69266448/Fortnite_20200221130836.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rcoquR"&gt;As the trial for &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; entered its second week, both parties took a break from antitrust law to argue over whether bananas should wear clothes in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBa6N7"&gt;The banana in question is Peely, a humanoid fruit avatar from Epic’s game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, as you may remember, is at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;the center of the huge lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; between Apple and Epic. The trial’s sixth day began with testimony from Matthew Weissinger, Epic’s VP of marketing. And Apple used its cross-examination to offer the court an exhaustive tutorial on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, beginning with its title screen and one of its skins. Hence the banana:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8c9EI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; We have in front of us a new set of images, and what is this screen showing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBv9zJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; This is your matchmaking lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHgS33"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And we have a large yellow banana here, don’t we? In a tuxedo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yumHw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. That is Peely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bj22g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And that’s Peely, did you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRq4aC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJyvjd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And in fact, in the tuxedo, he’s known as Agent Peely, correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyNyik"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHbsrk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; We thought it better to go with the suit than the naked banana, since we are in federal court this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MxYsLF"&gt;Peely’s &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/even-apple-knows-fortnites-peely-is-a-monster-1846860238?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=kotaku"&gt;nightmarish existence&lt;/a&gt; is barely related to Apple’s case. And the “naked banana” comment would probably have passed for a throwaway joke, but for one very important fact: Apple slammed Epic last week by claiming that it hosted porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GyoLNt"&gt;On Friday, an Apple attorney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;went after indie storefront Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, which Epic lets users install through the Epic Games Store. The attorney noted that Itch.io included “so-called adult games” whose descriptions were “not appropriate for us to speak in federal courts,” calling them “both offensive and sexualized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IposXU"&gt;Epic Games Store manager Steven Allison defended Itch.io, but the exchange may have stung Epic. Or at least, that’s the best explanation I can imagine for what happened two hours later — when Epic’s attorney decided to revisit Peely during her own questioning of Weissinger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3LA2Yx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; A little bit of a digression. We talked about Peely? Our banana? Remember that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpltRh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGD6uA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And there might have been an implication that to show Peely without a suit would have been inappropriate. Do you recall that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrFwda"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaZwfn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there anything inappropriate about Peely without a suit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAlVPW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; No, there is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31doiF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; If we could just put on the screen a picture of Peely — is there anything inappropriate about Peely without clothes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hlMm3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s just a banana, ma’am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rso1D4"&gt;This does, somewhat astonishingly, relate to the core issues in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple.&lt;/em&gt; Epic is suing to make Apple open up iOS to alternative app stores like the Epic Games Store. Apple claims this would expose users to malicious and low-quality apps. It used Itch.io to paint Epic as a sloppy guardian of its users’ safety, and Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers seemed to take Apple’s concern at least somewhat seriously. It’s unclear whether Rogers actually thought there was a graphically naked banana-person in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but Epic’s attorney clearly didn’t want to take that chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FXFTR"&gt;But the Peely exchange still epitomized just how rambling and off-topic some of today’s testimony felt. Apple’s tutorial was clearly aimed at showing that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is mostly a game and not an “experience” or “metaverse” — encouraging the judge to weigh the App Store’s game-related policies against similar rules on consoles, rather than scrutinizing the whole iOS ecosystem. Still, the result felt like a college freshman padding an English essay with a blow-by-blow plot summary — or in this case, a blow-by-blow description of how to complete a skydiving challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVWnjH"&gt;And despite Apple and Epic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;often very funny debate&lt;/a&gt; over the definition of a game, the case will probably hinge on drier-sounding questions like those discussed by Epic’s first expert witness, the economist David Evans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zkyo08"&gt;Evans argued that Apple is running an unfair single-brand monopoly: basically, it sells pricey devices that lock users into an ecosystem with no reasonable alternatives for getting certain apps, beyond tossing their phone or tablet and spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on a new one. Developers can offer cheaper in-app purchases on the web or a different platform, but Apple won’t let iOS apps direct users to these savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfE9wV"&gt;Judge Rogers asked some skeptical questions about Evans’ testimony, and Epic will almost certainly try to hammer his points harder. Hopefully, both parties will let Peely slip — but who knows, maybe the banana clothing issue will remain a split in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
