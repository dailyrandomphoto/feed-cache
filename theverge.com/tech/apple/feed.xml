    <title>Apple macOS 12 Monterey review: the best is yet to come</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s fine, but Apple has unfinished business&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8VNIdt"&gt;Downloading &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; was a big change for me — visually, pragmatically, philosophically. It was the biggest macOS redesign we’d seen in years. And it was a new direction for the ecosystem in general; macOS looked and felt like iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlhZcb"&gt;Downloading macOS Monterey, by contrast, has not impacted my life much. I installed the first beta over the summer, forgot that I was using it within a few days, and tried to download it again the following week. It looks like Big Sur, with some tweaks here and there. Many of them seem to be catch-up efforts, equipping Monterey with features that iOS (or competitors) already had. A few of the features are useful for me, but they’re features you have to seek out and set up. And we’re still waiting on some of the most innovative parts of Monterey that Apple announced earlier this year to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWJr5y"&gt;So my ultimate view on this operating system is, “Sure.” It’s a stable release that I’ve been using reliably for a few months. Nothing’s terribly broken. If you’re someone who prefers to exercise maximum caution and wait a while before upgrading, you’re also not missing all that much. As is often the case with releases directly following a major redesign, this is a building year for macOS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A blank MacBook desktop with a purple and pink gradient background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YwmUf3sTHLLQ3b7cz-kKzFHxKc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989814/Image_11_5_21_at_4.27_PM.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the desktop of a MacBook running macOS Monterey. Look familiar?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8x3fR1"&gt;FaceTime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YrJPaX"&gt;The tweaks that Apple seems to be most excited about concern FaceTime. While I won’t go so far as to insinuate that Apple is trying to make FaceTime a Zoom competitor, it’s certainly introduced a number of features aimed at making its service more viable for group calls. The significant one for me is that you can now create links to FaceTime calls (as you can with Zoom calls) and send them out to participants ahead of time. These links are very easy to create with a single button on the app’s home screen — certainly slightly less of a pain than they are in the Zoom client on macOS. (On the other hand, the FaceTime link is just a link; it doesn’t come with dial-in numbers and you can’t join from a landline.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEX1JA"&gt;These links also allow Android and Windows users to join such calls for the first time. Joining a FaceTime call from a Windows laptop is eerily similar to joining a Zoom or Google Meet call — you click the link, the call opens in your browser, you’re asked to enter your name, and you wait around until the host lets you in. Also in the vein of targeting the business market (or, at least, the calls-with-multiple-friends market), FaceTime now supports Grid View, which lays the faces of participants in front of you when you’re on a call (an option &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362323-Adjusting-screen-view-settings-during-a-virtual-meeting"&gt;Zoom also has&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDefNl"&gt;There are a few other neat features that pop up in Control Center, including Portrait Mode (which blurs the background behind you), Voice Isolation (which mitigates background noise while you’re speaking), and Wide Spectrum (which picks up all of your background noise, if you’re doing a virtual guitar lesson or something). Portrait Mode, in particular, works quite well, is easy to toggle on and off, and is something I’ll continue to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user faces the camera on a FaceTime call with their background blurred out. A drop-down menu from the Control Center indicates that Portrait Mode is active." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FSk6luq9rJYUC8aCy6NmdJXDSr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989881/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_4.50.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s FaceTime blurring out my background on a call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oQLqMt"&gt;These features are actually available for third-party apps to support as well, though who supports what seems to vary. I could use Portrait Mode in both Zoom and Google Meet but couldn’t use the microphone controls. I haven’t been able to find a list of apps that support these enhancements, but I have asked Apple for one, and I’ll update this review if they dig anything up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKQeno"&gt;The most exciting new FaceTime feature, though — and the one that could really distinguish it from Zoom and other competitors when it comes to group calls — is still in beta. It’s SharePlay. SharePlay is a service similar to Teleparty, Scener, and Watch Together. It allows you and other people on your FaceTime call to watch or listen to streaming content together by syncing everyone’s video and playback controls. (So we’re both watching &lt;em&gt;Foundation &lt;/em&gt;separately on our own Apple accounts — but when I pause or rewind, your video pauses or rewinds as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of an Apple Music interface. A notification in the top right reads “Music: Content will SharePlay automatically”." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPgYmk2ifvwLjeq3bc4WdznkcVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989957/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.06.00_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you open up a supported service like Apple Music while you’re on a FaceTime call, content SharePlays automatically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDulur"&gt;SharePlay, unfortunately, doesn’t seem ready yet. For one, the official list of services the feature supports isn’t easy to find — I had to get Apple to send me this &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1583059388"&gt;App Store Preview page&lt;/a&gt;. The supported services are also relatively few, and it doesn’t include any non-Apple big players like Hulu, HBO, Netflix, or Spotify yet — which are the services that people I know reliably have. It also doesn’t have Apple’s own Podcast app yet. (It does include Tiktok, which is hilarious.) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;Hulu,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673907/apple-event-2021-apple-tv-plus-streaming-wars"&gt;Spotify and HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; are supposed to be adopting SharePlay at some point, but Apple hasn’t given me a timeline for Podcasts support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtiILL"&gt;That aside, the beta version of SharePlay is a nice experience — when it works. I played a few Apple Music tracks on a group call, and I would say SharePlay worked about 50 percent of the time. It was a good experience, and all parties could pause and skip without issue. But if I changed songs, my fellow callers would often stop hearing the audio I was trying to share and get stuck on a loading screen (while it continued to play on my end), and I’d have to quit and restart the Music app to get us synced up again. All told, I hope that Apple is able to polish SharePlay up before its final release — it still seems to be a beta feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Safari with the sidebar open and The Verge Reviews homepage, with the combined URL and tab bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XtCNXc3f7SGXs-2WzVtY4QRt08Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989960/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.11.56_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s Safari with the combined tab bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Safari with the sidebar open and the Verge Reviews homepage displayed with separate tab and URL bars." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WvI-pHmGIYcgonPYEtwoOqfnf-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989961/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.12.18_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here it is with the two bars separate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VyElJZ"&gt;Safari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xqxfMb"&gt;The latest version of Safari isn’t limited to Monterey — you can install it on Big Sur, too, but Apple tends to update it around the same time that it updates macOS. This year’s edition redesigns the way tabs look — or, at least, it tried to. In the first few Monterey betas, Apple combined Safari’s tab bar and URL bar into a single row. People ended up hating this — the franken-bar was a bit cramped, and it was easy to close tabs instead of selecting them — so Apple has brought back the old, discrete bars for the stable release. The combined tab bar is still an option if you want it — you can swap in Preferences. I encourage you to try both layouts if you’re a Safari user. I actually like the extra browser space that the compact tab layout affords, though it gets a bit unwieldy if you have tons and tons of tabs open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bz36nA"&gt;Apple’s made a few other tweaks to tabs. They look slightly rounder now, and you can hover over one to reveal its full page title and URL. Safari also now has “tab groups” (another feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257446/google-chome-tab-grouping-feature"&gt;Chrome has had for a while&lt;/a&gt;). If you have three tabs open, you can click a little icon in the top-left corner to make them into a tab group. Later on, if you open the sidebar on the left of the Safari window, you’ll see it listed under a “Tab Groups” heading; you can click on it to reopen those three tabs. Also in that sidebar live your bookmarks and your reading list. This is — finally — an area where I think Safari is now a step ahead of Chrome. I’ve always found tab groups in Chrome to be quite confusing and have never used them, but they’re so simple in Safari that I’ve already made them part of my routine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CRIO4"&gt;Tab groups also sync across devices (as do Bookmarks, extensions, etc.), though I had to dig into Settings on all my Apple products and give iCloud permission to do that before it worked. There are also a few new security features, including Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which prevents “known trackers” from viewing your IP address, and HTTPS Upgrade, which automatically switches sites from HTTP to HTTPS when possible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II5wcz"&gt;And then there’s Quick Note. Quick Note ostensibly gives you an easy way to take notes on an article you’re reading — you can right-click highlighted text to add it to a Note, which will then pop back up whenever you return to that web page. I was excited about this when I tried it in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;early betas&lt;/a&gt;, but I never quite got the hang of them and haven’t actually ended up using it. It might be more useful for students who often have to take notes on long readings; I have trouble finding a use case for myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeIQGG"&gt;The new Safari as a whole was quite stable and speedy. Things weren’t randomly crashing or quitting. But the new sidebar, and the ease with which you can operate Tab Groups, has seriously made me consider switching to Safari. It’s surprisingly useful to have bookmarks, tab groups, and my reading list all in one place. If all the Chrome extensions I currently use make it over there, I’ll probably do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwz6ZWtl78JzSglvvF6IjXqYjxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989963/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.15.53_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="faVKTv"&gt;Continuity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Hirq8y"&gt;When I asked Apple if there was any unifying theme or goal behind the big dump of features that is macOS Monterey, the company told me it was meant to further the journey Big Sur began of unifying macOS and iOS. Monterey has a few additions that are clearly meant to do that, though the biggest one isn’t ready yet. Universal Control will allow you to use an iPad as a secondary screen to your Mac, so you can drag / drop files between the two devices and operate them with a single mouse and keyboard. This has been one of the most anticipated Monterey features since the software was announced, but it’s still nowhere in sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxAyVU"&gt;A few other iOS staples have made their way onto macOS Monterey. One is Focus, which allows you to filter notifications based on the task you’re doing. Within Focus preferences, accessible from the Control Center, you can create various Focus profiles for work, gaming, and other scenarios; for each profile, you’ll essentially whitelist applications or contacts that are allowed to send you notifications when that profile is on. You can schedule Focus to turn on automatically at various times, in various locations, or with the opening of various apps, and you can allow people and apps to choose to notify you anyway if something is urgent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wbP1LW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge guide to macOS","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"},{"title":"Apple macOS 11 Big Sur review: a long time coming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="t9AIsE"&gt;This is a feature I really wish I’d had in college — it would’ve been great for turning off social media while writing papers and such. Employed me finds it mostly useful for shutting up Slack after work hours (though you could already do that within the app itself). Switching to Focus in macOS can also switch it on across your iOS devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFdml7GZ791cQIXVPPM4iCAfwH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989971/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.17.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KTRbbe"&gt;Another thing I’ve found surprisingly handy: Shortcuts. Yes, Siri Shortcuts are a thing on Macs now. I barely use these on my iPhone, but I’ve actually found a few of them handy on my MacBook because you can stick them on the menu bar for quick access. In particular, “Split Screen Two Apps” and “Start My Next Meeting” were convenient to have up there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TfmJ4A"&gt;Odds and ends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2oDhp"&gt;Various other apps have gotten updates here and there. There’s a new tab called “Shared With You” in Photos, News, Safari, Apple TV, and Apple Podcasts, which displays media that you’ve recently received in Messages. This feature sounds potentially useful but didn’t actually work for me — nothing was showing up in my Shared With You tabs unless I pinned it. Apple is still trying to figure out what’s going on but tells me it’s not an issue they’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vYJ6P1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS staples have made their way onto macOS Monterey&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FZ9cPU"&gt;Speaking of Messages, if you text someone multiple photos, they’re now displayed as a collage or a stack, depending on how many you send. Sure. It’s cute. The app also displays a new button next to the photos you receive, which you can click to quickly save those photos to your device. Again, sure. It’s now slightly easier to save photos (though it wasn’t that hard before). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Wtn1h2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10848592"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T61d0j"&gt;You can now tag your Notes, which is such a no-brainer I’m surprised it took Apple this long to implement it. Just type a hashtag followed by a word anywhere in the note in question, and it’ll show up as a tag in a “Tag Browser” on the left sidebar. Useful! I will use these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPgeSs"&gt;Elsewhere, Apple seems to be trying to push Notes towards a similar vein to Google Docs. There are a number of new features that smooth out the process of collaborating on Notes in iCloud. You can now type an @ to get a friend’s attention within a Note and can see a summary of updates to shared Notes in a new Activity View. These things I’m not sure about — I already use Docs for the purpose Notes is moving towards here, and the former is still much more full-featured, not to mention more widely accessible outside of Apple’s ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdrK5k"&gt;Maps, finally, has received what Apple says is its largest update yet. The main thing you’ll notice is that zooming all the way out reveals a cute interactive globe floating in space. You can click and drag to spin it around, and there are little details for mountains, rainforests, and such. When I say cute, I mean cute — it’s somewhat cartoonish and not like using Google Earth. But it’s neat to play around with, and I’ve had fun dropping pins in random places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wym9hn"&gt;More pragmatically, city layouts have gotten more useful. Zoom in on San Francisco, and you’ll see icons over the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Fisherman’s Wharf, Oracle Park, etc. Click those icons, and little cards pop up with basically all the information you might need about these destinations: hours, accessibility information, phone numbers, addresses, etc. I have actually started using Maps to plan trips instead of Google Maps because of these cards — I much prefer the card layout to having the information pop up in the sidebar like it does on Google. It takes up less space on the screen and doesn’t move everything else around when you open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Apple maps viewing Manhattan, with Grand Central Terminal’s information card selected." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hV-g8rXlmkH_0f28Y-E7sisSVLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989991/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.22.27_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neat!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kydzj7"&gt;Should you upgrade?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ozx1H9"&gt;Sure, with the caveat that waiting a few weeks to download this stuff is always the safest course of action. For what it’s worth, Apple seems to have ironed out most of the bugs I saw in early betas, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765759/apple-macos-monterey-t2-security-brick-bug"&gt;just released a patch&lt;/a&gt; to fix some upgrade headaches with older Macs. It’s also worth bearing in mind that two of the most anticipated parts of this operating system — SharePlay and Universal Control — aren’t ready yet. Other folks who are particularly cautious about bugs may want to sift through the new features and figure out which ones will benefit their lives. There may be some, and there may not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fm1SuQ"&gt;Here’s what those features are for me: Portrait Mode, Safari Tab Groups, Shortcuts, Notes tags, and the new cards in Maps. None of these things have changed the way I observe or interact with macOS, but they’re all handy things that not all competitors have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Notes app in macOS Monterey. The not reads “Here is a new note, #newnote. That was easy.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86sAZRm9X8k_GkUe6-YC7Ggu92I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22990000/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.24.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure, why not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4bN2c6"&gt;They are, I will note, also all things that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;also exist in iOS&lt;/a&gt;. In my review of macOS Big Sur, I noted that many of the port-overs from iOS weren’t as beneficial on a non-touchscreen laptop as they were on a phone. macOS Monterey is a more incremental step ahead, which is to be expected the year after a major redesign. But I think Apple has also done a better job this year of pinpointing the sorts of iOS features that make sense to have on a Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiKJDy"&gt;With that said, macOS Monterey isn’t finished (despite a rather lengthy beta period), and I think there are still plenty of people who will upgrade and find little to no change to their macOS experience. That may be the case until SharePlay and Universal Control are ready to take the stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="LclBBY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10848602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Netflix will reportedly make games available via the App Store on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ro84Ro2U8gA3HdKD5gpspEoUVI=/81x0:879x532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70108589/Screen_Shot_2021_11_02_at_1.24.40_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uKpxIa"&gt;Earlier this month, Netflix officially got into gaming by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;rolling out a mobile game service for Android users&lt;/a&gt;. While Netflix says that it's working on an iOS version of the service, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;tech reporter Mark Gurman says that Apple’s App Store policies will prevent Netflix from making games available from its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RS4ih"&gt;Apple bars third-party apps from functioning as a hub for games, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;become a point of contention with cloud gaming services&lt;/a&gt; like Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Google Stadia. Cloud gaming services can only get around this by offering their games through a web app, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589398/facebook-cloud-gaming-web-app-launch-apple"&gt;just like Facebook has already done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RUev3O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple will need to change its rules or grant Netflix an exemption”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsebeq"&gt;According to Gurman’s latest &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter, Netflix will tiptoe around Apple’s rules by making its games available via the App Store. This means that games won’t be downloadable or playable from the Netflix app — you’ll only be able to launch them from there. The service currently functions in this way on Android; the games are neatly packaged in a dedicated tab on the Netflix app, but are downloaded individually from the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWXEa6"&gt;While this setup is fine, it isn’t ideal for an all-in-one gaming service. Users should be able to download and play games from within the service itself. That’s why Gurman predicts that Netflix will eventually bring its games to the cloud. Again, this would work fine for Android, but Apple’s policies make it nearly impossible for cloud gaming to thrive, forcing services to settle for measly web apps. If and when Netflix decides to embrace cloud gaming, it’s unclear what will happen to the service on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dm6jE"&gt;“Apple will need to change its rules or grant Netflix an exemption,” Gurman says. “That leaves the ultimate success of Netflix’s service in the hands of Apple, a longtime partner but also a growing rival.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s handy AirTag Loop is selling for a low price at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4RdZRLPH6sD6sTOhez3BP5gSK_o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104691/vpavic_4547_20210421_0070.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now buy an AirTag Loop for $24 from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o0ereY"&gt;iPhone owners planning on traveling or making lots of plans this holiday season may find today’s AirTag Loop deal useful. Right now at Amazon, you can buy the handy loop made specifically to carry Apple’s ultrawideband-capable Bluetooth tracker at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932PL9BF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an all-time low price of around $24&lt;/a&gt; instead of $29. This deal is valid on the orange or deep navy colorways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgirnc"&gt;Other colors are also on sale, but are selling for a little more. You can pick up the white or yellow variants for $26, for example. Given that AirTags lack a lanyard hole of their own (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;a very Apple move&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll need a loop to securely attach them to backpacks, keys, and other items. So, while you might be buying one a little begrudgingly, but you’ll probably be happy you have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k18Xy5"&gt;Note, however, we have seen the deep navy AirTag loop plunge to as low as $19 on Adorama about a month ago, so there’s a possibility that other retailers may offer deeper discounts as we approach Black Friday. We’ll keep you updated on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Guide to Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NXz5v8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="MasfmJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795285"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rzgh35"&gt;You can take great photos and video clips on your next trip while saving money thanks to today’s great deal on the newest GoPro action camera. Normally $500, Amazon and B&amp;amp;H are selling the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F6%2F22765943%2Fapple-airtag-hitman-3-gopro-hero-10-black-xbox-elite-series-2-controller-amazon-omni-fire-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero 10 Black&lt;/a&gt; for $450 instead. This GoPro Hero camera boasts all the amazing features its predecessor, which we called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;“biggest, baddest action camera out there,”&lt;/a&gt; and then some. What’s new here includes a new processor, which allows higher frame rates and increased resolution capture. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22675730/gopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWZLEC"&gt;If that’s a little out of your budget, the 2020 GoPro Hero 9 is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=45&amp;amp;imprToken=ccbe78d2-1dd2-46cf-f21&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22527411%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $350 — the biggest price drop we’ve seen for this model as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uYWoph"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YBmkuO"&gt;Xbox owners can now buy the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller for its best price yet. We once dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;“the best Xbox controller&lt;/a&gt;” when it was released in 2019, and you can now get it for $139 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; instead of $180, and $140 at &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/Jr4gqN"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Felite-wireless-controller-series-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yPT3S"&gt;The Series 2 makes it easy to customize buttons and analog sticks, while the built-in, rechargeable battery should last for up to 40 hours on a single charge. Wrap-around grips also make the controller easier to hold, while other highlights include adjustable-tension thumbsticks and support for both USB-C and Bluetooth. It’s compatible with the Xbox Series X / S consoles, as well as the Xbox One and Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RymyvK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10763457"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NEA3gO"&gt;If you’d rather pick up one of the best 2021 video games, Target’s also offering up to 60 percent off &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/XxOzzg"&gt;select video games&lt;/a&gt; for Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles through Saturday, November 6th. One of these deals includes 50 percent off Hitman 3, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252511/hitman-3-review-io-interactive-accessible-storytelling-end-series"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called “the most accessible, cohesive Hitman game to date.” Right now, Target is selling both the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fhitman-3-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-81819812&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fhitman-3-xbox-series-x-xbox-one%2F-%2FA-81819804&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X / S and Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; versions for $25 instead of $50. RedCard members can also get an extra five percent off, lowering the price to about $23.75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FuwxIK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848465"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="SWAhw2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848480"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V23L6Y"&gt;Those in the market for an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"&gt;affordable 4K TV&lt;/a&gt; may be interested to know Amazon is now offering the first discounts yet on its new Omni Fire TV and Fire TV 4-Series models. You can save $150 on both the $560 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt; and $510 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; Omni Fire TV models, paying $410 and $360 instead, respectively. The 4K TV works with Alexa and it additionally provides access to major streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and more without extra hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwlKZ2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TUaEfP"&gt;Meanwhile, Amazon’s also taking $140 off of the lower-end &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; Fire TV 4-Series editions. The larger-sized model usually costs $520, but it now costs $380. The 50-inch version usually costs $470, but now sells for $330. The 4K Ultra HD TV also supports HDR 10 and HLG and comes with a Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TqwABC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848646"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AmI8sT"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other noteworthy deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="11FzxK"&gt;Amazon is selling its new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet/dp/B08BX7FV5L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 10 tablet&lt;/a&gt; for $100 instead of $150 — an all-time low — when you buy the 32GB version. You can also get an extra 20 percent off when you trade in select devices toward the purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wg8t8q"&gt;Readers can pick up a pair of Bose’s 2017 QuietComfort 35 Series II noise-canceling headphones, which can seamlessly switch between two paired devices, for $180 instead of $299 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756CYWWD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Apple hires Tesla’s former Autopilot software director</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMqCseHCSAz0pNx9aaB2OkGI4uA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104568/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B7dFWx"&gt;Apple hasn’t been all that vocal about its electric car project, but according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-05/apple-hires-tesla-s-autopilot-software-director-for-car-effort?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone maker is hiring Tesla’s Autopilot software engineer to work on its EVs. Sources close to the matter told&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that Apple scooped up Christopher “CJ” Moore to work on its self-driving software. He’ll report to &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3649749-apple-said-to-picked-up-ex-tesla-exec-for-electric-car-push"&gt;Stuart Bowers, another Tesla ex-pat&lt;/a&gt; who previously served as the vice president of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrhHAb"&gt;During his time at Tesla, Moore stirred up controversy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"&gt;for calling CEO Elon Musk’s “full self-driving” claims exaggerated&lt;/a&gt;. In January, Musk stated that he was “highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year.” The full self-driving software, currently in beta, does not make a Tesla vehicle fully autonomous, as a driver must keep control of the vehicle at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kx5jcF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Moore stirred up controversy for calling CEO Elon Musk’s “full self-driving” claims an exaggeration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mtJrr"&gt;Moore pointed out that Tesla is currently at Level 2, referring to the vehicle’s level of autonomy — Level 2 means that the car still requires supervision from the driver, while Level 5 signifies full autonomy. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/tesla-engineer-who-quit-wanted-as-witness-in-key-autopilot-trial?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Moore has since been called as a witness&lt;/a&gt; to the fiery Tesla crash in April that left two people dead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;Initial reports suggested&lt;/a&gt; there was no one in the driver’s seat, but the National Transportation Safety Board &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/ntsb-driver-seat-occupied-in-fatal-tesla-crash-in-spring-texas.html"&gt;said last month that its investigation showed&lt;/a&gt; the driver’s seat was occupied in that incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKQEAs"&gt;Apple’s electric car project, codenamed Project Titan, remains shrouded in secrecy. We do know, however, that Apple has been hiring EV experts from other companies — especially Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qElJsF"&gt;After Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;hired away the head of Apple’s car project, Doug Field&lt;/a&gt;, Apple replaced him with former Adobe CTO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;Apple Watch executive Kevin Lynch&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;hired Ulrich Kranz, the co-founder of Canoo&lt;/a&gt; who helped BMW on its i3 and i8 programs. Apple previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/17/18144421/apple-designer-andrew-kim-tesla-microsoft-xbox-one-s-hololens"&gt;poached designer Andrew Kim from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, along with Tesla’s drive systems &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/22/apple-tesla-engineering-vp-hire/"&gt;expert Michael Schwekutsch and car interiors/exteriors engineering vice president Steve MacManus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $850.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult, especially with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; just on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744497/macos-12-monterey-apple-mac-download-available-now"&gt;recently-released macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; — and we’ll highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5M7S6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $900. The $1,249 512GB configuration is also on sale in all three colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,150, its second-best price to date. These deals can come and go quickly, though, but we expect more to come as the holiday shopping season draws near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xStRiT"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; last month, the company introduced a new M1 line of CPUs as well as updates to both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros. There are multiple variants of both models, though, we haven’t seen any noteworthy discounts on any configuration yet outside of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQSLL92?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s $50 discount on the 14-inch model&lt;/a&gt;. But with the largest shopping event of the year just around the corner, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KS0G3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"2021 MacBook Pros compared: how Apple’s laptops stack up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733406/macbook-pro-13-14-16-inch-m1-max-air-compare-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="h4rH4i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the latest MacBook Pro line were absolutely beaming with praise. Whether it was the beautiful display or the remarkable performance and battery life they exhibited, these premium laptops are investments that we can wholeheartedly recommend. As soon as there's a price break on these impressive laptops, we’d suggest that anyone in the market for a new laptop consider purchasing one, as they’re likely to move fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oXGxIx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AOJENT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The Touch Bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s geared more toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for nearly $200 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,100. The larger, 512GB variant is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $1,349, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch, mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older, Intel-powered device features four Thunderbolt ports, Windows bootcamp-ready Ice Lake processors, the current scissor-switch keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in several configurations at Amazon, including one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999 and one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,500, which is almost $500 off the list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the last-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 is still on sale, but has been outpaced in nearly every category with the release of the new MacBook Pros that use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs&lt;/a&gt;. However, you can still grab the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWiTGrpT1N" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,299 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of that, deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $649&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $750&lt;/a&gt;. Costco members can also &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-512gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694240.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase the 512GB model for the same price&lt;/a&gt;, though, no other retailers are offering the discount.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fixes bug that could cause macOS Monterey to brick Macs with a T2 security chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Apple MacBook Air" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6_98URhHffSHEz69GzapRBq7IU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102063/vpavic_4291_20201113_0411.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6z6zGs"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744497/macos-12-monterey-apple-mac-download-available-now"&gt;macOS Monterey was released&lt;/a&gt;, there have been several Apple users who said that installing the update bricked their computers. It was unclear what might have caused the issue until today, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1456672355992866816"&gt;Rene Ritchie reports&lt;/a&gt;, he has received this statement from Apple citing an issue with the firmware of its T2 security chip (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/05/apple-rolls-out-fix-for-macos-monterey-bug-that-bricked-some-macs-with-the-t2-chip/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="V2k1Qg"&gt;We have identified and fixed an issue with the firmware on the Apple T2 security chip that prevented a very small number of users from booting up their Mac after updating macOS. The updated firmware is now included with the existing macOS updates. Any users impacted by this issue can contact Apple Support for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0xVEQS"&gt;There aren’t any specifics on the models affected, possible settings or configurations that are vulnerable, or exactly what a “small number of users” adds up to. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/macos-monterey-bricking-older-macs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was able to find tweets from at least nine MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac owners who said their devices didn’t boot up after the update. It’s good that they can reach out to Apple Support for assistance, but it’s also unclear if those people will be able to retain any data locked in affected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wanj1N"&gt;The T2 security chip has appeared in a number of Apple computers (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862"&gt;you can check the list here&lt;/a&gt;) since it was introduced in 2018. Apple says that updated firmware to eliminate the issue is now included in existing macOS updates (some trackers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iOSReleases/status/1456669546945916935"&gt;noted a refreshed version of the BridgeOS 6.0 software&lt;/a&gt; that runs on the T2 going out today), so it shouldn’t be an issue on any of those machines from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Dr. Brain is a bold, genre-bending thriller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="dr. brain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdSPZb0E9B9NJVm_kU2J-QnyLwI=/694x0:3147x1635/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70100297/Dr_Brain_Photo_010302.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A decent Korean original series debut for the platform, helmed by a seasoned director&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Z1rZU1"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; stumbles through its world-building at times, there is something deeply bold and profoundly ambitious in this first Korean original series on Apple TV Plus. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; takes off as a six-episode thriller starring Lee Sun-kyun (of &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; fame) as neuroscientist Dr. Koh Se-won. It’s an encouraging start for the streamer’s Korean debut, though the show doesn’t quite deliver on the promise of its fascinating premise and excellent cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFxyyD"&gt;We are first introduced to Dr. Koh as a young kid on the autism spectrum, struggling to understand emotions and relate to others. He is unfortunately labeled as a problem child in school, which becomes an enormous burden for his single mother. Bringing him to doctors, the (exorbitant) treatments offered don’t quite seem to work the way she hopes for. Growing up with a propensity to “take things apart to see what is inside,” Dr. Koh dives into brain research, which allows him to study the human mind and get a glimpse of how others experience the world. Presenting his research and experiments at conferences, he is portrayed as a relatively successful scientist — albeit one whose ideas are unsettling to his peers. This introduction then takes a dark, abrupt turn as Dr. Koh suffers a series of horrific personal tragedies in quick succession. Increasingly desperate to unearth what happened, he personally tests his research by undergoing “brain syncs” with the dead to pry open their memories for clues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8N3TH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; is a genre-bending piece of work, dancing between crime thriller, science fiction, and, most poignantly, a family drama. The series’ best work is in its portrait of grief, sketching Dr. Koh’s private moments as ones of anguish and gradual reckoning with his own flaws and missteps. There is a saying in academia that all research is in some part autobiographical and this rings true for Dr. Koh. His “brain sync” research becomes both a form of mourning and a type of searching, as he realizes that there is something more sinister behind the tragedies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="XHDPrQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eB9PW65kWFo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbU7oN"&gt;Lee Sun-kyun delivers an appropriately reserved performance, getting the balance just right between playing an aloof neuroscientist and a traumatized, bereaved man seeking answers. His colleague, Dr. Hong Nam-il (Lee Jae-won), blossoms over the series, portraying a depth of character that far outdoes what the script offers him. As police officer Lieutenant Choi, Seo Ji-hye (from the immensely popular &lt;em&gt;Crash Landing On You&lt;/em&gt;) offers a refreshing steadiness throughout the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wg7MNB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s Foundation starts out big, lavish, and a little boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"},{"title":"Apple’s latest sci-fi drama Invasion starts out too dang slow","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OgTp33"&gt;There are unshakeable marks of &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; echoing through the six episodes, as characters wander through altered realities and layers of consciousness. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;is most intriguing when its characters are unsure whether other people they are seeing are real or figments from a glitchy brain sync. Although the show fumbles through the details of the brain sync mechanism, the central story of Dr. Koh’s search for truth and redemption is resoundingly coherent. Which makes it all the more disappointing that the more philosophical explorations in &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; — on neurodiversity, ethics in brain research, and the concept of the self — are half-baked. Additionally, its treatment of female characters feels disconcertingly underdeveloped. They’re often left with little agency, abruptly enter and exit the narrative, and are ultimately relegated as untidy footnotes. With its uneven pace over six episodes, there is a gnawing sense that &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;could have been truly great if its supporting characters and theories were more deeply fleshed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irGFjO"&gt;For example, though it never examines this fully, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;hints at some of the most complex moral dilemmas in technology that we’re really only beginning to truly interrogate. It is gravely disturbing to see Dr. Koh lurking around the morgue to find a corpse to test out his brain sync technology or hook himself up with a cat (!!) in the name of (hopefully) solving a crime. There is a fine balance between being a user of technology and being used by technology. Here is where the concept of brain syncs in the show carries some real-life parallels. How much of ourselves do we share via technology — and do we even have control over what and how much is shared? What does privacy mean in this digital age? Can the methods of technological advancement be justified as long as the outcomes are “good”? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dr. Brain" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnTuAzAMvTWXfCYSFw9JFSheX0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988263/ATV_Dr_Brain_Photo_010104.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfcGtw"&gt;These questions are all the more poignant given the fact that the show is backed by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. There is perhaps a meta-critique here somewhere about the relationship between Apple and its users and whether our lives have really been made better by its products. Perhaps the conclusion that the show offers us is one of stubborn ambivalence toward technology: Dr. Koh’s use of brain sync technology (somewhat ironically) allows him to experience the richness of life, in all of its emotions, joys and sorrows, more than he ever could without it. Yet, this comes at a cost. He sometimes suffers from an information overload and his personality changes when reality and technology start to blur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqzmld"&gt;Seasoned writer-director Kim Jee-woon has helmed critically acclaimed Korean classics like &lt;em&gt;The Good, The Bad, The Weird&lt;/em&gt; (2008) and Korea’s first Warner Brothers-funded film &lt;em&gt;The Age of Shadows&lt;/em&gt; (2016). There are flashes of brilliance throughout the series, particularly in its seamless, well-timed use of flashbacks — a storytelling tool that too often feels abused nowadays. On one level, his sleek transitions between past and present fittingly capture the unsettled mind of Dr. Koh. On another, these shifts in time provide an absorbingly suspenseful experience for the viewer, especially in the last few episodes. This works in the show’s favor, as Apple TV Plus will drop episodes of &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; one at a time, weekly through December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3jFg09"&gt;Based on the popular Korean webtoon of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; premiered on November 4th, coinciding with Apple TV Plus’ launch in the Korean market. Though Dr. Brain might feel like a slow start for Apple, it is perhaps helpful to remember that not too long ago, Netflix debuted its first Korean original series &lt;em&gt;Love Alarm&lt;/em&gt; to rather disappointing, less-than-illustrious reviews. However, the platform has since developed a prolific portfolio of Korean shows winning both critical and commercial acclaim, most notably with the breakout success of &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;. Despite its shortcomings, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; offers a promising, hopeful glimpse of Apple TV Plus’ vision for its future projects in Korea and a veritable challenge to other streamers in the market. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;If you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932FH25J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWafjgPfUw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the 512GB, Wi-Fi version of the latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for its lowest price yet. Normally $1,399, the retailer is selling it for $1,249 instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this the best and nicest iPad out there. Powered by Apple’s M1 processor, the 2021 iPad Pro is a speed demon and it comes with features like Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, Apple Pencil support, as well as Face ID unlocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fd91ge"&gt;As we noted yesterday, if you’re looking for something cheaper and smaller, Apple’s 2021 11-inch iPad Pro (128GB, Wi-Fi) is also on sale, selling for $699 instead of $799 at at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVKgWMaDgM?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22527112%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fgood-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YtmtDj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845841"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Normally around $1,300 while on sale, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F324842746233%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22763370%2Fapple-ipad-pro-macbook-gopro-hero-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a four-year accidental extended warranty. Better yet, after you purchase, &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15376480-48-lg-oled48c1pub-4k-smart-oled-tv-100-ebay-credit-4-year-accidental-warranty-w-burn-in-coverage-1099-free-s-h-at-ebay?src=frontpage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says that your account will be credited $100, so it’s like getting the TV for $1,000 flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="laDMPh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PmOWsR"&gt;You can also save hundreds on an Intel-powered Apple laptop, if you’d prefer one over an iPad today. And even though it doesn’t come with the M1 processor, it’s still a fast, powerful MacBook in its own right. Right now, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mid-2020 13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 16GB RAM, a 1TB SSD, four Thunderbolt ports, and a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor for $1,500 instead of $1,999. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we praised this MacBook Pro’s keyboard and build quality, calling it a “competent, dependable laptop.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2O5aOt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10846203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8VKBXx"&gt;For Android users who are eager to snag a folding phone, Amazon has a great deal on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3. Released just a few months ago in August, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 touts a more durable screen than its predecessors, with 120Hz refresh rate displays, support for the S Pen, and IPX8 water resistance. Its main drawback, usually, is that it can be very expensive, but today’s deal shaving $200 off makes it more affordable. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097CMYTLD?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is the selling the 256GB foldable phone for $1,600&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HGBG94S?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For $80 extra&lt;/a&gt;, you can also add an S Pen case to your order. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TKYAPK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lDfUD"&gt;Best Buy is taking $200 off of one of the best Chromebooks you can buy, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $529 for the previous-gen model with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of SSD storage, and an Intel 10th Gen Core i3 processor, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it now for $329&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found this Chromebook outperforms many others when it comes to features, build quality, and performance. Although it lacks Intel’s 11th Gen processor and Thunderbolt 4 support, we found that it boasts slightly better battery life than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEq0RM"&gt;However, if you’d prefer the latest version with an Intel Evo-certified 11th Gen Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and Thunderbolt 4 support, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfM3aomFXkf?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling that&lt;/a&gt; one for $529 instead of $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8hwmpR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PKPznw"&gt;If you’re going on an adventurous vacation soon and want to take great photos and video clips, check out this GoPro Hero 9 deal. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; last year, we called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 GoPro Hero 9&lt;/a&gt; the “biggest, baddest action camera out there.” The portable action camera is capable of capturing 5K video and 23.6-megapixel photos, and it can also be used to record in a variety of settings, including underwater. Right now, the GoPro Hero 9 is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVPVzIXaMN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $350, the biggest price drop we’ve seen for this model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ElvxWm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10332746"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="seU8L7"&gt;Best Buy is taking $100 off of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVSQ4vPqZp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s 32-inch UltraGear QHD Nano IPS display&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $500, you can buy the gaming monitor for $400 instead. This monitor features thin bezels and a 16:9 aspect ratio with a sharp 2560 x 1440 resolution. It’s fast, boasting a 165Hz refresh rate with a 1ms response time, and it’s also compatible with Nvidia’s G-Sync adaptive sync technologies. We might see slightly lower prices come Black Friday, but those who are in the market for a capable 32-inch gaming market should check this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SEwZtz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10846505"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9u2IVi"&gt;PC or Xbox gamers can now now enjoy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription&lt;/a&gt; for $38 instead of $45 when they buy it off of Amazon. With the subscription, you can get access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, EA Play titles, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, for a multitude of devices. This deal is particularly good for existing subscribers as you can use it to add three months to your existing subscription. Eneba’s also selling a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;ued=https://www.eneba.com/us/xbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global/best-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; for $29, but that price often fluctuates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IudFYC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IycHjK"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other notable deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vFXq8N"&gt;You can pick up &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G8WTNVR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s official iPhone 13 Pro MagSafe leather cases&lt;/a&gt; for $50 instead of $59. This deal only applies to the green and purple colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="title"&gt;Amazon is selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Con-LR-Neon-PinkNeon-Green/dp/B078GZM4H8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s Joy-Con controllers&lt;/a&gt; for $69 instead of their typical $80 when you buy the neon pink and neon green bundle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9qe09g"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZJ64WD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first generation of Amazon’s Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; sandstone-colored smart display is selling for $45 instead of $60. You can get an additional 25 percent off when you trade in select devices as well. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements break Face ID unless you can microsolder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Em6G6QkVUlMXgnMLI0x9rZq4sSY=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096270/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSNvSN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 lineup might pack a lot of new features, but they now have a major restriction that makes it much harder for independent repair shops to replace broken screens. If you try to swap the screen, Face ID just won’t work — that is, unless you know how to microsolder and can successfully move a tiny microcontroller from the original screen to a new one, as detailed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22764251%2Fiphone-13-screen-replacements-break-face-id-microsolder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an article from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPfobS"&gt;The change makes a very common replacement much more difficult for independent repair shops that may rely on screen repairs as a significant part of their business. Authorized Apple shops apparently don’t run into the problem, as they have access to software that “can make an iPhone 13 accept a new screen with a few clicks,” according to &lt;em&gt;iFixit.&lt;/em&gt; But many indie shops aren’t part of Apple’s official Independent Repair Provider program, which reportedly has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;invasive terms&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them to have to try and find a way to repair iPhone screens on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDUwr1"&gt;If you want to see just how involved the microcontroller switch is, check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MXlhsThmM"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from iCorrect. The repair is a multi-stage process that looks to take some time and require special equipment. And it’s almost certainly impossible for most iPhone owners to try it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rni2SA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9MXlhsThmM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WmnXtR"&gt;Apple has steadily been pushing people away from repairs done by indie shops through ominous warnings shown after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776965/iphone-xs-max-xr-battery-service-third-party-repair"&gt;battery swaps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884287/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-display-screen-replacement-verification-warning"&gt;screen replacements&lt;/a&gt; for some iPhones. But the situation with Face ID breaking on an iPhone 13 means that people who want a screen repair don’t have many great options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu0v2F"&gt;An authorized repair &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;can be expensive&lt;/a&gt;, as is paying for AppleCare Plus for &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/support/products/iphone/"&gt;reduced screen repair prices&lt;/a&gt;. But when the alternatives include finding an indie shop that has the capability to pull off the delicate microcontroller swap, getting a screen replacement but sacrificing Face ID, or just living with a broken screen, paying up for an authorized repair might feel like the best option, even if it is the worst for your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFfgB9"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will start phasing out mask requirements for US retail store customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask is seen outside an Apple retail store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-grsg9Sg0X49OeTVZzFNyDnb4QQ=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095412/1232558252.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple is reportedly going to lift mask requirements for customers at some of its retail stores in the US. | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I0ozwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning to begin ending mask requirements for customers at some of its US retail stores as early as Friday (via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;). The company told employees about the change in an internal memo on Thursday,&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported, saying the decision was based on a decline in coronavirus cases and a rise in vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVxdeW"&gt;Like many companies with multiple locations, Apple has changed its masking requirements for customers more than once since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic last year. In March 2020, the company closed most of its retail stores &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;as the virus spread&lt;/a&gt;. It began reopening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;some US stores in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with many offering only curbside service and not allowing customers inside. Most stores that did open to customers conducted temperature checks and required customers and employees to wear masks. Apple began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;reopening all its US retail stores in March 2021&lt;/a&gt; as vaccines became more widely available and eased mask requirements for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement"&gt;customers in June&lt;/a&gt; as vaccination rates began to rise, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598686/apple-retail-stores-mask-mandate-requirement"&gt;reinstate them in July&lt;/a&gt; as COVID-19 cases surged once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESRxKQ"&gt;The latest memo states that the updated mask policy will apply to retail customers at more than 100 of Apple’s 270 US stores and will be the same for vaccinated and unvaccinated customers. Mask requirements for Apple retail employees will remain in place, however, and will continue for customers in areas where local governments still require indoor masking. The company added that it will “continue to monitor local guidance and Covid data” throughout the coming holiday season and adjust as conditions warrant, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAiyqz"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
