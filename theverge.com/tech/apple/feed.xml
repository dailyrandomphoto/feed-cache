    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. There are currently three models to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4vnkg"&gt;The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. The three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E67sPx"&gt;Regardless of which model you choose, all three models support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at the Watch SE, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. But for those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6p1Qub"&gt;The best deal right now on the Apple Watch SE 40mm with GPS, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-aluminum%2F-%2FA-81498739%3Fpreselect%3D80606314%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$250 at Target&lt;/a&gt;. This configuration is also on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=8352f50c4c29885a93610962debcab11&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$269 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900256762314827" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get two years of PlayStation Plus for only $60 today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D5c3ng-nWdTqNlaVSdKfNNMK_i4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528952/vpavic_4261_20201023_0104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5b53xh"&gt;I always enjoy this time of the year. Usually, I take some time off of work and use it as a golden opportunity to tackle my ever-growing backlog of games. With the year wrapping up and a ton of great games already available (and even more coming over the next few years), it’s truly a great time to be a gamer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYuaN0"&gt;Today’s deals spotlight an incredible deal for PS4 and PS5 owners, a sale on Dell’s 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor, plus a few deals on some great headphones and wireless earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHdAxM"&gt;Get two years of PlayStation Plus for less than $60&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1npEWm"&gt;If you were one of the lucky ones to grab a PS5, I recommend taking advantage of this &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states%3Fadmitad_uid%3De32d8d2030532f7c716099ec07a158f2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus subscription deal, which is $32&lt;/a&gt; at Eneba.com. However, if you want the most bang for your buck, I strongly advise picking up two one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions. You can get it for $60 by using code &lt;strong&gt;DECEMBERPLUS&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This is a great deal, considering one-year of PlayStation Plus when purchased through a retailer like Sony is $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6mJZw"&gt;This is a great price if you want online multiplayer, free monthly games, and access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital compilation of “generation-defining” PS4 games available exclusively for PS5 users with an active PlayStation Plus membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1PkT7"&gt;And yes, this membership will still work on PS4 consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="57p3e9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vUaxRi"&gt;Grab a 27-inch Dell 1440p gaming monitor for $450&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TfrSK0"&gt;If you recently upgraded your PC gaming rig to deliver a 1440p resolution gaming experience and need a monitor to support the higher resolution, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-27-gaming-monitor-s2721dgf%2Fapd%2F210-axeh%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories%3FAID%3D4485850%26cjevent%3D1604740b406c11eb83c600aa0a240614%26gacd%3D9694607-23736398-5750457-266319267-127795103%26dgc%3Daf%26VEN1%3D12578053-4485850-162f05da406c11eba4e79633568f93140INT%26dclid%3DCOHZjoKQ1e0CFcnmKAUdgZcBwA#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s S2721DGF gaming monitor is down to $450&lt;/a&gt; (usually $610) on the company’s direct website. This monitor supports Nvidia G-Sync, includes a 16:9 aspect ratio IPS panel, and supports HDR400 with a 98 percent DCI-P3 color gamut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Tiuch"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10232615"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="71kLdg"&gt;Save $100 on Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rPuSg7"&gt;If you want a comfortable pair of noise-canceling headphones and are okay with spending a pretty penny for better sound quality, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;Sennheiser’s third-generation Momentum Wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; are excellent. Over at Amazon, you can get these wireless headphones for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B07VW98ZKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b205e0761da348f87244cc7c77f67222&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 in black&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B08B3MJBW8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=84f04a510180642cbea1d89730b0446b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kBHDvs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9636852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oahnAZ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are under $200 (again) at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bXlgAF"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/25/21719200/apple-airpods-pros-black-friday-deal-sale-walmart"&gt;not the lowest price&lt;/a&gt; we have seen Apple’s flagship wireless earbuds go, but getting these for under $200 is still a great bargain. The AirPods Pro are on sale at a few places, but &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-19" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the lowest right now is $190 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an active Amazon Prime membership, you can get free shipping. &lt;/p&gt;

The article has been updated to reflect this change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-822" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6-IseMU-VKzo5xzTTBT8BVk65z1R7t_lZHR-ApDuYug7wocNVuNr-RoCuiUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $125 or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725261146929567782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724675251539044953" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6z1zgThWDp2tf3j60kOubPIybm5uNl4EBzedCsO2Rm4cjFVJV1QJbxoCUaAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-348" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The best deal right now is at Woot, which has Apple’s flagship earbuds for $190. If that deal sells out, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fapple-airpods-pro-mwp22am-a-in-the-ear-bluetooth-headset-white%2Fproduct_24422954&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Facebook hits back at Apple with second critical newspaper ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jA6SMOOBNT1JjSdmhNArjUS-Vog=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68527690/facebooknewspaperad2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s second newspaper ad.&lt;/em&gt; | Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CNoEI3"&gt;Facebook is stepping up its campaign against Apple’s privacy changes with a second full-page newspaper ad today. This new ad claims Apple’s iOS 14 privacy changes “will change the internet as we know it,” and force websites and blogs “to start charging you subscription fees” or add in-app purchases due to a lack of personalized ads. It follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;similar full-page newspaper ad&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag8glr"&gt;Apple is planning to make changes to iOS 14 early next year that will require developers to ask for permission to gather data and track users across mobile apps and websites on an iPhone or iPad. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple revealed&lt;/a&gt; how iOS 14 users will be prompted to opt into tracking in apps this week, noting that developers like Facebook can explain to users why they should allow tracking within the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/427F9SagLFMdWvLHnnL25eM5sTY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176650/FB_ATT_Prompt.001.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS 14 privacy prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BMjwm4"&gt;These changes will impact Facebook’s lucrative ad business, but the social networking giant is framing them as something far larger that could impact small businesses. Unsurprisingly, Apple doesn’t agree. “We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;said an Apple spokesperson&lt;/a&gt; in response to Facebook’s first full-page newspaper ad yesterday. “Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYDTCA"&gt;Facebook clearly isn’t holding back on its PR campaign, with this latest newspaper ad trying to sway readers that Apple’s changes are more about moving websites and apps into a paid model where Apple stands to benefit from in-app purchases and subscriptions. With full-page ads in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook is also very clearly trying to convince regulators (i.e. people that still read paper newspapers) to look at Apple’s privacy changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQtPva"&gt;This is just the latest in an ongoing public spat between Apple and Facebook over iOS 14 privacy and policy changes, and follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;Apple’s new App Store privacy labels&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook also hit out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios"&gt;against Apple’s App Store policies&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, adding to the growing industry pressure against Apple’s cloud gaming restrictions. Facebook also welcomed the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) this week, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/facebook-criticizes-apple-as-it-welcomes-europes-new-tech-rules.html"&gt;hoping that the DMA&lt;/a&gt; “will also set boundaries for Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple defends upcoming privacy changes as ‘standing up for our users’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cjUE4d55cL1LqEvbMWOHVBAAlDA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68526857/FB_ATT_Prompt.001.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the prompt you’ll see when an app asks permission to track your data.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i2gU3K"&gt;Apple has responded to Facebook’s critiques of its upcoming privacy changes by saying that is “standing up for our users,” in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Facebook has been criticizing the company ahead of a future iOS update that will require users to give their permission for apps to collect data about them. Facebook took out full-page newspaper ads today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;attacking Apple&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the changes will “limit businesses’ ability to run personalized ads and reach their customers effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW1vJL"&gt;Here is Apple’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4s8wWG"&gt;We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tshaoY"&gt;Apple’s statement comes as Facebook reportedly plans to run another anti-Apple ad on Friday, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPaczkowski/status/1339375939369615360"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; editor John Paczkowski&lt;/a&gt;. This new ad will reportedly claim that Apple’s software update will “change the internet as we know it for the worse” because places like blogs and cooking sites will have to charge for subscriptions or in-app purchases instead of running personalized ads that would allow them to offer content for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sYx9Lw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Facebook?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Facebook&lt;/a&gt; plans to run a second anti-Apple ad tomorrow. This one will claim &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; is trying to stop the internet from being free. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s some draft text: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Spzx1rwJSc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Spzx1rwJSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Paczkowski (@JohnPaczkowski) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPaczkowski/status/1339375939369615360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GJ5myY"&gt;Apps won’t be required to ask for users’ permission until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;sometime early next year&lt;/a&gt;. The change has already been delayed once — it was originally supposed to kick in with the release of iOS 14 this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flCVEL"&gt;The spat between the two companies comes on the heels of Apple adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;new App Store privacy labels&lt;/a&gt; that spell out how iOS apps use your data. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.3 turns the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max into even better cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZTf4Wwz-AsxzbgiJBpQXh7JPM8=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511660/bfarsace_201106_4269_028.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0yKiG"&gt;If you’ve got an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max and consider yourself something of a photographer, the latest iOS update will help you get the most out of your phone’s cameras. That’s because it includes the new ProRAW feature that Apple first announced back at its October event. ProRAW combines the editing flexibility of RAW with Apple’s computational photography tricks like Smart HDR and Deep Fusion for the first time. You no longer have to choose between the flexibility of a standard RAW file and a JPEG or HEIC file that has all of Apple’s computational magic but limited potential for post-processing because ProRAW gives you both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn29Fn"&gt;Shooting RAW photos on an iPhone is nothing new; for some time now, apps like Halide and Adobe Lightroom have let you capture all of the data the iPhone’s sensor can gather. And all of the usual benefits of RAW are here with ProRAW — vastly improved control over white balance is always the biggest factor for me — but it gives you greater leeway with adjusting exposure, sharpness, dynamic range, and more. You can make better adjustments to facial tone in a portrait or nail the exposure in a landscape shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHU4fB"&gt;But standard RAW images can look very grainy out of the iPhone since, well, these are still small smartphone camera sensors, and they’re without any computational photography optimization. Now, you should notice all the same detail as before but with less noise. That’s because ProRAW images do the same multiframe image processing as ordinary iPhone shots. Even with that, you get around 14 stops of dynamic range to work with in editing software. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnaQ11QShvs"&gt;This video from Josh Stunell on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of illustrating the differences between RAW and ProRAW:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3RPjZ"&gt;ProRAW can be used with all of the rear cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max — it’s not going to suddenly turn the ultrawide into a magic lens, but anything helps — and it also works in night mode. You can even access the people segmentation masks captured by the sensor to make portrait mode-style adjustments after the fact, provided your editing app allows you to control it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXbqRsJXIdQky0lT_oSOdnY1foA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022559/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can shoot ProRAW images with all three of the cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1x51ON"&gt;How to use ProRAW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F4ih6B"&gt;To use ProRAW, first, you’ve got to enable it under the camera options in the settings menu. After that, you’ll see a “RAW” button appear at the upper-right of the camera viewfinder, which is how you can quickly toggle ProRAW on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLtObT"&gt;I should emphasize that while it’s easy to switch this on, you’re definitely not going to want to use ProRAW all the time. Files average around 25MB in size, which is dramatically larger than your everyday iPhone images. This is a feature best reserved for those very intentional photos with people you care about or at places that matter. ProRAW images appear in the camera roll like normal, but if you try to share them in apps like Instagram, you’ll get an error message. So you’ll want to export them as either a smaller JPEG or HEIC file first before sending them to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBt331"&gt;Another nice thing about ProRAW is since it uses Adobe’s widely supported DNG file format, there is already a plethora of apps that can open and edit the files without any update. But apps that use Apple’s own RAW converter will offer even more control since they’ll be able to access tone and distance mapping. Halide has already released an update to get the most out of ProRAW, and I’d expect others like Pixelmator, Darkroom, and Affinity Photo to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NP2Oib"&gt;Apps that have their own RAW converter, namely Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and Capture One, can edit the DNG files today but won’t have all of the same capabilities as those that use Apple’s RAW converter. It’s possible Adobe and others will update their conversion tools in the future to make them work better with ProRAW. You can, of course, also just edit the images inside the Apple Photos app, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_l3ZTohF359m1aD2dhoBqv9yx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169707/IMG_0912_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sample ProRAW image edited in Darkroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBvhVB"&gt;If you want to share a ProRAW image, there are various ways to go about it depending on what you’re trying to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wDL3C4"&gt;If you want to transfer an Apple ProRAW to the computer: ensure the photo is unedited, then either AirDrop or plug the device into USB and use Image Capture or the Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sQEb3m"&gt;If you want to share an edited ProRAW photo:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;edit the photo in the Photos app, then AirDrop, email, or send via Messages. A JPG with the edits will be shared. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VP6iXO"&gt;If you want to email a ProRAW DNG to someone: open the Photos app first and use the share button to share via Mail. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ayEVZd"&gt;If you edit a ProRAW and want both the original DNG file and the edited JPG: use Image Capture or Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZbkyu"&gt;If a ProRAW is edited but you want to transfer a DNG: duplicate the photo, then revert the edits (makes it an unedited file). A DNG can then be AirDropped, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ic83mC"&gt;If you used a third-party app that can take RAW+JPG, and you want both: use Image Capture to grab each file individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="U7m9E1"&gt;I’ve been trying out ProRAW on my iPhone 12 Pro Max over the last few days, and I’m already appreciating the difference it can make. It’s just plain easier to get the most from a photo — retrieve highlights, boost shadows, fix the white balance, etc. — if you’re willing to put in the work of editing after the fact.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3luVi7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article stated that ProRAW provides depth information for editing after the fact. This is incorrect, ProRAW provides segmentation masks for people detected in the frame, which can allow you to create portrait-style images after a photo is captured.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stadia comes to the iPhone and iPad with new iOS beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-l-2xRQOLmTeGnH84RGqTR1vqnI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522982/akrales_191113_3779_0319.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IHlTLd"&gt;Google Stadia has finally made its way to iOS over a year after launch. The company’s mobile web beta for the iPhone and iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;first announced last month&lt;/a&gt;, is launching today. That means any Stadia user on either its free tier or its paid Stadia Pro subscription will be able to access their library of Stadia games on Apple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsmvd1"&gt;Google, like other competing cloud services, is using mobile Safari due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming apps&lt;/a&gt; that mean platforms like Stadia can’t exist in their current form on the App Store. You can access Stadia through its website on Safari or by creating a home screen icon that will turn the service into a progressive web app, so it acts almost identically to a native one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qcI7H"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now&lt;/a&gt; or the planned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;mobile web version of Microsoft’s xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, however, Google Stadia has a free tier without restrictions and now offers two free-to-play games available (&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R&lt;/em&gt;), with more to come. (Nvidia also offers a free tier for GeForce Now, but it has a one-hour session limit.) That means anyone with a Gmail account looking to try Stadia can give it a shot on an iPhone or iPad with minimal effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J29xgg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google Stadia now works on both Android and iOS, thanks to its new mobile web app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jCnxaH"&gt;That accessibility could be key for Stadia’s growth going forward. Much of the early struggles of Stadia, and the many failed or otherwise unknown cloud platforms that have come before it, have to do with a mix of technical issues and economic hurdles, roadblocks that mean actually using the service as your primary gaming platform is more cumbersome and costly than the benefits. But Stadia is in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;much different place now than it was at launch&lt;/a&gt;. The service not only has a free tier and free-to-play games, but it also has access to high-profile holiday releases like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla &lt;/em&gt;and the just-released &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4UQFQ"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s new open-world sci-fi game has been plagued by bugs and performance issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;mainly affecting players on last-gen game consoles&lt;/a&gt;, which is a boon for the Stadia version. Google had to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/13/stadia-cyberpunk-premiere-edition-ended/"&gt;shut down a promotion for the game&lt;/a&gt; that awarded free Stadia controllers and Chromecast Ultra devices to anyone who preordered or purchased &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on Stadia up to a week after its release due to overwhelming demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oTHDB"&gt;Adding iOS support may add to the momentum Stadia is experiencing right now. I’ve had access to the beta on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Stadia test account for the last week or so where I’ve been testing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and other games on my iPad Pro and iPhone 11 Pro. It works remarkably well, even with the built-in touch controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6rRdN"&gt;I wouldn’t recommend relying on those touch controls for anything that requires precise input, but it was nice to know I could still maneuver the &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; interface using my iPhone touchscreen to perform simple tasks, like carousing the in-game Tower hub to pick up bounties or check my character’s inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIQB4B"&gt;Instead of touch, you’re better off using either a Stadia controller or one of the supported Bluetooth gamepads like Microsoft’s Xbox One controller or the Sony DualShock 4, and those controllers work seamlessly via mobile Safari with no issues I’ve encountered so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4KV7KW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ promotion ended early due to overwhelming demand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahaUq"&gt;I will say that you have to rely on a Wi-Fi connection to reliable play on iOS unless you happen to be the owner of a rather rare and situational Ethernet to Lightning or USB adapter accessory. That means you’re not going to get super smooth visuals or performance all of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3JZf7"&gt;Still, a lot of the visual hiccups you might experience from using Stadia on an average Wi-Fi connection on a larger screen are not as noticeable when playing on the iPhone or iPad. In particular, I’ve found playing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on my iPad Pro to be a pretty consistent and solid experience, more so in some cases than on my PlayStation 5 where I find the game often crashes numerous times during a single play session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhm6ka"&gt;Due to Apple’s restrictions, Google says you will need to perform a tiny workaround to get the Stadia web version on your iOS device’s home screen as a progressive web app, and it’s created this graphic to explain it:  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWtie2jMLEozrXhvuepl2VwNu2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174622/Stadia_iOS_setup.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EYTrB3"&gt;The big caveat right now is that there are not a whole lot of great games on Stadia that cater to mobile players. I don’t see anyone going out of their way to boot up the new &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on an iPhone screen, except to marvel at the novelty of it. I think the iPad is primarily where Stadia on iOS will shine for the players who have a nice enough screen, a fast enough connection, and a controller to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03WshK"&gt;But iOS support opens up a lot of avenues for Stadia — not just to bring it more players looking for a more robust mobile gaming solution but also to promote cloud gaming to developers making the kinds of games fit for mobile screens. If Google cozies up to more indie developers and starts supporting more of the less graphical-intensive experiences you might see on, say, a Nintendo Switch, that could make Stadia a much more competitive platform. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Chromecast is getting an Apple TV app soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3czhhyJW1Bp6nd5tJHlB-DYrUHg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522750/DSCF2108.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IeEpFU"&gt;Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;latest Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt; is filling in one of its biggest missing apps, with the company announcing that it’ll &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/apple-tv/"&gt;soon be offering an Apple TV app&lt;/a&gt; in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaG0na"&gt;The Apple TV app will function similarly to other versions of Apple’s service on other devices, allowing subscribers to watch Apple TV Plus original shows, movies, and documentaries (including &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;and other shows that are not &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which are therefore less good). Those Apple TV originals will be integrated into Google TV’s content aggregation system, too, allowing the software to recommend them based on your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHUFpW"&gt;Additionally, the Apple TV app will give Chromecast users access to their purchased iTunes library of TV shows and movies, as well as any Apple TV channels to which they’re already subscribed. The news marks the second major addition of Apple services to Google products, following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22157873/google-apple-music-assistant-nest-smart-speakers-displays"&gt;recently added support&lt;/a&gt; for Apple Music on Google Assistant smart speakers earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lipcwC"&gt;Google hasn’t given an exact release date for the Apple TV app, but it promises that the app should launch in early 2021 — first on the Chromecast with Google TV, then followed by other Android TV OS-powered devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save up to $50 on Apple’s new Mac mini with M1 at B&amp;H Photo today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJz18PtYp96dYMfepUXYW-UwDGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522344/cwelch_201114_4292_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZ8W3Z"&gt;Apple had a solid year of tech products across a wide variety of categories. From introducing the M1 chip on computers (including the MacBook Pro), releasing four new iPhones (including the first iPhone with the “mini” moniker), two new Apple Watches, and a few updates on some iPad models, this year’s releases spanned a wide gamut. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods Max review: luxurious sound for a luxury price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s over-ear headphones have tremendous build quality and sound, but there’s no denying they’re expensive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1P4ReR"&gt;After a long lead-up of rumors, Apple managed to squeeze in the AirPods Max just under the wire as its last big hardware release of 2020. It wasn’t surprising to see the company launch its own over-ear, noise-canceling headphones after the meteoric rise and popularity of AirPods, which have come to define the category of true wireless earbuds; nobody really managed to crack it before Apple. The AirPods Max are entering a very different space, where many other companies have excellent options available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uH1aHX"&gt;There have been a lot of initial reactions to the AirPods Max, but the one that’s dominated them all is sticker shock: the $549 price is hundreds more than what established competitors like Bose and Sony are charging for their quite excellent noise-canceling headphones. And that’s the crux of the challenge Apple faces: unlike with AirPods, it’s late to this game, and there’s a lot to prove if consumers are going to be sold on spending so much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uWfHLG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10230050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1vL4m3"&gt;The price tag of the AirPods Max sits far above mainstream noise-canceling headphones, but there are many headphones that go for the same amount and beyond — wireless ones, too. I don’t think it makes sense to compare these against thousand-dollar (and wired) open-back headphones you’d plug into a DAC for listening sessions with a hi-fi music collection; fundamentally, these are Bluetooth headphones aimed at a large consumer audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r34qU7"&gt;Even so, Apple has tried to match that upper echelon of boutique headphones in terms of build quality and craftsmanship: the AirPods Max have a design heavy on aluminum, steel, and fabric that’s the polar opposite of something like Sony’s plastic-everywhere WH-1000XM4 headphones. There’s nothing &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with plastic; those Sony cans have taken a beating in my bag and still work great. But everything about the AirPods Max exudes precision — even their unibody metal ear cups, bland as they might seem. (The widely ridiculed carrying “case” is antithetical to this whole notion, but I’ll get to that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwAWH5"&gt;This isn’t a review where I’m going to say that the AirPods Max are the best headphones for most people. They are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. If all you want is a good, reliable set of noise-canceling headphones for commuting, travel, or working from home, save your money and stick with something like the Sony 1000XM4s, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, or the Microsoft Surface Headphones 2, all of which cost at least $200 less. You’ll be well served by any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWi6F_7pX1BvXr2Cs7-tQQUnOJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173981/DSCF2705_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JWPBfk"&gt;That said, the AirPods Max &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; make sense for certain people who can immediately find a reason they’re “worth it.” The comfort and feel are top notch, they sound wonderful, the noise cancellation is up there with the very best, and they offer unique features like spatial audio that you really can’t get elsewhere. At least, not quite like this. So it’s worth breaking down some reasons why the AirPods Max could be worth buying if you’ve got the disposable cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR83bg"&gt;Fit and finish top the list of pros. The AirPods Max have a stainless steel headband that’s wrapped in a soft polyurethane material. A knit mesh canopy does a good job of keeping the substantial weight of these headphones from putting irritating pressure on the top of your head. The rotating, pivoting aluminum ear cups are attached by telescoping steel stems that take some effort to extend but always stay in place at whatever length you leave them. (The headphones can’t fold up for more efficient storage, unfortunately.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ri-m_ZrRCZfn0dGhgLIZUzR-t9U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173665/DSCF2665.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s craftsmanship is on full display with the AirPods Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Silr6"&gt;The ear cushions are made from acoustic memory foam with a breathable mesh layer on top. Hopefully, that’ll make for less sweaty ears in warmer months. They attach magnetically, are easy to take off, and popping them back into place is immensely satisfying. The ear cushions are large and oval-shaped, so they won’t uncomfortably press against your ears like some circular ear pads can. Replacement sets (and other colors) are available for $69 a pair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMyQZN"&gt;I’d recommend steering clear of the silver or other lighter colors; the white ear cushions on my review unit are already starting to look a bit dirty after just a few days of wearing them. Going for space gray or the blue color would be my recommendation. The trade-off of Apple’s high-style design is that these materials won’t stay pristine; the company &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208729"&gt;provides basic cleaning instructions&lt;/a&gt;, and the ear cushions are easy enough to pop off and wipe down, but I’m not sure what you’re supposed to do if, say, the headband fabric gets mucked up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPKgoo8smrsie4vx_q7jiXawtV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173682/DSCF2676.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cushions are super comfortable and should accommodate ears of any size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s6qmek"&gt;Look around the AirPods Max and you’ll find just two buttons: there’s the Digital Crown — a much larger version than the dial on the Apple Watch — and a button that switches between noise canceling and transparency modes. I’ve really come to like the crown for controlling volume and playback; you don’t get the false inputs or missed swipes that can happen with touch gestures. It’s also easier to use with gloves in cold weather. You press it once to play / pause, twice to skip tracks, or three times to go back; holding it down will activate Siri. Sometimes my fingers will hit the steel stem when feeling for it since they’re close together, but that’s a minor gripe that muscle memory should overcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8liBs"&gt;You’ll notice I said nothing about a power button, and that’s because the AirPods Max lack one. They power on when placed on your head, and automatically pause music if removed (or if you lift one ear cup). Take them off fully, and they’ll go into a sleep mode when left on a table or around your neck for a few minutes. When slid into their case, the headphones enter a deeper ultra-low-power mode. I’ve left the AirPods Max out overnight several times without the case and they’ve barely lost any of their charge, so you don’t need to worry about battery drain. This design quirk has been deemed “very Apple” by some, but I wish they’d just stuck a power button somewhere for simplicity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBpsVm"&gt;There are a lot of cutouts for microphones and sensors around the AirPods Max — there are nine microphones in all, with eight of them used for noise cancellation — and behind those ear cushions are powerful, custom-designed 40-millimeter drivers. Apple says the “dual-neodymium ring magnet motor” backing each driver is inspired by floor-standing speakers and is the reason you won’t hear any distortion even when the Max headphones are cranked to peak volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YuNGcz8IBVQajdFqVk6GHwUE70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173866/DSCF2681_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max feature 40mm drivers designed by Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hoZsPT"&gt;On that note, the second pro for the AirPods Max is sound quality. These headphones make for delightful listening. Apple has struck a great balance between the highs, mids, and lows, and there’s a broader soundstage with these than you’d get from the Sony or the Bose cans. The bass isn’t going to rattle your skull, but in my tests, I’ve consistently found there’s always enough to make songs shine as they’re supposed to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6gi0u"&gt;Apple uses “computational audio” with the H1 chips in each ear cup and the aforementioned mics to constantly measure what you’re hearing from the headphones, and it adjusts EQ to account for how the headphones fit your head and seal against your ears. The company says it aims for a faithful reproduction of your music, but don’t mistake these for flat or neutral studio headphones. If I had to pick two words to describe them, I’d say tight and refined. You get ample bass, and higher frequencies never sound harsh or fatiguing. Complex, multi-layered arrangements from Bon Iver or Phoebe Bridgers are immersive and uncluttered. Acoustic guitars come through with satisfying warmth and clarity. The low end is never muddy — regardless of genre — and the AirPods Max do a great job of showcasing every element of a well-produced track. With these headphones, you get the best of everything Apple has learned about audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RLGDV"&gt;But a lot of people want to know whether the AirPods Max sound &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt; to justify their high price. And there’s no easy answer. If you’re nitpicky about audio quality, you’ll notice how great these sound. But the Sony 1000XM4s are popular for a reason, and one of them is booming bass, a criteria where they can still handily beat out the AirPods Max. Other noise-canceling headphones like the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless also give Apple a run for its money on sound quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VMYlJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10230439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3qHDGB"&gt;When it comes to active noise cancellation, Apple is neck and neck with the very best. The AirPods Max do an equally good job as Sony and Bose at quieting the outside world. They might even be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s all very close. They aced my tests at the coffee shop, on the subway, and walking through Manhattan. When you do need to hear what’s happening, transparency mode sounds just as natural here — almost like you’re not wearing headphones at all — as with the AirPods Pro. Apple leads the pack on this feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG6JDi"&gt;Another reason to consider the AirPods Max is spatial audio. Like the AirPods Pro, these can give you an immersive experience that mimics surround sound on an iPhone or iPad when you’re watching videos with supported apps like Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, and HBO Max. (Audio from shows and movies with a 5.1 or 7.1 mix can be converted into spatial audio.) We’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18093348/dolby-dimension-headphone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Dolby&lt;/a&gt; and other companies pursue immersive surround sound headphones before, but Apple’s approach feels a bit more visceral and captivating and should only get better with time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUTgXf"&gt;Since iPhones and iPads have positional awareness from their built-in sensors, they can send that data to the headphones to keep the sound in front of you at all times; even if you turn your head side to side, the sound field stays planted wherever the device is. Spatial audio doesn’t quite stack up to an actual 7.1 Atmos system. How could it? But it’s a captivating experience that will come in handy once everyone starts traveling again. You’ll absolutely notice the downgrade if you switch back to regular stereo audio for a superhero flick. I really wish spatial audio worked with the Apple TV, so you could experience great sound in the living room — and from a big screen — even if you don’t have a soundbar or surround setup. This would also let you get absorbed in an action blockbuster with a partner sleeping beside you at night. But for now, the Apple TV can’t do spatial audio since it lacks the positional sensors in Apple’s mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOQQZE"&gt;The last big win for the AirPods Max is that they’re just… &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. Like regular AirPods, they pair to your phone simply by holding the two close together. And with the latest iOS and macOS software updates, they can now automatically switch between an iPhone, iPad, and Mac depending on what device you’re using at that moment — without you having to do anything. If I’m paying $550 for headphones, I damn sure want that level of convenience. That said, the Sony, Bose, and many other headphones let you pair with two devices at the same time, so that might be enough flexibility for you, especially if not every device you use has an Apple logo on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlwA5jb2W7XX8QvLNIoZ_s3hTXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173667/DSCF2672.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This AirPods Max “case” offers little in the way of everyday protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CYVwwk"&gt;But now we come to the cons, and far and away the worst thing about the AirPods Max is their case. If you can call it that, which I consider generous. Look, putting aside all the memes about it looking like a handbag or bra, it’s a failure on every level at functionality, and I don’t know what Apple was thinking. It makes the AirPods Max easy to recognize at a distance — maybe that was the main goal — but in terms of doing &lt;strong&gt;case&lt;/strong&gt; things, it’s a joke that offers virtually no protection for your $550 headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtHwPE"&gt;I wouldn’t feel good about throwing this into a packed bag; the ear cups could get scratched since there are so many slits in the case, and something could poke through that exposed mesh canopy. The case also picks up dirt and smudges in no time. This is a bad enough misfire that it drags down the entire product. Everyone else gets this right, and it’s baffling that Apple could get it so wrong. I’d expect to see many third-party cases for the AirPods Max very soon, and I predict Apple will sell some of those directly — because this thing is just untenable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-9dGrfhl27Chu-2MvPE2piYSpk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173805/DSCF2666_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max lack a 3.5mm jack and only have a Lightning port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q4OVWW"&gt;Another downside? No 3.5mm jack. The AirPods Max only have a Lightning connector, so if you want higher-quality wired audio or to plug them in on a plane, you’ve got to get a $35 cable. (No, putting an aux cord between two iPhone headphone dongles won’t work.) Ouch. I can live without the 3.5mm jack, but to not include the cable in the box? At this price?! Rude. Also, it’s worth mentioning that there’s no passive mode for the AirPods Max. When they’re out of juice, they stop working altogether — even if you’re wired. You can’t use the very good, clear-sounding voice mics on the headphones when plugged in, either. But the cable is good for eliminating all latency if you want to use the AirPods Max for recording or monitoring purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nBfHF"&gt;Battery life is rated at 20 hours with all the features like noise cancellation turned on, which is good and more than adequate for lengthy flights, but still 10 or so hours less than Sony’s total running time. On a drained battery, charging for five minutes will get you around 90 minutes of playing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFKIvA"&gt;Now let me double back to just how much the AirPods Max weigh. The open mesh canopy does a good job of distributing their heft (even on my enormous head), and the ear cushions reduce any feeling of being weighed down. But at 385 grams, there’s no denying these are a good deal heavier than cans from Bose or Sony (254 grams). They’re not uncomfortable for me — even after a couple hours of nonstop listening — but I’m always very aware that they’re on. And it’s something to be mindful of if you’ve had any neck problems. These are definitely leisure headphones meant for the couch or sitting at your desk — and, eventually, they’ll be great travel headphones — but gym or running headphones they are not. The AirPods Max aren’t water resistant at all, but that’s true of most premium noise-canceling headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAkWfP"&gt;The last reason to hold off on the AirPods Max right now is what I consider unrealized potential. Most people are going to be streaming Apple Music or Spotify through these things. And that means (in the case of Apple Music) you’re limited to the same compressed 256kbps AAC files we’ve been listening to for years. Apple still doesn’t offer a lossless tier, and I have to ask, if not now, when? I can plug into my iPhone with the cable and get higher quality music from Amazon Music HD or Tidal than I can from Apple itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxgXqw"&gt;On the Android side, Sony’s headphones have LDAC, a wireless codec that can wirelessly stream music at near-CD quality. Apple is falling behind here, but there’s no indication that the company cares. You can make all the arguments you want about how it doesn’t matter or that people can’t hear any difference, but when we’re talking about $550 headphones — not to mention the powerful HomePod speaker — an option to enjoy higher-quality audio should at least be there. Apple moved to 256kbps AAC &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2007%2F05%2F30Apple-Launches-iTunes-Plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22177494%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all the way back in 2007&lt;/a&gt; and we’ve been stuck there ever since. (“Mastered for iTunes” albums can offer improved dynamic range and subtle enhancements, but it’s no replacement for going lossless.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jg5OSk"&gt;Shipping estimates for the AirPods Max are already extending into March, but I hesitate to read too much into that. These headphones might end up a hit like the earbuds they share a name with, but they could also just coast by in the same vein as something like the HomePod, another Apple product that was priced higher than the competition when released (and hurt by it). If you’re the kind of person that knows you’ll love the AirPods Max, you shouldn’t hesitate to go for it. They sound killer for music and movies alike. And they &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they should cost even more money. They’re about as luxurious as noise-canceling headphones get — but not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409031/bang-olufsen-beoplay-h95-noise-canceling-headphones-announced"&gt;as expensive as they come&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cv2URg"&gt;But there’s still no world where I recommend the AirPods Max to your average headphone shopper, especially when the AirPods Pro offer a lot of the same features for less. Many consumers will be perfectly happy sticking with the tried-and-true options from Sony, Bose, Microsoft, and elsewhere. At the very least, it’s probably worth waiting for Apple Music HD or spatial audio on the Apple TV or, for god’s sake, a better case.&lt;/p&gt;
