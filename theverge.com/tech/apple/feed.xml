    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2DXjp"&gt;The refreshed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; hit shelves in April, but the anticipated tvOS 15 update that introduces exciting updates to the Apple TV experience was previously only available in beta. That will change next week: Apple has confirmed tvOS 15 will become widely available to everyone on September 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkRNFp"&gt;Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the tvOS 15 update will go live the same day as its other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;operating system updates&lt;/a&gt;, which include iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The tvOS 15 update brings a number of new features to the Apple TV experience. SharePlay is arguably the most exciting addition to the experience and will allow FaceTime users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;stream titles together&lt;/a&gt; in sync across their Apple devices, including on Apple TV. However, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;confirmed in August&lt;/a&gt; that the feature would be delayed on iOS 15 and tvOS 15 initially and would arrive in a later update, so that feature’s currently still on ice — for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xszn4z"&gt;tvOS will also add two new discovery features to its Apple TV app: For All of You and Shared with You. For All of You will appear as a new row in the Apple TV app and will suggest titles for an entire household to stream together. Shared with You, meanwhile, will show movies and series that have been shared from Messages in their own row within the Apple TV app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rMl7tB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New discovery features and eventual support for SharePlay will arrive with tvOS 15&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1FPUPb"&gt;Plus, tvOS is also getting a handful of less flashy but nonetheless functionally exciting updates. Beginning with tvOS 15, Apple TV users will see an on-screen prompt to connect their AirPods for easy silent streaming, and the AirPods Pro or AirPods Max will also get support for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt; when connected to the Apple TV for a theater-like experience. The update will also introduce HomePod Mini pairing as well as a HomeKit update that will allow Apple TV users to see multiple home camera feeds at once. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about whether any of these other expected features would be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXl0z9"&gt;tvOS 15 will be supported on the Apple TV HD, Apple TV 4K (2017), and the latest Apple TV 4K (2021). Look for the software update in the settings menu on your Apple TV device beginning next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP3dqaskJRC84C50bnOQSSkyrOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525171/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyU16X"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;are launching officially on September 20th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but you can test them in the public beta right now if you’re willing to risk encountering possible bugs. Here, we walk you through the steps for installing the software. It’s a similar process for the iPhone and iPad, but we’ve made separate sections for each OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TncjxD"&gt;As expected, Apple announced the release date at its September event, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;it also showed off the new iPhone 13, iPad Mini with USB-C charging, and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFiozr"&gt;Before we get started, here’s the usual word of warning about installing unfinished beta software: these releases may seem stable for general use, but they could contain some bugs. Your experience may differ from others depending on the apps you use. And finally, if you do decide to install, I suggest backing up your device’s data, in case things go badly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdqQYd6S1VclYKqBImQmlJQ5trA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643660/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GE7efX"&gt;What are the new features that come with iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ajIb8j"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;new features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; include updates to FaceTime, Messages, notifications, privacy controls, and much more. For example, FaceTime will support spatial audio and reflect the speaker’s location on-screen, with a new voice isolation ability that can remove background noise. Other changes for FaceTime include the ability to share music and videos during calls and to invite Android users to a FaceTime call with a shareable link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhlCIp"&gt;SharePlay, which will allow people to enjoy streaming entertainment together at the same time, was one of iOS 15’s most anticipated features, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;Apple recently decided that it won’t arrive&lt;/a&gt; in the final version of iOS 15 launching on September 20th. Instead, it’ll arrive later in fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RjIx6e"&gt;What devices are supported for iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C29a2b"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4rqkT"&gt;iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4MYuU8"&gt;iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWbtK7"&gt;iPhone X, iPhone XR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gPzYC"&gt;iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xXbea7"&gt;iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CrMC2z"&gt;iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WTQtvI"&gt;iPhone SE (first and second generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jl56Ou"&gt;iPod Touch (seventh generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A0LR1r"&gt;How to install the iOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwP76L"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your phone’s Safari browser and agree to sign in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TSasnT"&gt;Select “Enroll Your Devices” within the drop-down menu at the top right of the webpage, if it automatically doesn’t route you there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pUOjHU"&gt;Select “iOS,” which is the left-most option on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to make sure that you’ve sent a backup of your phone’s content to your macOS computer, in case you need to revert to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxm87C"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then tap on it. This will bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You will get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d1bnSQ"&gt;Open the Settings app. A new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you’ll have access to the beta software download. You may need to restart your phone for the profile to activate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yJf4ys"&gt;Congrats, you did it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67NLyjVyqi1TZegsQ794RWjvKic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643196/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.49.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WEwIsU"&gt;What are the new features that come with iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Ft4C"&gt;This year’s version of iPadOS makes the home screen more customizable, and it makes split-screen multitasking easier. The App Library feature introduced last year in iOS 14 has made its way to this new iPad software. Additionally, many of the features that Apple is bringing to iOS 15 are also coming to the tablet lineup, including more spatial audio for FaceTime, portrait mode, and SharePlay, which lets you watch TV or listen to music with others who are on the call. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;Chris Welch wrote all about the new features here&lt;/a&gt;, including a section on how iPadOS 15 “punts for another year on ‘pro’ requests,” delivering features that will appeal more generally to people instead of ones for pro-level users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pS9XwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says you can build apps on an iPad now, but devs say the reality is trickier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534902/ipad-pro-apple-swift-playgrounds-4-wwdc-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kMvcyI"&gt;What devices are supported for iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2amtEx"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gYFnXh"&gt;iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first through fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7awfUC"&gt;iPad Pro 11-inch (first through third generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nSheDn"&gt;iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q39aHn"&gt;iPad Pro 9.7-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LooIpb"&gt;iPad (fifth through eighth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0fRC4p"&gt;iPad Mini (fourth and fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gb9MY"&gt;iPad Air (second through fourth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OEDSbC"&gt;How to download the iPadOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vRB6nl"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your iPad’s Safari browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VyVf4p"&gt;Click “Enroll Your Devices” at the top of the webpage (you may need to scroll horizontally to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JizQFZ"&gt;Click “iPadOS,” which is the option that’s second from the left on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to first make a backup on your macOS computer in case you need to revert your OS to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7E9jLb"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then select it. This may bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You’ll get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vgHgoU"&gt;Open the Settings app, and a new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you should have access to the beta software download. You might need to restart your iPad first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aMnO1y"&gt;Lastly, if nothing prompts you to get started with the download, open the Settings app, head to General, then find “Software Update” to install the beta software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 is a pitch-perfect iPhone 12S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUFXBjqnWjabkSZro3YqcNX8z84=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69862804/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13, featuring a very similar design to the iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JI022T"&gt;Apple had a lot of new features to announce with its iPhone 13 lineup this week. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; have better battery life, faster A15 Bionic processors, smaller display notches, upgraded cameras, and, when it comes to the Pro models, high refresh rate 120Hz ProMotion displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwsNDn"&gt;It’s a nice collection of updates, but take a step back and the range starts to look an awful lot like an iterative update over last year’s iPhone 12. They have an almost identical look to the squared-off design introduced with last year’s models, and Apple was careful to not directly compare the performance of its new A15 Bionic chip to last year’s A14 Bionic, only to its competitors. There’s also no major new initiative like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;MagSafe ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; that Apple kicked off last year, and on the bottom of the phones you’ll see the same old Lightning port rather than USB-C. It all feels very familiar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lcv5Zw"&gt;So it’s no wonder that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheTechChap/status/1437847213594587136"&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AbhyudayaMohan/status/1437843526323040261"&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1437837861454106626"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; immediately responded to the phones’ announcement by referring to them as the “iPhone 12S,” aka a minor update to last year’s iPhone 12. That’s how Apple used to name its phones. There’d be a major update one year, usually with a big design change, followed up with a more minor revision that changed some internal components and features but kept the overall look and feel the same. The iPhone 3GS, 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS all used this approach. So what changed?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 5S 1024" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SL25tWylCs3ChepHV76_qzTKiCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13062703/IMG_3022-1024.1419979922.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Michael Shane / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 5S, which added a fingerprint sensor to Apple’s smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GGPTl4"&gt;Apple started to move away from this formula with 2016’s iPhone 7. Not only did the iPhone 7 break the cycle by using a very similar design to the previous year’s 6S instead of a new look (aside, of course, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12823596/apple-iphone-7-no-headphone-jack-lightning-earbuds"&gt;infamous missing headphone jack&lt;/a&gt;), but it was never followed by an S-model of its own. Instead, the next year Apple jumped straight to the iPhone 8, a minor revision that absolutely deserved to be called the 7S, and which ended up being completely overshadowed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review"&gt;that year’s iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsSCKp"&gt;Ever since 2018’s iPhone XS, it seems like Apple has abandoned the S-suffix entirely. Every year gets a new number, regardless of whether it offers a major overhaul like the iPhone 12 or a more minor update like the iPhone 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNdWnB"&gt;Of course, Apple’s closest competitor in the US, Samsung, has been using this approach for years. Every subsequent Galaxy S device has had a bigger number than its predecessor, and nobody wants to be the company with the lower-numbered phone than its rival. In fact, if Apple &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;released an iPhone 7S in 2017 it would have competed against Samsung’s Galaxy S8. No wonder Apple jumped straight to 8 and skipped the iPhone 9 entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqP5Nz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s wild in retrospect that Apple willingly advertised its “off” years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WKhPf"&gt;In retrospect it seems absolutely wild that Apple was willing to proudly broadcast that it was having an off year. Unless you were the kind of smartphone user that wanted to have the most up-to-date iPhone year after year, that S-suffix was a helpful indication that a new model only contained minor changes. “Don’t worry about upgrading this year, folks,” was the implicit message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXO6qh"&gt;But the reality was that smartphone technology was advancing so quickly at the time that even a “minor” upgrade could still contain massive new features. The iPhone 3GS was the first iPhone that could officially record video in addition to taking photos, the iPhone 4S introduced Apple’s Siri voice assistant to the world, and the 5S was the first iPhone with biometric security (a fingerprint sensor). These are all major additions that we now take for granted on modern Apple devices, and they arrived with the relatively muted fanfare of an S-branded iPhone. The S-branded iPhones also offered big camera improvements over the years: the 4S was the first with an 8-megapixel camera, the 5S added slow-motion video, and the 6S increased the rear camera’s resolution to 12 megapixels. Every year, Apple gave its customers a pretty good reason to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iphone 6s" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08MMY8EtNQN_-E4JW2hG6tBI1xU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4084770/iphone-6s-clean-2-15__1_.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6S, the first iPhone with a 12-megapixel camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="irYQi1"&gt;The smartphone market is now a very different place. Smartphones have matured, and even midrange models offer basically everything most people actually need a phone to do. Every year we’re told about the latest phones’ performance upgrades and edge-case camera improvements, but it’s nothing that’s going to completely change your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Uvi33"&gt;Consumers have noticed. Far from upgrading to the latest iPhone every year, as of 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/smartphone-users-are-waiting-longer-before-upgrading-heres-why.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt; that US customers were waiting an average of over two years to upgrade their phones, while in the UK people were waiting almost 28 months. At the time, these figures were all trending upward, and it seems safe to assume that they’ve grown even longer in the two years since. It was also around this time that iPhone sales &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166399/iphone-android-apple-samsung-smartphone-sales-peak"&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940562/apple-q4-2019-earnings-iphone-sales-record-revenue-slow-services-income-mac-ipad-tim-cook"&gt;plateau&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18053782/apple-earnings-q4-2018-stop-ipad-iphone-mac-unit-sales-disclosure"&gt;Apple stopped reporting on iPhone sales numbers&lt;/a&gt;, opting instead to bundle their numbers in with other device categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vil21C"&gt;Instead of focusing on big upgrades, Apple seems to be prioritizing a bigger lineup with devices to appeal to different tastes and price points. As recently as 2017, the company was selling just two flagship phones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The following year it released three (the 8, 8 Plus, and X), and last year it switched to four with the iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max. With so many form factors to keep updated, it’s not surprising that big overhauls have become less common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nhsk6R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;People upgrade much less frequently than they once did&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCYiaF"&gt;Unless you really want the latest and greatest technology, there really isn’t much of a reason to upgrade every year, and that’s a good thing! It’s much more affordable for those people who opt to buy their phones outright, and it’s worlds better for the environment. Apple may now be using more recycled materials in its devices, but manufacturing them and shipping them in the first place still uses resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBFxeT"&gt;In this context, it isn’t surprising that Apple has changed with the times. For starters, it’s making more of an effort to make money outside of hardware, like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;increasingly broad array of subscription services&lt;/a&gt; covering everything from music and video streaming, to gaming and home fitness. If it can’t make money from selling you a new iPhone every year, it’ll sure as hell try to make money from you streaming the latest season of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hty5L5"&gt;That doesn’t mean that Apple has given up on the idea of selling you a new phone every year. Far from it. If branding this year’s phones as the iPhone 13 tells us anything, it’s that Apple is more keen than ever to convince its customers to upgrade, by branding this year’s phones as an all-new range as opposed to a more modest update to the iPhone 12. The slowing progress of smartphone technology means that Apple can’t afford to rest on its laurels with an S-branded device. Everything needs to be brand-new and as exciting as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYnqtS"&gt;So yes, this year’s iPhones could, and arguably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been branded as the iPhone 12S. But the smartphone industry has changed, and Apple has changed with it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to back up your iPhone with or without iCloud</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DHLC2SDBvxwcZNqwYAAjGTOV0_w=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69861463/vpavic_4279_20201107_0166.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8J0AP"&gt;Yes, of course you want to back up your iPhone — as we all know, despite phone cases and Gorilla glass and careful engineering, disaster — in the form of cracked displays, lost devices, and three-year-olds who think it’s fun to sit on your latest phone — can happen. When that happens, you want to have all your data backed up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gdx7nE"&gt;The easiest way to go is to back up using iCloud, which is not only simple to set up, but makes it just as simple to set up a new phone if your old one is no longer available. (You can also back up to other services, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7070690?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;amp;oco=1"&gt;such as Google Drive&lt;/a&gt;, but it isn’t nearly as convenient.) Or, if you’re an iPhone user who is steadfast about retaining your privacy, you can back up your iPhone to your Mac or Windows computer and retain full control of your data backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkrsTe"&gt;Here’s how to back up to iCloud or your laptop / desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A5xQq7"&gt;Back up to iCloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ntzmom"&gt;Tap on “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “iCloud” &amp;gt; “iCloud Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEEtWS"&gt;If “iCloud Backup” is switched off, toggle it on. If it’s already toggled on, and you’re preparing to wipe your old iPhone, you may want to tap “Back Up Now” just in case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="42Vj94"&gt;Back up to your desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="q4yNJb"&gt;Connect your phone to your computer using its charging cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u98X3q"&gt;Fire up iTunes if you’re using Windows or a Mac with macOS 10.14 or earlier; use Finder on a Mac with macOS 10.15 Catalina or later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3WFTtc"&gt;If you’re using Finder, open a Finder window (by either clicking on the Finder icon in your dock or selecting “File” &amp;gt; “New Finder Window” in the top Finder menu bar), and look for your iPhone in the left-hand menu under “Locations.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Using Finder to change your backup from iCloud to local." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LpyaCLgWzhHg1Cg0vAR6lPXwdcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850810/Back_up_local.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Finder to change your backup from iCloud to local.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="xESSHN"&gt;In iTunes, you should see a small iPhone icon in the upper left corner; select that. (If you don’t see it, you may need to authorize your system. Go to the top iTunes menu and select “Account” &amp;gt; “Authorizations” &amp;gt; “Authorize This Computer...” and follow the instructions.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Look for the phone icon in iTunes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fcX3T0mVGOd03AoSRAhP_2hssk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19621952/capture1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look for the phone icon in iTunes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vbihSr"&gt;After that, the process for either iTunes or Finder is much the same, although the look of the pages and the language will be slightly different. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0HcxIe"&gt;If this is the first time you’ve done this, when you click on the phone icon, you may be asked if you trust the phone, first on the computer and then on the phone itself. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tqi2Ff"&gt;First-timers may also be asked if you want to set your phone up as a new device or restore it from a previous backup. In this case, select the first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ybT9kA"&gt;Select the “General” tab on top and look for the category labeled “Backups.” Select “This computer” (in iTunes) or “Back up all of the data on your iPhone to your Mac” (in Finder).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Using Finder to set up a computer to back up your iPhone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kp08AHvo-OgefDCZ_jy2siRvFIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850821/Back_up_local.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Finder to set up a computer to back up your iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xjJWQH"&gt;You’re going to want to encrypt your backup for increased security. Check “Encrypt iPhone backup” (in iTunes) or “Encrypt local backup” (in Finder) and enter a password. Don’t lose that password; otherwise, you’re going to lose access to your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mtduMI"&gt;Once you set the encryption, it’s probable that the backup will start automatically. Otherwise, click on “Back Up Now.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Using iTunes to change your backup from iCloud to this computer." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J76ttAeeprB_WZmEnsd5gLGU9dk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19621934/iTunes_Windows.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using iTunes to change your backup from iCloud to this computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hk5PlL"&gt;If you need to restore your backup, just go to the same page and click on “Restore Backup...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qz2x43"&gt;Note that you can either manually back up your iPhone, or you can also have it automatically back up each time you connect it to your computer. Look for “Options” just below the “Backups” section, and select “Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="370tiP"&gt;Once you’ve set up your backup to your computer, you may want to delete any backups you’ve made to iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z75WN1"&gt;To do this on your Mac:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Y0Mds6"&gt;Click on the Apple icon in the top corner of your system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2wU71T"&gt;Select “System Preferences” &amp;gt; “Internet Accounts” &amp;gt; “iCloud.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hvB7wJ"&gt;Select the “Manage” button in the lower right corner of the window and then “Backups.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select a backup to delete, then click on the minus icon in the lower left of the window." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5j7evsFvwBbuG9w7LiVf-JpKlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850826/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_3.55.51_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select a backup to delete, then click on the minus icon in the lower left of the window.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="SUpXNX"&gt;Select a backup to delete, click on the minus icon in the lower left of the window, and select “Delete.” This will both delete all your backups from iCloud and turn off any further backups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FospSP"&gt;To do this on your iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bDxoDC"&gt;Go to “Settings” and tap your name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jbDLWm"&gt;Select “iCloud” &amp;gt; “Manage Storage” &amp;gt; “Backups.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tj4rsn"&gt;Tap on “Delete Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M2aeNF"&gt;Tap on “Turn Off &amp;amp; Delete.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “iCloud” &amp;amp;gt; “Manage Storage” &amp;amp;gt; “Backups” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ILLxho3N5d4ocmoWvDekekk0lqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850828/delete_iphone_icloud_backup.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “iCloud” &amp;gt; “Manage Storage” &amp;gt; “Backups” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on “Turn Off &amp;amp;amp; Delete” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ab6HvEBrTkkNFD5cvNlaxbQ8Z00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850830/delete_iphone_icloud_backup2.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to move all your data to your new iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7wBVftLLpYG13H9yLx0WkeJBIU=/0x131:1960x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69861410/Apple_iPhone_13_Pro_Colors_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ynDHQ5"&gt;If you’ve just upgraded — or are planning to upgrade — to Apple’s new iPhone 13, congratulations! You’re going to want to try out your snazzy new phone as soon as you open that box. But first, you need to get all of the apps and data from your old iPhone onto your new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXiQdD"&gt;It’s actually very easy — in fact, if you haven’t upgraded for a while, you’ll find it easier than ever. The process of moving your data used to require restoring it from an iCloud or iTunes backup. Now, you don’t have to bother with that backup (although backing up your stuff is always a good idea). You can move your apps, data, and ID over to the new phone directly with what Apple calls iPhone migration. (However, if you prefer, you can still restore it from iCloud.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig4Hth"&gt;Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qLf7qh"&gt;First, back up your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ffuR80"&gt;No matter how you decide to move your data, it’s a good idea to have a current backup of all of your data saved on iCloud, your laptop, or any other local / cloud storage. Backing up your phone on iCloud Backup is probably the easiest. If it’s been a while and you want to make sure backup is switched on in your phone’s iCloud settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ntzmom"&gt;Tap on “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “iCloud” &amp;gt; “iCloud Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEEtWS"&gt;If “iCloud Backup” is switched off, toggle it on. If it’s already toggled on, and you’re preparing to wipe your old iPhone, you may want to tap “Back Up Now” just in case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nGLcQ1"&gt;You can also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-up-iphone-iph3ecf67d29/ios"&gt;back up your iPhone to a computer&lt;/a&gt;: either to your Mac by using your Finder (if your Mac is using a macOS version before 10.15, you’ll use iTunes) or to a Windows PC (again, using iTunes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol0mKl"&gt;Before you start, there are a couple more things you need to do first: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9XDgnJ"&gt;If your older phone is paired to an Apple Watch, unpair it. (Your data will be moved to the new phone.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q0hmI9"&gt;Transfer your SIM to your new phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TPzkbG"&gt;Okay, now that your backup is done and everything else is ready, let’s move your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QqsLLV"&gt;From a direct wireless connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="aCssOZ"&gt;This phone-to-phone transfer is called Quick Start, for obvious reasons. Start up your new phone. You’ll have the option to enter your Apple ID; otherwise, you’ll be asked a couple of initial questions (such as what language you want to use) and then you’ll be invited to transfer data from another phone, if you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ksjxup"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A wireless phone-to-phone transfer is called Quick Start, for obvious reasons&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g9Prxj"&gt;Put your old phone near your new one. Make sure both phones are plugged in to power (you don’t want them running out of battery in the middle of the data move).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bSrqXK"&gt;When the connection is made, your new iPhone screen will display an animation and your old phone will open its camera and display a blank circle in the middle of the screen. You’ll be asked to hold your new iPhone up to the camera of your old one so that the animation is centered in the circle. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rQ4qle"&gt;You’ll then be invited to move your attention to your new phone to finish the setup. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LFf7eL"&gt;Enter your passcode and Apple ID when asked; you may also be asked whether you want to setup Face ID or Touch ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vJ0xID"&gt;There will be several screens to go through before the transfer begins, including the usual terms and conditions, whether you want to share your location and your analytics, and whether you want to set up FaceTime, iMessage, and Siri. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iv6IC8"&gt;You will also get the choice of moving your data from your previous phone, or from your iCloud backup. If you’ve backed up onto your computer, you can find that under “Other Options.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ayUL14"&gt;Once you’ve made all your choices, the transfer will begin. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y06nu4"&gt;Sign in to your new iPhone again and you’re done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LeCQxF"&gt;From a direct wired connection between phones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TVMcpR"&gt;One advantage of Apple’s updated migration feature is that you can also use a cable to transfer the data. If you’re having any trouble with the wireless transfer, this could be a good alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jmh4Ng"&gt;For a wired connection, you’ll need a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Lightning-USB3-Camera-Adapter/dp/B01F7KJDIM/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lightning to USB 3 camera adapter&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MQUE2AM-A-Lightning-Cable/dp/B07CPS16L4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lightning to USB cable&lt;/a&gt;. And a word of advice: make sure both phones are fully charged before you start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6dWjSJ"&gt;As with the wireless method, start up your new phone and go through the initial questions until you get the invite to transfer data from another phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LS9Rno"&gt;As before, put your old phone near your new one and make sure both phones are plugged in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U5Nai0"&gt;Connect the Lightning to USB 3 camera adapter to your old phone. Connect the Lightning to USB cable to your new phone. Join the two cables together using the adapter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9FlKrN"&gt;After that, follow the same directions as above, including using the camera to find the pattern and answering all the setup questions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hXZQUW"&gt;You’ll know that the phones are using the wired setup because once the transfer starts, there will be a small “cable” between the two phone icons on the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can restore a phone’s data if you’ve backed it up on your computer." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nL6rDNJaKSRRIzixvGIq2d9Eak0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850986/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_3.48.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can restore a phone’s data if you’ve backed it up on your computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LdnbBc"&gt;From a direct wired connection with a Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GzxVtp"&gt;If you’ve backed up your iPhone to a Mac, you can download your data from there to the new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="q4yNJb"&gt;Connect your phone to your computer using its charging cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u98X3q"&gt;Fire up Finder, and select your phone in the left-hand column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0HcxIe"&gt;You may be asked if you trust the phone, first on the computer and then on the phone itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tqi2Ff"&gt;You’ll then be asked if you want to set your phone up as a new device or restore it from a previous backup. Select the latter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="A8aPY1"&gt;Whichever method you choose, enjoy your new iPhone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GH9GSw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 15th, 2021, 10:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on September 20th, 2019 and has been updated to account for differences in the OS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fqkvv"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt; mark the official end of the 64GB iPhone era: the company has effectively doubled the storage capacities for its 2021 models while keeping prices the same, so the new smartphones now start with 128GB of storage with options for 256GB and 512GB. (For those who require more space, the iPhone 13 Pro models offer up to 1TB.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k27fzt"&gt;While 64GB capacities will still stick around on the legacy iPhone 12, iPhone 11, and iPhone SE models, Apple’s newest hardware will come with a minimum of 128GB now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YrAKZ9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 and 13 Mini announced with redesigned camera array and smaller notch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Ldos8e"&gt;To which I say, goodbye and good riddance. This change was long overdue. Just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/29/16928386/smartphone-storage-memory-64gb-2018"&gt;64GB wasn’t enough to cut it in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and the issue has only grown as apps, photos, videos, and games continue to grow in size. Though Apple has offered that capacity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/10/4/2470139/iphone-4s-announced-available-october-14th-starting-at-199"&gt;since 2011&lt;/a&gt; (joining the then-entry-level 16GB and mid-tier 32GB models), it stubbornly stuck around even as Apple started to offer 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB options on its phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3usm13"&gt;If it feels like history’s repeating itself, that might be because we called out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/21/9771972/save-storage-16gb-phone"&gt;the annoyingly small capacity of a 16GB iPhone in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, too — though that time, it only took Apple one year to turn things around with the iPhone 7, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12832254/apple-iphone-7-storage-32gb-base-model-data"&gt;which offered 32GB by default&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NQT1ix"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"64GB phones aren’t big enough for me anymore","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/29/16928386/smartphone-storage-memory-64gb-2018"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="b30KGD"&gt;Apple’s own fine print points out one reason why 64GB wasn’t enough: you weren’t even getting 64GB of usable storage space to begin with, because the company’s preinstalled apps and OS take up between 11GB to 14GB right out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Px6a73"&gt;“Available space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 11GB to 14GB of space (including iOS and preinstalled apps) depending on the model and settings. Preinstalled apps use about 4GB, and you can delete these apps and restore them. Storage capacity subject to change based on software version and may vary by device.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XJR7KW"&gt;That’s one-fifth of your storage space gone, but even the 50GB or so of remaining storage gets eaten up pretty quickly given the size of modern apps and games. As &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/ios-app-size-growth-2021"&gt;SensorTower reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, the top iPhone apps are nearly four times as big as they were five years ago — continuing a &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/ios-app-size-growth"&gt;long-running trend of bigger apps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsSeG8"&gt;Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, for example, takes up nearly 4GB of storage. Apple Arcade’s &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; takes up another 4GB. WhatsApp and iMessage conversations can accumulate quickly, too — a look at my phone shows those taking up 2.7GB and 4GB, respectively. And that’s not even getting into music or videos, which can quickly take up all the free space on your phone if you download a lot of locally stored content from Apple Music, Spotify, or Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FFkOfn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apps, videos, and photos take up more space than ever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eA2OTO"&gt;And of course, there are photos and videos, which can easily take up that full 50GB on its own for prolific photographers, especially when considering the fact that improved iPhone cameras have arrived alongside more demanding photo and video formats. Apple’s ProRAW format, introduced with the iPhone 12 Pro models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;can average around 25MB &lt;em&gt;per picture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/how-shoot-trim-edit-and-share-4k-video-iphone"&gt;4K footage can pile up even faster&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;iMore&lt;/em&gt; notes that 30 seconds of 4K footage at 30fps will take approximately 175MB (or about 85MB using HEVC encoding). Shooting in HDR, as the newer iPhones support, &lt;a href="https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/turn-off-hdr-video-recording-your-iphone-12-12-pro-reduce-file-sizes-increase-compatibility-0346557/"&gt;balloons those file sizes&lt;/a&gt; even more. Apple has defaulted to 1080p video quality for years on the iPhone (which has technically been capable of shooting in 4K since the iPhone 6S), presumably to avoid complaints about running out of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bN5uts"&gt;Because Apple’s doubling your storage while keeping the starting prices the same ($829 for the iPhone 13 and $729 for the 13 Mini) those entry-priced phones are also a better deal than before. Last year, customers looking for the cheapest new iPhone got stuck with 64GB of storage, to the point it almost made more sense to just get a $999 iPhone 12 Pro (which came with 128GB from the start) instead of paying $879 to get that same capacity in the regular iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uOfKf"&gt;Of course, none of this cleanly solves the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; storage problem looming over Apple: the fact that in 2021, it still only offers customers a paltry 5GB of free iCloud storage space (essential for backing up your iPhone), something that Apple enjoys frequently reminding users about with its constant “Out of storage” notes imploring them to shell out for more cloud space. Still, the extra 64GB of internal capacity may help alleviate the issue by letting users store more photos and messages locally on their phones instead of in the cloud, leaving more space for things like device backups in the 5GB that Apple gives you for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVXujo"&gt;Hopefully, though, the change in local storage this year is a prelude of things to come; after all, that 5GB of free iCloud storage was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apps/2011/6/6/2515086/icloud-announced-apple-wwdc"&gt;also introduced a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, in 2011. Surely after 10 years, Apple might be able to find room in its heart (and its budget) for a similar increase of space? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is rolling out a new ‘5G UC’ icon for iPhones to tell when you have real 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/trrIzyhQcMhRtojb8X5MdWnBIQo=/0x19:934x642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860859/Screen_Shot_2021_09_15_at_8.24.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qe3Npq"&gt;5G branding is going to get even more confusing, soon: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1437854783184916481"&gt;T-Mobile has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be rolling out a new “5G UC” icon on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;upcoming iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; lineup to let customers know when they’re connected to T-Mobile’s “5G Ultra Capacity” network, instead of the regular old 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qF9MYF"&gt;The difference here is one of bands and brands: at T-Mobile, an unadorned “5G” icon will soon refer to the company’s low-band network, which it calls “5G Extended Range.” As the name suggests, it’s a slower network (closer to legacy LTE speeds) but it reaches a broader area. From a spectrum perspective, it exists in largely the same areas as LTE but uses 5G technologies and techniques for improved speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gO6qtH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mnPKuN"&gt;A “5G UC” icon, though, will mean that you’re either connected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325857/t-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range"&gt;T-Mobile’s mid-band network&lt;/a&gt; (which it inherited from Sprint as part of the major merger between the two companies) or its high-band mmWave network (branded as “5G Ultra Capacity”) — both of which offer dramatically faster speeds. As &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual 5G speed test&lt;/a&gt; showed this year, that mid-band coverage in particular (hitting the sweet spot of speed increase and range) has been a big contributor toward T-Mobile’s vastly improved network offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="58JHWy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone13?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPhone13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone13Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPhone13Pro&lt;/a&gt; will let &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TMobile&lt;/a&gt; customers know when they are in an area with⚡️  fast speeds with Ultra Capacity 5G!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Just keep an eye out for the below icon.   users will see it more and more as we continue to rapidly roll out this   spectrum combo. &lt;a href="https://t.co/EirfCk8pjl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EirfCk8pjl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Neville (@NevilleRay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1437854783184916481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p4LJqy"&gt;And while yet another 5G brand standard is confusing, it’s not without precedent. Verizon has been differentiating between its low-band 5G (also called “5G”) and its mmWave coverage (“5G UW,” or ultra-wideband) since it started rolling out those networks years ago. AT&amp;amp;T does something similar, too, referring to low-band 5G as “5G,” while its mmWave networks are “5G Plus.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="240QJO"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also has the unfortunate tendency to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;misleadingly refer to its LTE networks as “5G E,”&lt;/a&gt; which, unlike the other flavors of 5G on this list, is not actually 5G at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj1rXT"&gt;But T-Mobile’s change is arguably a necessary one: the rush to sell customers on 5G and slap the next-generation networking’s branding everywhere has meant that the low-band networks most people currently experience as “5G” is actually fairly similar — practically speaking — to LTE. But now that carriers are actually rolling out the bigger improvements that do bring meaningful speed and latency increases, they’re caught in a problem of their own devising: regular “5G” is too diluted of a brand to make an impact, hence the more bombastic ultras and pluses being appended to icons and logos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39Qhap"&gt;The new 5G UC icons should start rolling out soon on the iPhone 13 models once they’re released, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/po9aqn/tmobile_to_add_5g_uc_icon_to_iphone_13_when_in/hcvei91/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;last year’s iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it every year, but the iPhone 13 cameras do seem much improved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7u5nyjXL1Lj3DAf27mMr4pPXV8=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860644/i13p2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPEBtq"&gt;Cameras continue to be one of the biggest differentiators in smartphones, and Apple’s iPhone lineup is no different. Apple says the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the company’s “most advanced dual-camera system ever,” while the 13 Pro and Pro Max have “our three most powerful cameras ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dWYGH"&gt;Which you’d hope for, of course. But this year, Apple really does appear to be making a big push with its cameras, particularly with the Pro models. As ever, the question will be what Apple is able to wring out of its hardware with image processing and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQGoWi"&gt;The iPhone 13 lineup represents the first time Apple has increased the primary camera’s sensor size across the board since the iPhone XS and XR in 2018, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21515571/iphone-12-pro-max-camera-quality-features"&gt;last year’s 12 Pro Max had a 47 percent bigger sensor&lt;/a&gt; than the 12 and 12 Pro. Sensor size is a key factor in image quality because, together with lens aperture, it determines how much light the camera is able to capture. More light, less noise and blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tK52o"&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini’s main cameras have bigger sensors, which is part of the reason why it and the ultrawide are now arranged diagonally in the camera bump. Apple also added sensor-shift optical image stabilization, a feature first seen on the 12 Pro Max. It’s not clear exactly how big the 13’s sensor is, but Apple says it’ll capture 47 percent more light than the 12. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEUG2VZhfv8_aShe9BOhPHTybhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852177/i13p.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nyxfXN"&gt;The 13 Pro and Pro Max have a even bigger primary sensor and slightly faster f/1.5 lens that capture 2.2 times as much light as before, according to Apple. Again, the exact sensor size hasn’t been advertised, but Apple did give the pixel size: it’s 1.9μm, which is bigger than any modern smartphone I’m aware of. Apple can do this because the sensor is a relatively low-resolution 12 megapixels, but it’s still an impressive stat that should translate to better low-light performance. For comparison, the 12 Pro Max had 1.7μm pixels, while every other iPhone since the XS has had 1.4μm pixels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="52XSSS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple isn’t outgunning Android phones on hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n2R1t8"&gt;It’s not clear exactly what hardware changes Apple has made to the iPhone 13’s ultrawide camera; the company simply says it has a “faster sensor” that “reveals more detail in the dark areas of your photos.” The Pro does have significant hardware tweaks, though, since Apple has increased the aperture to f/1.8 for a 92-percent improvement in light-gathering capability. The sensor also now has focus pixels on board — things are rarely out of focus in ultrawide shots because the depth of field is so large, but adding autofocus means that the camera can be used for macro photography, with a focusing distance of 2cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Rwrb4"&gt;The telephoto camera remains exclusive to the 13 Pro phones, and Apple has increased its equivalent focal length to 77mm, or three times longer than the primary camera. Previously the iPhone 12 Pro’s telephoto offered 2x zoom while the 12 Pro Max went out to 2.5x. There’s a tradeoff here — if you want to frame something with 2x zoom, the 13 Pro will need to crop in from the main camera, reducing image quality. But your pictures that go beyond 3x zoom will be much sharper than before, and it should make for a better portrait lens. Apple has also added Night mode to the telephoto for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J64QBL"&gt;When compared to the Android competition, Apple isn’t doing much to outgun them on the hardware front. The large 1.9μm pixels are noteworthy, but most Android phone makers have been prioritizing big, high-resolution sensors rather than pure pixel size. Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra, for example, has a huge 50-megapixel sensor with 1.4μm pixels, meaning it has decent light-gathering ability even when shot at native resolution without binning the pixels together. And while the 3x telephoto lens is going to be useful, it’s now common to see 5x periscope telephotos (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21444946/huawei-p40-pro-plus-vs-iphone-pixel-10x-zoom-camera"&gt;or occasionally even 10x&lt;/a&gt;) in the Android world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMDyp54O2X93mx0f_YJVBUgkqvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852176/camera_system__f9pkhq4g2oy2_large_2x.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YYXY1o"&gt;So even though Apple has made meaningful hardware improvements across the iPhone 13 lineup, as ever its performance relative to competitors will come down to how well its software and image processing pipeline has been optimized. The iPhone 11 was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;hugely better camera&lt;/a&gt; than the XS the year before it, after all, even though the hardware &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/11/20860442/apple-iphone-11-camera-analysis-competition"&gt;barely changed&lt;/a&gt;. This year Apple is touting Smart HDR 4, which is capable of individually adjusting exposure for multiple people in the frame, but we’ll have to see the phones for ourselves to know what kind of a difference that makes. The same goes for Photographic Styles, a new filter-like feature that Apple says is smarter about adjusting elements like skin tones and skies in each photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIuJtD"&gt;As for video, Apple is making a big deal out of its Cinematic mode that lets you selectively adjust focus and depth of field when post-processing, like Portrait mode for photos. That’s something we’ll definitely have to test extensively. The 13 Pro, meanwhile, lets you record and edit video in Apple’s ProRes codec on the phone itself, or you can export the ProRes file to Final Cut Pro on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccov7C"&gt;All the usual caveats about waiting for full reviews most certainly still apply, but this is looking like a pretty good year for the iPhone camera. Apple is never going to have the flashiest hardware, but it’s made some welcome improvements in areas that make sense, and thankfully it hasn’t locked any features to the Max-sized iPhone. We’re looking forward to seeing the results — as well as those of looming competitors like the Pixel 6. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="W5nXzy"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;“California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; was packed with announcements, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;sixth-gen iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. We expected much of this, yet, there were a number of things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;we had anticipated&lt;/a&gt; that Apple might announce but didn’t, including new MacBook Pros and next-gen AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvt4P8"&gt;However, it looks like there’s still hope they may make an appearance soon, especially given that October is historically when Apple will showcase new Macs. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s reliable Apple-watcher, Mark Gurman, Apple will likely &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1437140403803672581"&gt;hold at least one more&lt;/a&gt; online event within the next “several weeks,” which means Apple may still reveal the no-shows from today before the end of 2021. Here are some of the more noteworthy omissions we expect to see in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cLH8qg"&gt;New MacBook Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jFiS2O"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; powered by a new &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-m1x-vs-m2-chip-what-we-know-so-far-and-what-it-means-for-new-macbooks"&gt;M1X chip&lt;/a&gt; — the rumored name for an enhanced variant of Apple’s M1 chip that made its debut last year — could make an appearance as early as next month, Gurman predicts. Rumor has it the new laptops will reportedly feature a flat-edged redesign and the return of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;magnetic MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the reintroduction of previously excised inputs like the HDMI port and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244398/apple-2021-macbook-pro-sd-card-slot-report-ports-refresh"&gt;SD card slot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7vfx8O"&gt;New Mac Minis, iMacs, and Mac Pro workstations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NkHzJz"&gt;After Apple unveils the MacBook Pro, Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;also speculates&lt;/a&gt; we may see an upgraded Mac Mini, a bigger iMac, an updated Mac Pro workstation, and even a “new low-end MacBook Pro.” Each machine will also be reportedly powered by the next generation of Apple’s in-house chips, which will “will greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,” according to Gurman’s anonymous sources. Still, there’s no guarantee Apple will unveil these before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blmZS4"&gt;Next-gen AirPods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XYABES"&gt;It was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/12/kuo-airpods-3-apple-event-tuesday/"&gt;heavily rumored&lt;/a&gt; that Apple would unveil the third generation of AirPods during its iPhone 13 event, so it was a huge surprise when the company didn’t. It’s possible, however, that we could still see these make their debut before the holiday season starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMWMyT"&gt;When they do arrive, the new AirPods will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;reportedly boast&lt;/a&gt; some of the most significant changes in form since their 2016 debut. It’s likely the new pair will mirror the AirPods Pro in design, with a new case and shorter stems. However, that may be where the similarities between the two end — noise cancellation, for example, may remain exclusive to the Pro model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZjAfT"&gt;The new AirPods are expected to retail anywhere between $150 and $200, and it’s not clear yet whether Apple will sell two different versions — one with and one without a wireless charging case — like it does with the current non-Pro AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j7cEfE"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GyvvHU"&gt;During Tuesday’s keynote, Apple announced that the next iteration of its smartwatch operating system, watchOS 8, will launch alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. macOS users, however, are still in the dark as to when, exactly, they might see the official release of macOS Monterey, the successor to macOS Big Sur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wACDT6"&gt;macOS Monterey — which was first introduced as a free update during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; and has been testing in public beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;since July&lt;/a&gt; — is still presumingly set to arrive in the fall, which what’s listed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22674369%2Fapple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The update brings improvements to FaceTime, Safari, and a slew of other apps. Monterey will also introduce features such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596970/apple-macos-monterey-live-text-intel-processors"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that allows you to control and quickly move files across multiple Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUncrx"&gt;Given the lack of Mac updates during Tuesday’s event, it seems possible that Apple could announce the release date of Monterey during the rumored event in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ILfKIWosxYvizGkz0Si0pY9KsZE=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69859316/lcimg_5ab83a83_d836_4e82_b8f5_f6ccdf0eee9f.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 has a larger display, and looks like an Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ajPTaI"&gt;One of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;big rumors heating up&lt;/a&gt; before Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;“California Streaming” iPhone announcement event&lt;/a&gt; about the Apple Watch Series 7 wound up fizzling out as soon as the new smartwatch was unveiled. The speculation was that Apple would perform the most significant overhaul of its smartwatch ever, aligning its design with that of the iPhone 12 and 13 — namely, flat sides and a more squared-off look with a larger display and smaller bezels. We got the larger display and slimmer bezels part, but the Apple Watch Series 7 still mostly looks like its predecessors at casual glance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh7XXc"&gt;The biggest change to the Series 7 is indeed physically bigger: the display. Apple increased the screen sizes to 41mm and 45mm, and with a thicker glass top the display is stronger while stretching out further to the edges. The functional benefit is more room on the screen for larger icons, and Apple says you can do and see more with more info on screen and new watch faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVz5af"&gt;Along with the screen changes, the Series 7 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;a bevy of typical year-over-year improvements&lt;/a&gt;, such as faster charging, improved durability, new workouts, new colors, and even a full swipe keyboard for fidgeting with some tiny letters on these larger screens. But even with all of that, the design feels conservative, and not a radical departure from its immediate forebears. So should you wait until Apple’s estimated “later this fall” timeframe for the Apple Watch Series 7, or do the Apple Watches of today offer enough as-is for you? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yWtSu4UACW7kFWvzFlbtzN6QQ84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850224/lcimg_d5b7c216_a765_44c8_94ea_3a59eb0563f3.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7’s colors, including a green that seems vaguely black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="alRuHC"&gt;The outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; of 2020 is still an impressively capable smartwatch, and we’ve seen significant discounts on it for months now. The polarizing red colorway has at times plummeted as low as $249, even cheaper than the midrange $279 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; that lacks an always-on display. Right at this moment you can buy a Series 6 from a variety of retailers in a color of your choice for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=verge091421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$319&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$349&lt;/a&gt;, which is a considerable amount less than the $399 starting price of the Series 7 without having to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWFRQe"&gt;Spending less right now becomes even more appealing when you consider the Series 7 may still be using last year’s S6 processor — if so, it probably won’t have an added year of OS updates over the Series 6 like you’d normally expect. One of the benefits of a new processor isn’t just the speedy improvements of today, but also the sustainability and reassurance offered down the road by an increased performance ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CvAQ2a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zhG-_eAoGQRSxsbWZoY6BmO67w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850995/applewatch_series7_typing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please don’t lie and tell me you look forward to typing on this screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5zlmpZ"&gt;The Series 7 certainly has its merits. If you prefer to have the most peace of mind, or you live a lifestyle that will really put a fitness-focused device to the test, then perhaps the new IP6X resistance rating for grittier environments and sandy beaches is enticing. If you value the fastest charging, the Series 7 comes with a USB-C magnetic fast charger, offering a 33 percent quicker charge, and even buying one of those separately will not juice up a prior generation watch any quicker. The larger displays are of course the biggest change, and if you always prefer what’s newer, bigger, and flashier then by all means keep an eye out for when preorders go up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRniGK"&gt;But this new Apple Watch still pretty much just looks like any old Apple Watch, especially at the distances people usually see a watch on someone’s wrist. What will matter most to you here might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652375/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-phones-fashion"&gt;a very personal tech or fashion accessory decision&lt;/a&gt;, and if a slightly larger screen is all you need maybe that’s good enough. Though if you’re looking for the most sensible smartwatch from Apple, you may want to consider skipping the wait and choosing from the more cost-effective options available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyQVP6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
