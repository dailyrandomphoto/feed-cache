    <title>Apple MagSafe Battery Pack review:  convenience over capacity</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Perfectly designed for the iPhone, but not a lot of charge&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mv1rms"&gt;Apple’s new MagSafe Battery Pack is a white rectangle you can stick to the back of an iPhone 12 to charge it. It’s Apple’s third run at designing an external battery solution for the iPhone and I like it better than the earlier battery cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exfu7u"&gt;However, anybody considering spending $99 on this battery ought to keep one important fact in mind: even Apple cannot break the laws of physics. It is just as bound by the same rules of magnetism and electrons as everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOZZHa"&gt;Those laws require tradeoffs: A battery that could fully charge up most iPhone 12 models would be big. A battery small enough to not look odd on a phone wouldn’t have enough juice. Plus, electrons can only flow so fast without building up heat and degrading the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="35Ynq9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple can’t defeat the laws of physics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZnHT6"&gt;Apple found a balance between all those extremes and it maintains that balance with a tight software integration that aggressively manages how this battery charges your phone. The result is a gadget that’s singularly focused on the iPhone — sometimes to its own detriment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPVBma"&gt;The best part about the MagSafe Battery is that it also serves as a fast-charging wireless MagSafe puck when it’s plugged in. So the big question is whether all that is enough to justify the price, especially compared to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IkVgoJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10664255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CY6cYp"&gt;The MagSafe Battery doesn’t have enough energy to fully charge an iPhone 12 Mini from zero to 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDUiI9"&gt;In my testing, the MagSafe Battery was fully drained when my iPhone 12 Mini reached 83 percent, which took 130 minutes of charging. I didn’t have it plugged in for this test, which meant it charged at a relatively pokey 5W speed, so as to minimize heat and maximize the battery’s longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJY99r"&gt;I used the iPhone very sporadically during the charging period (mostly to record the results every 15 minutes), though I did listen to a 15-minute podcast over Bluetooth which slowed the charging down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MSIBi"&gt;Bottom line: it’s a small battery and it will help you top up your iPhone, not fully charge it. On larger iPhone 12 models, it won’t even hit that 83 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="3oG47H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It performs better than its 1,460mAh rating would suggest&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen that appears when you attach the MagSafe Battery" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHfQPO9Akof4nKcvPy2tOkdDU2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733362/DSC02778_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen that appears when you attach the MagSafe Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGKgdGSoVtUCmkvmzsTidUJvvb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733367/DSC02789_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack on an iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RTf0Fe"&gt;There is a discussion to have about what the right way to talk about battery size is. The MagSafe Battery only has a 1,460mAh battery, but that number isn’t comparable to other batteries because it can push through more volts (7.62V). So the MagSafe Battery’s rated 11.13Wh (Watt-hours) is the number that actually matters. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TW7BRTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker makes a 5,000mAh battery with wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; and magnets for under $50. It’s rated at 18.5Wh, so the differences are smaller than they first appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5jxgt"&gt;The battery measurement discussion is interesting, but it doesn’t change the fact that the MagSafe Battery is simply small. It’s meant to be pocketable and easy to carry, and so you should think of it as something that can stretch your battery life just a little — not get you through multiple days away from a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10L4qZ"&gt;As you might expect, the software experience with the MagSafe Battery is tightly integrated into the iPhone. There are big animations that show the charge of both your phone and the battery when you attach it. It shows up on the battery level widget, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0D1sYM"&gt;More interestingly, when you first attach the battery, your iPhone will pop up a notice that this battery won’t charge your phone above 90 percent — by design. Those last few percentage points put a lot of stress on batteries, and in this context it’s just not worth it. I think it’s a smart move, but if you absolutely want that last 10 percent, you can long press the battery icon in the Control Center and tell it to charge past 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An Anker battery next to the MagSafe Battery" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpqMfamewmQtoxQWS4fzM2o6JSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733391/DSC02736_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Anker battery next to the MagSafe Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Anker battery is a bit larger, but it also has a larger battery inside." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2C2x6Q9ZfJwS723cnSduTH_uyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733395/DSC02737_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anker battery is a bit larger, but it also has a larger battery inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkVmQo"&gt;I know this sounds both complicated and disappointing, but in use it’s actually the opposite. I would just slap the battery on the back of my phone when I was worried about battery life and didn’t sweat the details. The result was not needing to keep an eye on battery life as much as I usually do. It’s elegant instead of powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I63fDm"&gt;That’s all smart, but it only happens with the iPhone. It is certainly a nicer overall experience than you’d get with the Anker battery, which is thicker to boot. But the Anker has other advantages. Its battery is bigger, for one thing. It also has a USB-C port on it that both takes charge when plugged in &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; can be used to charge devices via a wire. It’s less elegant for iPhone users, but it’s much more versatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brd6xx"&gt;The Lightning port on the bottom of the MagSafe Battery means iPhone users can keep using the same charging cable, so it’s probably the right call to keep it. It’s just too bad that Lightning can’t charge in either direction like a USB-C port can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack nearly perfectly fits the iPhone 12 Mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtsqaOrbK1sEKzSO_o-PStYZwqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733335/DSC02729_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack nearly perfectly fits the iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="klt8W8"&gt;The MagSafe Battery is designed to match the dimensions of the iPhone 12 Mini perfectly. It aligns exactly to the edges and is more comfortable to hold than I expected. If you have a larger iPhone, it will sit on the back a bit more awkwardly — it looks positively tiny on the iPhone 12 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="OC1jUe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every battery pack looks silly attached to a phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qN3kfAlg7EpFcCtrEkA3jsg5da4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733380/DSC02786_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1yuxtv"&gt;I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1417548597785202689"&gt;polled Twitter for questions&lt;/a&gt; about the battery and I was taken aback by the vitriol I saw in my replies — and elsewhere. It’s easy to make fun of how a battery pack looks on the back of a phone. It’s also easy to go after it for not providing enough charge. Having used it, I’m not sure I’d want it any larger and I certainly wouldn’t want it any smaller. To me, there’s no such thing as a good-looking external battery. At the end of the day, they’re all squarish or oblong hunks of plastic or metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yodY2M"&gt;The white plastic has a matte finish that helps a little with grip, but I wouldn’t call it soft touch. I do wonder if it’ll pick up stains from blue jeans over time, but in the few days I’ve been testing it, it’s remained clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJkFgB"&gt;It snaps on the back of a caseless iPhone with a satisfying snick. It’s as secure as I think can be fairly expected from something connected with magnets. It’d be nice if the alignment magnet was a little stronger, but I am glad that my iPhone doesn’t contain magnets so strong that it messes with credit cards. Physics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gnySp"&gt;You can intentionally shake off the battery or have it slip off when putting it in your pocket, but I didn’t have those problems. However, if you are planning on using it with a case, you absolutely need a MagSafe compatible case that itself has magnets on it. I use a very thin plastic case and that minimal layer was more than enough to stop the magnets from working effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack shows how much charge it has left in an iPhone widget" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2O_OrQpi14EUvmfjoI85z4PHeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733340/DSC02781_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack shows how much charge it has left in an iPhone widget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q6FsGU"&gt;After two days testing a couple different MagSafe Batteries on both an iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max, I came to a surprising conclusion. My favorite part isn’t the battery, it’s the MagSafe charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4oeA8"&gt;When I think of the MagSafe Battery as a MagSafe charging puck that just happens to have a battery attached to it, I think it makes a little more sense as a product. Apple’s MagSafe puck costs $40 — that certainly doesn’t make the $99 asking price for this battery a deal, but it might be worth buying the battery instead of the puck for some people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEKKns"&gt;I do have to point out that for $99 I would have expected Apple to at least include a Lightning cable. It doesn’t, nor does it include a charging brick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyPkVs"&gt;When plugged into a powerful enough wall charger, the MagSafe Battery can charge the phone at up to 15W, just like the standard MagSafe disc. The charger can fill up both itself and your iPhone. If you want to prioritize charging speed on the iPhone, you can plug &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; in instead and then the iPhone will use reverse wireless charging to top up the battery. (Unfortunately and unlike Android phones, the iPhone’s reverse wireless charging doesn’t work for other devices, like AirPods.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack can also wirelessly charge AirPods" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-CjsYo_ztMxG5Gs0F81pBS-1Azg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733349/DSC02759_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack can also wirelessly charge AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p4evuG"&gt;The MagSafe Battery’s best feature is that it is a good MagSafe wireless charger. It’s also a decent battery — but only if you think of it as a small extender, one that trades longevity for size. Do I wish it had more capacity? Of course. I also wish it could have more capacity without getting any larger than it already is. I don’t begrudge physics and I get why Apple chose the size it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk8y9b"&gt;But paying $99 for all the MagSafe Battery’s elegance and integration doesn’t make sense when there are much cheaper options that are less beholden to working with just one phone. A battery pack is going to look silly no matter what, you might as well get one that’s as versatile as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MagSafe Battery Pack teardown confirms dual-cell design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9rYSCHC435mwbloA9qNNcfMKdA=/1x0:2149x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621406/J4hYWZ4XRA.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1hjrdPuMGo" target="_blank"&gt;Charger Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zWfE7C"&gt;A teardown of Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575678/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-12-pro-mini-max"&gt;$99 MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1hjrdPuMGo"&gt;Charger Lab&lt;/a&gt; has given us our best look yet inside the new accessory, and revealed more details about how it works. For starters, it confirms recent speculation that it uses a pair of battery cells wired in series like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F34004%2Fthis-x-ray-teardown-really-smarts-iphone-11-smart-battery-cases&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F23%2F22590033%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack-teardown-dual-cell-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s previous Smart Battery cases&lt;/a&gt;, but it also gives us a look at the NFC circuitry and heat shielding within. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DguWsG"&gt;A dual-cell design is important, because it allows the voltage of the battery pack to be higher than a comparable single-cell design. While each individual cell is labelled as being 3.82 volts, the overall voltage of the battery pack is 7.62 with them wired in series. It means the pack should be capable of supplying more power than its 1,460mAh capacity would suggest when compared directly with the battery capacities of the iPhone itself, with a total power output of 11.13Wh. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/14/apples-magsafe-battery-pack-has-more-capacity-than-it-seems---heres-why"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt; has a good writeup&lt;/a&gt; of the science if you’re after more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TC4HBNfTLHpeD7OPmXiGfNZMv0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735219/J4hYWZ4XRA.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1hjrdPuMGo" target="_blank"&gt;Charger Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dual-cell design of the MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3qrhmO"&gt;Beyond the battery cells, the teardown gives us a good look at how the battery pack dissipates heat. In February, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22290938/apple-magsafe-iphone-battery-pack-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; the existence of the pack, it noted that development had been set back because the iPhone’s software kept thinking the accessory was overheating. It’s unclear if this problem was overcome with software or hardware fixes, but clearly a lot of effort has gone into keeping the pack cool while allowing it to supply enough power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61wG0z"&gt;Unlike the right-to-repair advocates over at iFixit, Charger Lab doesn’t offer a repairability score at the end of its teardowns. But the amount of adhesive and concealed tabs holding the battery pack together don’t make it look very user serviceable. We’ll have more details on how it performs in practice in our forthcoming review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MacBook Air with 13-inch Mini LED display reportedly on the way for 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tShVSGHktqXlxZJTYfxLn3SW0WA=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621226/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ImFNZq"&gt;Apple plans to announce a redesigned MacBook Air with a 13.3-inch Mini LED display in the middle of 2022, according to a new investor note from reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seen by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/22/kuo-apple-to-announce-new-macbook-air-with-13-inch-mini-led-display-in-mid-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/mini-led-macbook-air-mid-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The prediction is in line with Kuo’s &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-macbook-air-mini-led-2020-launch/"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt;, but offers a more specific timeframe. It also suggests the new Air will have a slightly smaller display than the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros that are said to be on the way this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWwrr6"&gt;Mini LED is a relatively new display technology that’s designed to offer some of the benefits of OLED — such as better contrast levels and improved dynamic range — without the risks of burn-in. It made its Apple debut &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;on this year’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo has previously listed around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163328/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-imac-ipad-pro-mini-led-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;half a dozen Apple devices&lt;/a&gt; scheduled to migrate to the new displays, including a 27-inch iMac Pro, 14.1-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, 10.2 iPad, and 7.9-inch iPad Mini. Apple is able to include the more premium displays because of cost-savings associated with using its own silicon, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/"&gt;according to Kuo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hKFOye"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new display, alongside MagSafe charging and a more powerful processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tQM0F2"&gt;Alongside the new display technology, the upcoming MacBook Air will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;reportedly feature  MagSafe charging&lt;/a&gt;, a thinner and lighter design, as well as two USB 4 ports. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the new Air will be powered by a “direct successor” to this year’s M1 processor. The new chip is said to include the same number of CPU cores, running at faster speeds, and an increased number of GPU cores. The current M1 processor is available with seven or eight GPU cores, while the new model will reportedly include nine or 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AesMuF"&gt;The new MacBook Air is likely to follow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;revamped MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, due to arrive in the third quarter of this year. The laptops will reportedly be available with 14 or 16-inch displays (Mini LED, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/09/kuo-redesigned-macbook-pro-coming-later-this-year-with-mini-led-macbook-air-with-new-display-in-2022/"&gt;according to Kuo&lt;/a&gt;) with a new, more squared off design. MagSafe charging, HDMI ports, and SD card slots, are also &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;said to be included&lt;/a&gt;. The MacBook Pro’s much derided OLED touch bar, could also finally be dropped with these models.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 owners can get six months of Apple TV Plus for no charge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nKXJSPlEO5ks0eWMlVgy89haBL0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69616772/acastro_191030_1777_appletvplus_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cKSeRI"&gt;Apple and Sony have teamed up to offer PS5 owners a great promotion on the Apple TV Plus streaming service. New and existing subscribers can get six months of service for no charge by simply opening the Apple TV Plus app on PS5 (and signing in with your Apple ID, if you aren’t a current user). After six months, you’ll be charged the normal rate of $4.99 per month to continue with the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbML5k"&gt;The timing of this promotion is no coincidence. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, Apple TV Plus’ runaway hit show starring Jason Sudeikis, is beginning its second season Friday, July 23rd. There are other things to look forward to with this subscription, like catching up on two fantastic seasons of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and getting ready for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547252/foundation-release-date-apple-tv-plus-september"&gt;a promising-looking adaptation of Isaac Asimov’s &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585674/jon-stewart-apple-tv-show-skit-roasting-space-billionaires-jason-alexander"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is launching in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZt7WV"&gt;If you have a PS5, this is a no-brainer. Tab over to the “Media” section on the main PS5 homescreen and download Apple TV Plus from there. The offer begins today and lasts through a year from now, giving you until July 22nd, 2022 to activate your six-month trial. You can see more details, terms, and eligible countries &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/6-months-trial-apple-tv-ps5-offer/"&gt;right here at the PlayStation website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDv2rg"&gt;Don’t have a PS5 yet? We know they’re still tough to find, but stay tuned for upcoming opportunities. Restocks will likely become more plentiful as we near the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing upvote and downvote buttons on tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_M1P-MIn06kHVxc6AYomsZa_Kk=/623x0:3473x1900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613644/E613I_0WEAQh4r0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sBuV18"&gt;Twitter is working on new upvote and downvote reactions for tweets to accompany the usual options to retweet and reply. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417920469265788931?s=20"&gt;Twitter confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was testing the feature for a small group of users on iOS, and it’s already been spotted according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iglehart97/status/1417912630996574208?s=20"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danlopez016/status/1417913141397127168?s=20"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; from users that are part of the test group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDaPM5"&gt;Twitter writes that iOS users may see upvote and downvotes in several different styles (up and down arrows, a heart icon and a down arrow, and thumbs up and thumbs down icons) and that it’s testing the feature to “understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo, so we can work on ways to show more of them.” Currently votes are not public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m0fQh5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some of you on iOS may see different options to up or down vote on replies. We're testing this to understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo, so we can work on ways to show more of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your downvotes aren’t public, while your upvotes will be shown as likes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hrBfrKQdcY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hrBfrKQdcY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417920469265788931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DqFZrD"&gt;While Twitter hasn’t said if it plans to add up and down voting as a permanent feature (or how voting affects what you see in your feed), there are clear parallels to be drawn to Reddit, which features upvoting and downvoting as a way of surfacing a subreddit’s favorite replies, responses, and posts. Twitter says that for now though upvotes and downvotes don’t impact the order of tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0GXxh"&gt;Twitter’s toyed with other kinds of tweet interactions in the past, including reactions that &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;appeared to mimic the emoji reactions&lt;/a&gt; Facebook uses for Facebook posts and Messenger messages. Twitter’s product lead Kayvon Beykpour has also said that the company planned to work on dislikes last year, saying the feature was “something we’re exploring” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1328761697469755392?s=20"&gt;in response to a user’s tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5kWg4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction July 22nd, 8:45AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beykpour did not say dislikes were a “top priority” for Twitter last year; he said they were being explored. Other features, like addressing harassment, were listed as &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1328761697469755392"&gt;&lt;em&gt;top priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC pledges to fight unlawful right to repair restrictions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce, Science And Transportation Committee Holds Confirmation Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZfbtWGEnAjvFfrFzdf_YMqEGuRY=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613129/1232439143.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDOho7"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission formally pledged to take on unlawful “right to repair” restrictions in a new policy statement issued Wednesday. The new policy could spell trouble for smartphone manufacturers like Apple that strictly inhibit users’ abilities to repair their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nditej"&gt;Wednesday’s new right to repair policy statement commits the FTC to encouraging competition in product repair markets with “vigor,” according to Chair Lina Khan. The statement, which was approved unanimously, makes it official FTC policy for the agency to use its existing authorities to support independent repair shops and lower repair costs for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77QymA"&gt;“While efforts by dominant firms to restrict repair markets are not new, changes in technology and more prevalent use of software has created fresh opportunities for companies to limit independent repair,” Khan said Wednesday. “These types of restrictions can significantly raise costs for consumers, stifle innovation, close off business opportunities for independent repair shops, create unnecessary electronic waste, delay timely repairs, and undermine resiliency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li1Iyl"&gt;The statement comes just days after the White House endorsed similar rules in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; on economic competition. In the order, signed by President Joe Biden on July 9th, the White House explicitly calls out smartphone makers that “impose restrictions on self and third-party repairs, making repairs more costly and time-consuming, such as by restricting the distribution of parts, diagnostics, and repair tools.” At Wednesday’s meeting, the FTC did not name any specific companies or industries that it could target in future investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2qAEj"&gt;The move was lauded by right to repair advocates like iFixit. In a statement Wednesday, iFixit’s US policy lead Kerry Sheehan said, “The FTC’s progress addressing repair restrictions shows how much momentum Right to Repair has achieved, and how powerful our community can be when we work together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j8wy9"&gt;“The adoption of today’s policy statement makes clear that the Commission will investigate unlawful repair restrictions, using the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and other consumer protection laws, as well as antitrust law to promote fair and open repair markets,” Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a statement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KImRzw"&gt;Wednesday’s open session was just the second since Khan was confirmed as chair at an agency that traditionally works behind closed doors. In the first proceeding earlier this month, Khan’s FTC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559131/ftc-open-meeting-antitrust-chair-lina-khan-sherman-act-powers"&gt;passed a pair of competition measures&lt;/a&gt;, setting the agency up to take more aggressive action on antitrust violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRBzO5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 7/21/21 at 3:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from iFixit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nobuo Uematsu’s beautiful Fantasian soundtrack is now on Apple Music</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="fantasian" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Mz7Ag417bBX1L7mAX_6kFXM5so=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69611089/1_4k.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7GvpnB"&gt;One of the most exciting things about &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;-style roleplaying game that debuted on Apple Arcade earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; — was how it reunited two industry legends. Hironobu Sakaguchi served as the creative director of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;the handcrafted adventure&lt;/a&gt;, while longtime &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; composer Nobuo Uematsu returned for the soundtrack. Now, all of that beautiful music is finally available to stream on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Falbum%2F1576490134&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F21%2F22586744%2Ffantasian-soundtrack-apple-music-nobuo-uematsu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6Fl7x"&gt;It’s a hefty album, too, with 58 songs spanning more than two and half hours of music and a wide range of genres. Prior to &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;’s release, Uematsu said that he was worried this might be his last soundtrack. “Will I get another chance to work on an entire game?” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJR1wua8OJs"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. “I didn’t want to have any regrets.” Sakaguchi expressed similar concerns, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “Let’s be honest, I’m in the latter chapters of my game development career, and each game can take years to go from conception to release.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods update to arrive later this year with iPhone SE refresh coming 2022: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csz6F4-t8Kc9zJwssBSsQVlCehg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610248/akrales_170124_1410_A_0093.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation AirPods will reportedly have a shorter stem than current models (above). &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CtMfh8"&gt;Apple will start production on updated AirPods next month, with plans to launch the third-generation earbuds later this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-to-go-all-in-on-5G-for-its-2022-iPhone-lineup"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest rumor regarding Apple’s product schedule, which will reportedly include an all-5G iPhone line-up in 2022, including a revamped iPhone SE sporting the as-yet-unannounced A15 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5QeOa"&gt;A refresh of Apple’s entry-level AirPods have been rumored for a while now, with previous generations launched in 2016 and 2019. Back in May, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the earbuds will have a design similar to the AirPods Pro, with “a new case and shorter stems poking out of the bottom of each one.” If &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; is right about production starting next month, we can expect to see the new-look AirPods revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;alongside the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; this September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4qe52"&gt;In addition to the earbuds, Apple might also release new versions of the MacBook Pro later this year, says &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;. This rumor seems pretty solid, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that the new laptops will be available in 14-inch and 16-inch screen sizes, with next-gen Apple-designed Arm processors, the return of MagSafe charging, and the end of the Touch Bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhhfLd"&gt;Looking ahead to 2022, Apple is expected to equip all new iPhones that year with 5G compatibility. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says the company will not update the smaller iPhone 12 Mini in 2022 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;disappointing sales&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/05/2021-iphone-13-name-report/"&gt;reports suggest&lt;/a&gt; it will offer an iPhone 13 Mini later this year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0zPpn"&gt;Instead, in 2022, the company will refresh the cheaper iPhone SE with 5G and an A15 processor. The updated iPhone SE will reportedly use a Qualcomm chip for 5G compatibility, an interesting note given that Apple is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168779/apple-leak-cellular-modem-johny-srouji-town-hall"&gt;building its own modems&lt;/a&gt; in order to further wean itself off third-party designs. The new iPhone SE will also reportedly keep its 4.7-inch LCD displays, says &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, making it the obvious choice for consumers who prefer a smaller device. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/2022-iphone-se-details/"&gt;Earlier reports&lt;/a&gt; about the third-generation SE said it will also retain the home button and Apple’s Touch ID sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome for iOS will let you lock down incognito tabs with Face ID</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zVFCrm"&gt;Chrome’s latest update for iOS will let you secure your incognito tabs with Touch ID, Face ID, or a passcode (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/chrome-biometric-authentication-incognito-tabs/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). When the new feature is rolled out to you, you can turn it on by navigating to the settings menu, then tapping “Privacy,” then “Lock Incognito tabs.” I just updated the app and the option wasn’t there for me, so you might have to wait just a bit until you can flip it on. Google first revealed it was testing this new privacy feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279719/google-chrome-face-id-incognito-mode-ios-support-feature"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHl2DH"&gt;The update brings a few other handy features to Google’s mobile browser, including the ability to take a full-page screenshot of a website. You can use it by snapping a screenshot with the button combination specific to your device, tapping the screenshot preview, and then tapping over to the “Full Page” tab that will appear, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/20/chrome-92-ios/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (I don’t have this feature yet, either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCbS8Y"&gt;You can download Chrome 92 &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823"&gt;from the App Store now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Space billionaires get skewered in the first promo for Jon Stewart’s Apple TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPL-gUZEuLW95reYAtW0on8g7Ks=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608088/Screen_Shot_2021_07_20_at_12.04.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jon Stewart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7uUsHO"&gt;Jon Stewart shared a video promoting his upcoming Apple TV Plus show, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s an odd one: the three-minute and ten-second clip shared on Twitter is a comedy skit roasting the recent billionaire &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585470/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-amazon-customers"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, starring Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos and a mop as Richard Branson. There are also a lot of dick jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zL6eff"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1417557259886940162"&gt;Here’s the clip, if you’re curious&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CTAh9R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry for the aborted launch!!! I’m a bad twitterer. &lt;br&gt;Enjoy this small step for man! &lt;a href="https://t.co/6gBHHJLByQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6gBHHJLByQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Stewart (@jonstewart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1417557259886940162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1LxoS"&gt;It’s unclear exactly how this might relate to the show itself, which is set to debut in September. Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371914/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; that the show would be “a multiple season, one-hour, single-issue series” and each season will have a “companion podcast” released alongside it — it didn’t mention anything about comedy sketches lampooning space billionaires. It’s also still unclear how many episodes will be included in a season or how many seasons the show will have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHi2xI"&gt;I have to say that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chelseadevantez/status/1417565284773281793"&gt;this is pretty hilarious, though&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qYIUAr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We filmed the hat weeks ago   &lt;a href="https://t.co/OsJ8iIkTdY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OsJ8iIkTdY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chelsea Devantez (@chelseadevantez) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chelseadevantez/status/1417565284773281793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WbCaMn"&gt;Apple first revealed that the show was in the works &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. Stewart’s iconic show &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart &lt;/em&gt;ended in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
