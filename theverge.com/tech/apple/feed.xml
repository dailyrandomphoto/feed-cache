    <title>Scammy iOS app discovered that refuses to open unless you give it a good review</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mJwUQO2mVOG0Bwa8r_RmzeFyMbA=/0x1:1898x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344133/E2QqsPEVUAA8_Rg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of app reviews detailing the scammy behavior.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288727349657604" target="_blank"&gt;Kosta Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; / App Store&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kxk3Bk"&gt;App developer and scam app hunter Kosta Eleftheriou’s latest discovery is a real doozy, an iOS app that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288720357679104?s=21"&gt;refuses to function&lt;/a&gt; before you give it at least a 3-star review in the App Store. Although the UPNP Xtreme app — which claimed to let users stream video to their TVs — now appears to have &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1223416942"&gt;been pulled&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to verify that it generates the App Store rating box the second it opens. You can’t dismiss the ratings box, nor can you tap the 1 or 2-star ratings, Eleftheriou said. We verified this behavior, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/prvrtl/status/1397301269279223809"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; other &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HenrickTheBull/status/1397346867965571073"&gt;users &lt;/a&gt;report they were able to dismiss the dialog box or leave a lower rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrXoCo"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars"&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; scammy app to have been unearthed by Elefheriou, who’s been waging a war against them after his own Apple Watch keyboard app, FlickType, was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011082075148291"&gt;overtaken by expensive apps&lt;/a&gt; with fake reviews. Eleftheriou says Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou#:~:text=eleftheriou%20tells%20me%20that%20apple%20has%20removed%20over%20100%20apps%20due%20to%20his%20reports%20%E2%80%94%20and%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20wondering%20whether%20his%20online%20crusade%20is%20personal%2C%20the%20answer%20is%20most%20definitely%20yes"&gt;removed over 100 apps&lt;/a&gt; as a result of his reports, but it’s concerning that the multi-billion dollar company isn’t catching these scams during its App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b9o50E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you think you can trust App Store ratings, you haven’t been paying enough attention. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the iOS *system* rating prompt, not a custom look-alike one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst part? This trick is EXTREMELY easy for any developer to do, and not limited to this app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288722706489353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QKwGD7"&gt;The UPNP Xtreme app’s behavior directly contradicts one of the best practices Apple lists on its developer site, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/requesting_app_store_reviews"&gt;which states&lt;/a&gt; that developers should “avoid showing a request for a review immediately when a user launches your app.” Generally, developers are allowed to prompt for a rating up to there times in a 365-day period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTXPiB"&gt;Apple’s review process has been under particularly intense scrutiny recently because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic Games’ lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt;. Central to the dispute is the 30 percent commission Apple takes on many App Store payments and in-app purchases. Apple argues it needs the commission to run the App Store and create a safe environment for users. But that argument gets undermined pretty quickly if obvious scammy apps are able to slip through Apple’s review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoIyyV"&gt;Apps like the ones discovered by Eleftheriou not only harm customers who end up downloading scammy software and can get tricked into paying for difficult-to-cancel recurring subscriptions. It also harms legitimate developers who have to contend with apps that are willing to play dirty to get the good reviews needed to rise up the App Store’s rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEMtkm"&gt;Eleftheriou filed a lawsuit against Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it exploits its monopoly power over iOS app to make money at the expense of app developers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero 6 and Pro 6 owners are now getting Apple’s HomeKit security features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Eero 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZRxpe6AmJTfRembxdj0gg1Nl6ZE=/0x0:1162x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342649/eero6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Eero&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaRHCK"&gt;Owners of Amazon’s Eero 6 and Pro 6 routers will now be able to isolate their HomeKit IoT devices from the rest of their home network and the wider internet, thanks to a new integration with Apple’s HomeKit that’s now rolling out (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/eero-6-routers-homekit-support/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new feature is coming as part of a firmware update, and makes the routers some of the first Wi-Fi 6 systems that support Apple’s integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGdrph"&gt;The added feature may be welcome, but it’s probably not a surprise for those who have been paying attention: Eero’s other, cheaper routers were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/2/26/21154531/amazon-eero-routers-apple-homekit-support-internet-connection-security"&gt;updated to support it in February, 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and an Eero Support account &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/jnyua3/got_new_eero_6_pro_no_homekit_support/"&gt;mentioned in November&lt;/a&gt; that the router was going through Apple’s certification process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdjsQQ"&gt;Setting up your Eero (or any other supported routers) with HomeKit lets you manage how much data your other HomeKit devices are allowed to share over the network. If, for example, you had some smart window blinds that were a bit shady, you could use HomeKit to only allow them to talk to your local HomeKit Hub, and not connect to the internet (or other apps). It’s a niche benefit, to be sure, but if you were holding off on an Eero 6 purchase until it was available, it looks like the time has finally come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbIgjS"&gt;It’s worth noting that, to use the feature, a separate HomeKit Hub is required: this can be either an Apple TV, HomePod (regular or Mini), or iPad that stays in the house. If you want to activate HomeKit on your Eero router, the company &lt;a href="https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036319531-How-to-use-HomeKit-with-your-eero-Network"&gt;has a support page&lt;/a&gt; laying out all the details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See inside Apple’s colorful new M1 iMac, thanks to iFixit’s latest teardown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1Fc9oVwTXiY7oUWw3ybKwopoK0=/0x272:6552x4640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341558/lqgEBjUUFgYXyDRU.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGTmOM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BM1%2B24-Inch%2BTeardown%2F142850%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has published a detailed teardown&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s newly redesigned M1 processor-equipped iMac, and it contains bad news about how easy the new all-in-one is to repair. Whether it’s the fans, USB ports, headphone jack, power button, or speakers, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; says virtually any repairs to the new desktop require battling through Apple’s adhesives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jf3GVX"&gt;Like the other M1 Macs, everything is soldered together now — so there’s no upgrading RAM or internal storage even if you do crack it open. The good news is if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; go through the effort of cracking it open, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; says most of the other internal parts (including the ports, webcam, and speakers) are relatively easy to swap out with replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qh_UOEv_1KUeQPgNjGj5E9PPFWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539225/h3ZxqpRyhwlebxWC.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BM1%2B24-Inch%2BTeardown%2F142850%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fNY1Rz"&gt;These problems might not matter right now while the iMacs are shiny, new, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;generally excellent&lt;/a&gt;, but they could make a world of difference in a few years when their components start to wear out and fail. &lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has long been critical of the repairability of Apple’s devices, but it’s arguably much more important for a device like the iMac, which tends to get replaced less often than a phone or tablet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called it “the computer to get if you just want to buy it and not think about it for the next five to ten years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Z1vBML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iMac M1 review: the all-in-one for almost everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="yVFrQL"&gt;If you thought the new iMac looks a lot like a massive iPad on a stand, then you might not be surprised to hear that much of what makes the iPad difficult to repair has been inherited by the new iMac. &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; has awarded the machine a total score of 2/10 for repairability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2XaNh"&gt;Apple’s M1 processors haven’t even been around for a year yet, so we don’t yet know how they’re going to hold up over time. But if any issues do crop up, this design could make it harder and more expensive for users to fix the machines they’re powering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YXogD4IJWwbFeDhrxruH5HMhCPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539226/3JkYPFl2Ta1jkuPp.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BM1%2B24-Inch%2BTeardown%2F142850%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lydcJg"&gt;This is far from the first time that &lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has criticized the repairability of an iMac. In 2015, for example, it awarded &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BIntel%2B21.5-Inch%2BEMC%2B2889%2BTeardown%2F50961&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s 21.5-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt; a low score of 1/10 for its repairability for design elements like having its RAM and CPU soldered onto the motherboard, preventing easy replacements or upgrades. Other iMacs like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BIntel%2B27-Inch%2BRetina%2B5K%2BDisplay%2BTeardown%2F30260&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;27-inch 5K iMac from 2014&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BPro%2BTeardown%2F101807&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2018 iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; fared better, thanks to their replaceable CPUs and RAM, but these are absent from the new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHVaCs"&gt;“Apple’s newest iMac follows the other M1 machines down an interesting, but even-less-repairable path,” the teardown concludes — an expected, albeit slightly disappointing direction that Apple’s ever-thinner hardware has been trending in for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VTDFrZ"&gt;

    <title>A courtroom artist’s view of the Epic v. Apple trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook gestures evocatively towards Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lE7uk8cn9Jacg8XaD-oZq211HyA=/0x220:3557x2591/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340850/IMG_2803.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Eight of the artist’s favorite sketches from the three-week court proceeding&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nMUQgm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Monday, lawyers &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gave final statements in the &lt;/em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;em&gt; case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, finishing up just over three weeks of in-court proceedings that gave an unprecedented look at how Apple manages the iOS App Store. Both images and audio from the proceedings were tightly controlled (as is often the case in federal courtrooms), so the only images came from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://courtroomartist.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;courtroom artist Vicki Behringer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, who saw much of the trial from an assigned seat to the right of the jury box. We invited Behringer to share eight of her favorite sketches from the trial, showing off both her skill as an artist and her unique perspective on the case. -Russell Brandom, policy editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Katherine Forrest gives opening remarks at the Epic v. Apple trial" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZ6LAdpYyhSupMzmAg25GAvxIrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539000/image0.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJW8Rx"&gt;This shows opening statements by Epic Games attorney Katherine Forrest. It was my first day at the trial and my first sketch. There were plexiglass barriers all around the courtroom as a COVID precaution, and the attorneys wore plastic shields covering their faces. When I saw this graphic, showing a wall being built around the iPhone, I started to understand what was at stake in this trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Epic CEO Tim Sweeney on the stand, protected by a plexiglass shield." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_abZ_CrHLf6xCQdDHVwojlzuvoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539007/IMG_2808.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L0NiV3"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is the one that started this whole case, so I knew his testimony was going to be interesting. I just loved listening to how he started the company and what the game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is all about. I had no idea. Once again, I realize there is another entire world that I know nothing about. The programming, creativity, and talent it takes to create these games absolutely amazes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5YOvO"&gt;I try to finish all my sketches within one to one and a half hours. Some take longer. I have to budget my time while I am sketching in the courtroom. I have very strict deadlines and since the news is now a 24-hour cycle with the internet, my media clients need their sketches as soon as possible to go with their stories.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKUMEo"&gt;I’ve sketched Phil Schiller two or three times now in the &lt;em&gt;Apple v. Samsung&lt;/em&gt; trials, so his face feels like an old friend. I always love hearing him talk about the history of Apple. I took my time here and decided to sketch the entire courtroom. Obviously it is not to scale. The number of people allowed in the courtroom was severely reduced, but there were still many, many attorneys to sketch, and every time a witness changed, they would play musical chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple executive Mike Schmid appears before the court." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M03qMJ_AbAmmpOuWKIxL7TnCqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539005/IMG_2797.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UE5PQ5"&gt;This is Mike Schmid, the head of Apple’s gaming department, questioned by Apple attorney Jay Srinivasan. Seeing as I am not a gamer, all of the wonderful artwork that goes into the games is quite delightful for me, but I had to move so fast that there wasn’t time to sketch it. Schmid was grilled pretty hard on the cross-examination by Epic’s attorney, but at the break they both relaxed and seemed to be happy to see each other. Maybe they were just happy to have gotten through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Craig Federighi addresses the court" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQz-0e9feCmSqvXeGXrFLgO4Cow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539006/IMG_2801.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rylrYo"&gt;Craig Federighi was a wonderful subject with his perfect white hair and dark eyebrows. People with subtle features are far more difficult, but Craig was a joy. He discussed the precautions that Apple takes to prevent its users from malware, viruses, and the like. I make a mental note to always update my software!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tim Cook gestures evocatively towards Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHtS8KG32XOlDZ9ntO10mjf0C2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539009/IMG_2803.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bgvbQi"&gt;I like this sketch because not only did I get a different angle on Tim Cook’s face (which is fantastic), but it was an important moment in his testimony. Judge Gonzalez Rogers was asking some really interesting questions of him which didn’t sound very favorable toward Apple. His confidence seemed to waver just a bit, but he answered the questions clearly and did his best to justify Apple‘s position. It felt like a pivotal point in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erO46K"&gt;I wanted to put in a gesture with the judge’s hand, but didn’t feel I had enough time. Sometimes hands can take as long as drawing the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An expert witness addresses the court, and a pie chart detailing malware infection data is displayed in the lower left-hand corner of the drawing." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qpeGL-4KRad1JwdY6NRdBdKkUN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539010/IMG_2799.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cjjq7R"&gt;The second week was mostly expert witnesses. I like the sketch because this professor had some interesting things to say about how safe Apple devices were. I know he is an Apple witness, but if his statistics are correct, it’s quite amazing! In the sketch, I added a couple of other people in the courtroom that I usually don’t have time to include. The court reporter and the judge’s deputy. When I am doing an actual trial, I try to make sure I get a sketch of everyone in the courtroom at some point. Everyone is important, even if they are not one of the main attorneys or witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A wider view of Tim Cook’s testimony, including legal representatives from both sides at the edges of the frame." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b15aw8YQ5jmXx36yPYq8PjQ6PZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539012/IMG_2805.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PxUJ9p"&gt;This is when Tim Cook first took the stand, being questioned on direct by Apple attorney Veronica Moyé. I was so nervous while sketching him because I knew it had to look exactly like him; everyone knows what Tim Cook looks like. I had studied some photographs of him and thought I was ready. Unfortunately, when he took the stand there was a huge reflection on his face shield. I could not see some of the important details. I kept peering through my binoculars waiting for him to turn his head. Finally he did and I was able to get a good view of his face. That was such a relief!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ytbVfv"&gt;I had heard this was his first time taking the stand, but I would never know it. He was quite calm, confident, and charismatic. He said so many positive things about Apple it was easy to like him. Later, I had the opportunity while finishing a sketch of him in the hallway to meet him. He seems to be a very nice man. I was shocked to see he has beautiful blue eyes. I did not realize that while sketching him — between the shadow from the light above, the reflection of his visor, and his glasses, his eyes were obscured. Something tells me I will be sketching him again since there could be more Apple trials in my future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees are going public about workplace issues — and there’s no going back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of the Apple logo in the middle of being unpeeled over a teal background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL9J39LHuK-1iR3yAFIs9RCSW1E=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340817/4599_Apple_Leaks_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Employees say the recent leaks might have changed the tech giant forever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hdqgIN"&gt;Even to the workers who wrote the letter, the leaks came as a shock. Apple employees rarely speak to the media, particularly about the company culture. In Silicon Valley, Apple operates with an unprecedented level of secrecy, managing personnel issues and product launches with complete authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWSzRq"&gt;The culture has benefits for employees. People work at Apple because they are design fanatics. The elegant hardware products are seen by many as unmatched in the tech industry. Fewer leaks mean fewer distractions and more time to focus on the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpoIWU"&gt;The company also has an aura of prestige. Working at Apple is widely seen as the pinnacle of success in the tech industry, even more than the company’s biggest rivals. If Google is a sprawl of creativity and ideas, Apple represents a workplace of organization and vision. People don’t go there for a few months or a year; they stay for decades. The tenure makes employees loyal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcSQsd"&gt;So it was surprising, to some, when the company hired Antonio García Martínez, a former product manager at Facebook who’d written a tell-all book about Silicon Valley. García Martínez’s tone in the book was brash and misogynistic — it didn’t match with Apple’s carefully managed public image and commitment to diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXCzDg"&gt;After he arrived, multiple female Apple employees went public about their concerns on Twitter — a rarity at a company where employees are discouraged from sharing their opinions about work. “I have been gutted, as many other folks at Apple were, with the hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1392618677644767238"&gt;wrote Apple engineer Cher Scarlett&lt;/a&gt;. “I believe in the strength of community we have at Apple, &amp;amp; that the culture we’ve built can weather this. I also believe in leadership to do the right thing, whatever that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wSWOAJ"&gt;Then, a group of workers wrote a letter calling for an investigation. “Given Mr. García Martínez’s history of publishing overtly racist and sexist remarks about his former colleagues, we are concerned that his presence at Apple will contribute to an unsafe working environment for our colleagues who are at risk of public harassment and private bullying,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAfjZf"&gt;Within hours, the letter had well over 1,000 signatures. It was leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That evening, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;García Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="23NoeK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Either somebody is a very good actor or there’s someone else who felt like the letter was going to disappear unless it became public.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qAV2X6"&gt;The events stunned even the letter writers. They’d expected the note to cause a stir inside Apple, but they hadn’t intended for it to become public. “The leak was very shocking to everybody who was vocal and involved in writing the letter,” says one worker who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional retaliation. “Either somebody is a very good actor or there’s someone else who felt like the letter was going to disappear unless it became public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWpPLf"&gt;A week after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published the García Martínez letter, a group of Muslim employees at Apple penned a note calling for the company to release a statement in support of Palestine. When Tim Cook didn’t respond, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;the letter was leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btgiYM"&gt;The two letters, and their leaks, are signs of a slow cultural shift at Apple. Employees, once tight-lipped about internal problems, are now joining a wave of public dissent that’s roiling Silicon Valley. Employees say this is partly because Apple’s typical avenues for reporting don’t work for big cultural issues. They also note the company rolled out Slack in 2019, allowing workers to find and organize with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDwuVf"&gt;Now, some are beginning to feel that the company culture has harmed diversity and inclusion efforts. “Apple’s secrecy works great for protecting our customers and our products, but it hinders inclusion and diversity,” says an anonymous employee. “There’s a lack of education around what is confidential versus what is your protected speech and you should speak up about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7BYeP"&gt;Public organizing, particularly on social media, has been enormously successful in Silicon Valley, allowing workers to wrestle power away from management. At Google, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/google-forced-arbitration.html"&gt;it’s led the company to end forced arbitration for all full-time employees&lt;/a&gt;. At Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;it’s spawned massive unionizing campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it seems to be Apple’s turn. “Suddenly at Apple, as everywhere else, managers can only stand back and watch as workers reshape the bounds of what will be permitted at work,” &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-hire-that-roiled-apple?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzY0NzEsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM2MzgyMjIwLCJfIjoieUhrVDgiLCJpYXQiOjE2MjE4Nzk1NTcsImV4cCI6MTYyMTg4MzE1NywiaXNzIjoicHViLTc5NzYiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.OrzoB0_ydpKdfXH27yXSKixg4BC4YNvkEg0aRslStko"&gt;wrote Casey Newton, founder and editor of &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dkfvxs"&gt;There’s no sign the leaks will extend to Apple’s product launches. This is the part of the business that Apple cares about most — and it has gone to great lengths to dissuade employees from leaking. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;sent out a note threatening to fire and even sue workers who shared product information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAbGT3"&gt;The company also has a structure in place to prevent employees from sharing — or even finding out about — product information before it’s public. Employees sign project-specific NDAs and are dissuaded from telling their spouses about their work. Their badges only open certain doors at the company’s Cupertino, California headquarters. Prior to the pandemic, most engineers were barred from taking products in development home from the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwufxD"&gt;The culture of secrecy has bled over into many aspects of Apple’s culture. But employees say it is enforced more through norms than through rules. “The habit of secrecy is self-enforcing once established,” an anonymous employee says. Most of the time, problems are escalated internally and quietly resolved without the public ever finding out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CdElUJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How do you report someone who has done something, but hasn’t done something to you specifically?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JERiFA"&gt;That didn’t happen when García Martínez was hired at Apple. Female employees weren’t sure who would care about their concerns. “For women, it was especially sensitive because the things that were being highlighted [from &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys] &lt;/em&gt;were all very misogynistic, so it felt very personal, but at the same time, who do you report it to?” asked an anonymous worker. “How do you report someone who has done something, but hasn’t done something to you specifically?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjuKx4"&gt;Apple employees are quick to point out that they’ve been organizing internally for years. In 2020, they pushed the company to move away from using the terms “master” and “slave” in engineering contexts where one process controlled another, part of an &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-confronts-use-labels-master-slave/"&gt;industry-wide shift away from the labels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8h1YG"&gt;They also called for Election Day and Juneteenth to become paid company holidays in a letter last year. “Apple is one of the most influential companies in the world,” they wrote. “While there is undeniable momentum behind the Black Lives Matter civil rights movement, we can and should be setting a better standard for other companies to follow. We believe we have an opportunity with Election Days to be a leader that forges ahead of the rest.” The push was largely successful. On July 24th, 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-24/apple-to-give-employees-paid-time-off-to-vote-in-u-s-election?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the company was giving workers four hours off to vote on Election Day. Employees in the United States get Juneteenth off this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NVAHl"&gt;Apple management might not love what is happening — it’s not very Apple-y, after all — but if employees maintain their secrecy surrounding its products, the firm might not care enough to crack down. Workers can tweet about Apple, just not Apple products. And they likely will: as one anonymous employee told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in the wake of the García Martínez letter, “I think this has forever changed the culture of Apple.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1U7ks"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzihcGwATCdsY0OUrDD7qarx8kQ=/255x0:2145x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339545/TIDAL_on_Apple_Watch_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tidal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o5Ek5G"&gt;Music streaming service Tidal is now available &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2FAppleWatch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453031%2Ftidal-apple-watch-offline-listening-spotify-deezer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, allowing subscribers to stream music directly to Apple’s wearable or download it for offline listening. Instructions on how to get set up can be found on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2FAppleWatch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453031%2Ftidal-apple-watch-offline-listening-spotify-deezer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tidal’s site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443522/deezer-apple-watch-offline-listening"&gt;Deezer&lt;/a&gt; both announced similar offline listening features for the Apple Watch last week. Subscription prices for Tidal start at $9.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpKOR7"&gt;Tidal has historically sold itself on the quality of its audio streaming, offering features like lossless playback and even hi-res streaming before many of its bigger rivals. But this year, some of its biggest competitors are starting to catch up. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify’s lossless HiFi tier&lt;/a&gt; is set to launch later this year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;Apple Music will introduce support&lt;/a&gt; for lossless and hi-res streaming next month. Tidal’s high audio quality won’t translate to its Apple Watch app however. The music service has confirmed audio will be limited to 96Kbps on the wearable, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;like Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f8uVMB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tidal is facing renewed competition from Spotify and Apple Music&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4wHzl"&gt;The service’s other major selling point is the amount it pays artists in royalties to stream their music. Analysis &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/12/25/streaming-music-services-pay-2019/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Digital Music News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; puts Tidal’s rates ahead of Spotify, Apple, and Deezer, and it looks like this artist-supporting trend is set to continue after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;Jack Dorsey’s financial services company Square recently acquired a majority stake&lt;/a&gt; in the streaming service for $297 million. Dorsey specifically cited wanting to find “new ways for artists to support their work” as the reason for the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YV11Ry"&gt;“Square created ecosystems of tools for sellers &amp;amp; individuals and we’ll do the same for artists,” the CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460914149003271"&gt;tweeted at the time&lt;/a&gt;, “We’ll work on entirely new listening experiences to bring fans closer together, simple integrations for merch sales, modern collaboration tools, and new complementary revenue streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ewwp6Q"&gt;Tidal’s Apple Watch support requires a Series 3 model or later running watchOS 7.1. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flexibits’ contact app Cardhop gets fresh revamp, added to Fantastical subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_KBwBLItdssAbe70WYumqc-wRgE=/332x0:2495x1442/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338916/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.22.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntEZaa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://flexibits.com/cardhop"&gt;Flexibits&lt;/a&gt; — best known for its popular calendar application, Fantastical — has a new, overhauled version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16488490/cardhop-contacts-app-announced-fantastical-flexibits"&gt;contact management application Cardhop&lt;/a&gt; out today, which updates the app with new features and a fresh coat of paint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okjI9n"&gt;But most importantly, like Fantastical before it, Cardhop is also switching to a subscription model. The contact app is being added for free to the existing Fantastical Premium subscription that Flexibits introduced last year. And to mark that expanded scope, Fantastical Premium is also getting a new name: Flexibits Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rAnGkz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS and Mac calendar app Fantastical is moving to a subscription model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21109700/fantastical-flexibits-subscription-service-premium-price-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DCOHPu"&gt;The original Mac and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18280578/cardhop-app-contact-management-ios"&gt;iOS versions&lt;/a&gt; of Cardhop previously cost $19.99 and $4.99, respectively. However, similar to Fantastical, Flexibits will now be offering a more limited, free version of both of those applications to anyone, with more advanced functionality (including many of the new features being introduced with the new version of the app) locked to subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfNZuv_zi4IjQXJbNHchfh2ibdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536968/cardhop.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RE0l8s"&gt;Flexibits, crucially, isn’t changing the price of its subscription program to go with the newly added app. Flexibits Premium will still cost $4.99 a month or $39.99 a year for an individual user, or $7.99 per month or $64.99 per year for up to five family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8Z4FH"&gt;Existing Cardhop owners will still be able to access any features that were already present in their existing apps from before the switch to the subscription model without having to pay (also similar to the Fantastical switch). They just won’t get any major &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; features going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNwhgPAJDRHlzRw1gHLZ9GMK9Ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536973/Relationships_Family_Tree.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mqKU3I"&gt;Cardhop 2.0 does add a variety of new features, though. There’s a new Relationships mode, which can generate family trees for contacts that you’ve set relationships between or — if you have Google or Office 365 accounts linked — org charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDkunN"&gt;The iOS version of Cardhop has a new business card scanning feature, which does exactly what it says on the can, and there are new widgets for both macOS and iOS that can be customized to add quick links to call, text, or interact with a contact using any of Cardhop’s actions. (Want a link to quickly FaceTime a friend? Now you can.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idww5freXqEprE-bD1SNNdphMoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536965/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.22.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SDYFJq"&gt;And given that Cardhop and Fantastical are now bundled together, there are also some deeper ties with the Flexibits calendar app. A new “Invite with Fantastical” action makes it easy to invite contacts (or whole groups of contacts) to events. Scanning a business card also gives an option to quickly follow up with an instant calendar meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrT2Ek"&gt;The new version of Cardhop is available to download now for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple stayed on message while Epic filled out the record</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8klKtHRvaVYWrvOmobOmGIRUsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69336515/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1FSSBv"&gt;Sure, “hot-tubbing” &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; fun, but in a court context, it’s just a judge encouraging lawyers to argue — which is how &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ended today. Not with a bang but with a quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbuGmB"&gt;In honor of the trial’s final day, a raft of spare lawyers were in the gallery, representing Epic and Apple. But everyone who spoke to the judge — Epic’s Gary Bornstein and the three lawyers who handled the end of the case for Apple, Dan Swanson, Veronica Smith Moye, and Richard Doren — had their backs to the gallery the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OU1n2W"&gt;Throughout the trial, Epic’s general strategy appears to have been to stuff the record as full of evidence as possible — just in case it’s needed on the inevitable appeal. To do that, Epic sacrificed telling a coherent story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4vmxWH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple had a clear story and it spent the entire trial hammering it home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AxNHLE"&gt;Apple, on the other hand, was on brand. It had a clear story and it spent the entire trial hammering it home: Apple controls the App Store because the alternative would be a security and privacy nightmare. Whether it was Swanson, Moye, or Doren at the podium, this story didn’t waver, just as it mostly didn’t waver throughout the rest of the trial. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Tim Cook biffed this&lt;/a&gt; by citing a business model and not mentioning security.) Phil Schiller, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;Apple’s marketing guru&lt;/a&gt;, sat at the table with the lawyers throughout the trial; from time to time, I found myself wondering how involved he was in crafting the lawyers’ messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDbVsS"&gt;Both parties agreed that the top two issues of the day were market definition and remedies. Who you will agree with in the end is going to depend on how the market is defined, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bt1hH4"&gt;For Epic, we’re talking mobile app stores, and the question of the operating system on the phone is key. After all, even though Samsung and LG and whoever else make phones, from a developer’s point of view that doesn’t matter. You’re making games for Android or iOS. This seems fairly sensible, particularly after Schiller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;cited extremely minor competition&lt;/a&gt; in his testimony: Amazon’s Fire tablets and Microsoft’s failed Windows phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X57l1x"&gt;It is less clear to me why game consoles should be excluded as competition. Apple, obviously, wants to say there’s a &lt;em&gt;great deal&lt;/em&gt; of competition — but to tell the truth, my initial reaction to this antitrust trial was, “But can’t you just play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on a console?” Epic’s Bornstein mentioned that most consoles aren’t mobile; as the owner of a handheld Nintendo Switch, I strongly disagree! Bornstein had, of course, thought of this — the Switch doesn’t connect to wireless networks, he said, and thus is not truly “mobile.” By this standard, anyone who owns an iPhone that has the functionality for data over the cellular network switched off — perhaps because they are a child and a parent handled this setting, or perhaps because they are just cheap — also doesn’t truly own a mobile phone. That seems incorrect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6o8Lwo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“But can’t you just play ‘Fortnite’ on a console?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0myP52"&gt;Hilariously, Apple’s Swanson pointed out that it is not the ‘90s. What he meant was that we don’t just have one device — multiple devices are much more the norm than they used to be. If all these devices are substitutes for each other, then what does it matter to users if they have to use a PC or a console to get to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;? Some testimony we heard from Apple’s experts earlier in the trial suggested that 80 percent of iOS players were making their in-app purchases elsewhere, Swanson reminded us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARkpvM"&gt;The reason the market definition matters so much is clear: if I agree with Apple’s view that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a game, and the competitive market is basically anywhere I can buy a game, Epic has no case. But if I agree with Epic’s view that the relevant market is mobile app distribution, then Apple’s refusal to allow any apps that aren’t in the app store on the iPhone is pretty unquestionably monopolistic. This is where Epic’s failure to tell a clear, simple, and coherent story sets its case back. Even if I agree that Apple has at times deliberately hamstrung its competition — and I do agree with this, otherwise there would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;no green bubbles on iMessage&lt;/a&gt; — I still can’t say in simple language why consoles aren’t an acceptable substitute for gaming on mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipjXDh"&gt;But leave that aside. I’m not the judge, after all! And Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers pointed out that it was possible Epic’s proposed remedy — allowing other app stores onto the iPhone and allowing side-loading of apps — &lt;em&gt;destroyed&lt;/em&gt; consumer choice. After all, she suggested, people are generally aware of Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem and are choosing it on purpose. Besides, she noted, the cost of apps in Google’s store was roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF8g7z"&gt;Well, Epic’s Bornstein said, that’s because it’s a duopoly. There is only one place in the record where Apple concerns itself with pricing pressure: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418828/apple-app-store-commission-30-percent-phil-schiller-2011-epic-lawsuit"&gt;a 2011 email from Schiller&lt;/a&gt;, asking if at some point Apple may have to lower their commission. Apparently, pricing competition still hasn’t caused Apple to lower its commission, unless a lawsuit counts as “competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zYgfwN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This line of questioning suggested that Gonzales Rogers agreed there isn’t competitive pressure on Apple’s pricing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="batGhH"&gt;See, Apple’s small developer program, which dropped the commission for certain studios, seemed to be the result of &lt;em&gt;this lawsuit&lt;/em&gt; more than anything else. (“The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Gonzales Rogers said last week&lt;/a&gt;.) This skeptical line of questioning suggested, at least to me, that Gonzales Rogers agreed there isn’t competitive pressure on Apple’s pricing. That’s probably welcome news for Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nsP7c"&gt;The day’s other hot topic was remedies — if Apple does indeed have a monopoly and is acting anti-competitively with it, what should be the outcome? Epic wanted to prohibit the restrictions that make the App Store the sole option for downloading apps on iOS — which would mean allowing both side-loading and other game stores on the iPhone. Epic also wanted to get rid of the requirement that in-app transactions for digital goods must use Apple’s in-app purchase processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBo2lk"&gt;To Apple, this just meant that Epic wants to use Apple’s IP — like developer tools — without paying for it. After all, Apple’s Doren pointed out, the company could have only allowed its own apps on the iPhone, as it did with the very first one (which was promptly jailbroken so other apps could be loaded, but never mind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gq9539"&gt;Gonzalez Rogers seemed skeptical about the remedies. Besides the IP question, which there was a healthy back-and-forth about, she asked Epic’s Bornstein to cite some cases where courts required businesses to totally change their business model. Well, there’s Microsoft, Bornstein said. Yes, but that case had been brought by the government, and Epic is not the government. In fact, Gonzalez Rogers said, Epic hadn’t shown her a single comparable antitrust case where the kind of ruling Epic was requesting had been granted by a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gtNJV"&gt;Setting aside the fact that I am not a mind reader nor a judge, what I heard in court today didn’t sound like a win for Epic. Yes, the record is stuffed full of times Apple behaved badly. But the question isn’t whether Apple has always behaved well. I walked out of court feeling Apple had the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYxTTz"&gt;Of course, all the evidence Epic crammed on the record may serve them beyond an appeal. After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;Amy Klobuchar has said she’s watching this trial closely&lt;/a&gt;. So even if Epic loses this battle, its strategy may win the war — by creating new antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.6 now available with new Apple Podcasts subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ynrvr-lLBWkVE-FcWLjMfyREk2g=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334814/bfarsace_201106_4269_002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFiP3s"&gt;Apple is releasing its latest iOS 14.6 update today, and it’s largely focused on audio improvements. This new OS update will allow Apple Music subscribers to enable lossless audio or Dolby Atmos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;once it’s available next month&lt;/a&gt;, and it also debuts Apple Podcasts subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnw8CA"&gt;Podcasts users can now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;subscribe to content&lt;/a&gt; in the app for extra perks like ad-free and bonus content, as well as early access. Apple is also improving the Podcasts app with the ability to mark all episodes as played, recover old episodes, and remove downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6cqHT"&gt;iOS 14.6 includes a number of other quality-of-life improvements. If you’re an AirTag owner, iOS 14.6 includes the option to add an email address as a contact method for when the item tracker is in lost mode. There’s also Apple Card Family sharing, with support for up to five people to share an Apple Card for purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8fYXO"&gt;As always, this latest version of iOS also includes some fixes and security improvements. Apple has fixed an issue with the Apple Watch not unlocking an iPhone correctly, problems with reminders as blank lines, call blocking extensions not appearing in settings, reduced iPhone performance during startup, and Bluetooth issues during calls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly hit with campaign by pro-Palestinian activists leaving 1-star app store ratings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration Facebook, Inc. logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tbcxN_kZXw2OFymE7bzIv9W9j2s=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69331565/1233004792.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iny5gO"&gt;A social media campaign by pro-Palestine activists has pushed down the ranking for Facebook’s app in Apple and Google’s app stores, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The activists are seeking to protest Facebook’s alleged censorship of Palestinian accounts on its platform, and are instructing people to leave Facebook’s app a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Skkyy__/status/1394588317900025858"&gt;one-star review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50MaNh"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NBC New&lt;/em&gt;s, Facebook is treating the situation as a high-priority issue internally; one software engineer wrote in a post on an internal Facebook message board that “users are upset with our handling of the situation,” adding that the users “have started protesting by leaving 1-star reviews.”  Facebook has reached out to have the reviews removed, but so far, Apple has declined the request to remove the reviews. It’s not clear how or if Google responded to the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRbdQF"&gt;The rating for Facebook’s iOS app on the App Store as of Sunday afternoon was 2.3 stars out of 5, with 1-star ratings far outpacing others. In the Google Play store the situation was similar; the Android Facebook app had a slightly higher 2.4 rating, with the majority of the reviews 1-star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvjnPi"&gt;Apple and Google did not immediately reply to requests for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4ezoe"&gt;Facebook did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but a spokesperson said in a statement to&lt;em&gt; NBC&lt;/em&gt; that the company does not censor it users, but applies its policies equally “regardless of who is posting or their personal beliefs.” The spokesperson added that the company has a dedicated team that includes Arabic and Hebrew speakers who are “closely monitoring the situation on the ground, who are focused on making sure we’re removing harmful content, while addressing any enforcement errors as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrUndz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvXQbz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
