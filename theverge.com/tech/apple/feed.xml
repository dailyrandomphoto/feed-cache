    <title>Halide’s latest update brings the iPhone 13 Pro’s Macro Mode to older iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzUynfgZ0Yy2u-5dFqIZcRbXLGk=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959756/macro_mode_halide.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Halide&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFyEUx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide/id885697368"&gt;Halide&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best photography apps on the iPhone, and the company has just updated its app with a new macro feature, designed to perfectly complement the new macro mode that Apple added with this year’s iPhone 13 Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dlozy"&gt;But Halide’s 2.5 update doesn’t just add support for the iPhone 13 Pro’s existing macro feature that Apple made. It takes things a step further and adds a macro mode for older iPhones, too, using Apple’s Neural Engine for “AI-based detail enhancement,” which uses a neural network to squeeze extra detail out of the close-up shot, even when you crop in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iK9cub"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10792972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iAwKxX"&gt;The “official” macro mode on the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max uses the new ultra-wide lens that Apple offers on its more premium models, which — unlike the ultra-wide on the regular iPhone 13 models or older iPhones — add an auto-focus mode that makes the ultra-close up photography possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBeYID"&gt;Halide is mimicking that effect in two ways: first, it determines what camera lens on your device can focus the closest, and then the app offers “sub-millimeter” focus control to get the perfect shot. Then, it uses the aforementioned “Neural Macro” feature to upscale the image, allowing for sharp photos even when cropped in by 2x or 3x. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3O4TRY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not quite as good as the iPhone 13 Pro, but it’s a fun tool to try&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LgNRc"&gt;To use Macro Mode in Halide, you’ll first need to update your version of the app to Halide 2.5 from the App Store. Then, tap the “AF” button to toggle off autofocus, which brings up the manual focus menu, where you’ll be able to tap a new flower icon to enable Macro Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npllIL"&gt;I was able to briefly test out a beta of the new update on my iPhone 12 Pro, and the results are pretty impressive. It’s still not quite on the level of the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro capabilities — there are still limits to what the older hardware is physically capable of doing — but it’s certainly a better solution than simply holding your phone close to your subject and hoping for the best and a fun tool to play around with. And while I don’t have an iPhone 13 Pro handy to test with further, Halide says that its Macro Mode enhances that feature for even better macro shots, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15mnFcycsVzK9vyP6wWxBWm6vo4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905014/IMG_3350.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9MbsQ"&gt;The new Macro Mode addition works on any iPhone that offers Apple’s Neural Engine (which includes the iPhone 8 and all subsequent releases) and is a free update for Halide owners. Halide itself can be downloaded for free from the App Store with a seven-day free trial and can be purchased for either $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year subscriptions or a flat $ 49.99-lifetime price upfront. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Mini and 13 Pro Max battery life: better, and a beast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5bN9JrrWVoGrb85ECDRZSMH3Ehw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959185/vpavic_211004_4792_0005_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13 Pro Max | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NnSuEM"&gt;I wanted to spend more time with both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; before I weighed in with a final verdict on their respective batteries. I’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;updated my full reviews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;of each&lt;/a&gt; to reflect my impressions after using them for a couple weeks, but I figured it might be helpful to lay out what I’m seeing separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TRy85"&gt;The long and the short of it is that, in both cases, the batteries exceeded my expectations. Apple really did improve on the feature that matters most to most people: these phones last longer than their predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySnwSW"&gt;It’s easy to talk about the battery life on the iPhone 13 Pro Max. It’s ridiculous. It goes and goes, lasting so long that I had to actively work to kill the thing in less than a full day by just shooting a bunch of 4K video to drain it. I think the majority of people will be able to get well into their second day of use before the battery warnings pop up. And I’m talking devil-may-care use, doing whatever you want without concern kind of use. It is, as the headline implies, a battery beast.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro Max battery lasts a very, very long time. Screen-on time can clear 10 hours." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dadgdYndc2z3NCqOCsESrVqQwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863261/akrales_210917_4760_0331.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro Max battery lasts a very, very long time. Screen-on time can clear 10 hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4DEch"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is a more complicated story. I think that if you’re the sort of person who isn’t completely glued to their screen for much of the day, you’ll find that at the end of that day, the 13 Mini will still have some juice. That’s a definite improvement over last year’s iPhone 12 Mini, but it nevertheless still doesn’t last as long as larger phones — including both the iPhone 13 or even last year’s iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vuqH3t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 and 13 Mini review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"},{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2Dz1cz"&gt;In my initial review of the iPhone 13 Mini, here’s what I had to say: “The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic both in size and also in how much you use them.” The difference this year is, instead of having to make major changes in my phone habits, I only had to make modest ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRGkit"&gt;You may have seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQQCoJiZj8w"&gt;this excellent battery rundown test&lt;/a&gt; from Arun Maini (aka Mrwhosetheboss). Maini’s video is excellent because through the entire timelapse, you can see exactly what activities the phones are doing as they drain down, and it’s a big array of stuff. His result has the iPhone 13 Mini outlasting last year’s iPhone 12. I don’t have the two to compare directly myself, but in my daily usage of the Mini this year, my battery life hasn’t been quite that good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lmOtVr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQQCoJiZj8w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3STxh"&gt;This is all very fuzzy, but that’s the nature of battery testing in the real world. We all use our phones differently, and so predictions are necessarily vague. But the fact that we use our phones differently is the point: the iPhone 13 Mini is a phone that I believe &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be used differently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q72GubsK29ZL7erXjL73Erpry6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865101/vpavic_210918_4760_0703.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini’s battery life is much improved, but not so much that you can use it as much as you would use a larger phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TtyHha"&gt;As with the iPad Mini, the smaller screen here subtly influences your behavior in ways that aren’t immediately obvious. Even though it runs the exact same software as the 13 Pro Max, the iPhone 13 Mini encourages more sporadic use for shorter periods just because it’s smaller and less immersive. If you can adapt your phone usage to fit, it’s great — and definitely better than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqdIXv"&gt;The same insight applies to the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Its gigantic screen also encourages a different kind of use — specifically more of it. But because it simply can have such a huge battery inside (and perhaps because it can vary the refresh rate of the screen), those behaviors don’t affect how long it lasts as much. Physics is physics, and the battery in the 13 Pro Max is physically huge. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;So are bigger cameras&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ar2R52"&gt;What, really, do you want out of a new phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAdrAJ"&gt;Assuming you’re starting with a good foundation, I think the list of what really makes a big difference in phone upgrades is actually short. The first thing on the list is improved battery life. The second is an improved camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmuVya"&gt;Those are the two things that make a fundamental difference in your day-to-day experience of a smartphone (assuming, again, that the basics don’t stink). Those are also exactly the things Apple tried to make better in the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLmhHh"&gt;Those two improvements come on top of the major changes the company introduced last year with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. If you already have an iPhone 12, this year’s update looks iterative because it is. If you have an older iPhone, the full list of what’s better on the iPhone 13 is almost too long to enumerate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zm6VCR"&gt;The iPhone 12 brought new technologies and a fancy new design (and a new, Mini-sized version). The iPhone 13’s battery and camera updates aren’t so flashy, but they’re more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ca6nT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 5th, 2021 to include results from longer-term testing with the iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jTlL1X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10764114"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="POELcK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10790047"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13, in pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IL8t4x"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini design and specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5SAQtt"&gt;Unless you look very closely, it’s difficult to tell the difference between the iPhone 13 devices and their predecessors. The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini introduced a striking and new flat-edged design that I still believe is a massive improvement on what came before. And of course, the iPhone 12 Mini was the first phone in a long time to bring a truly great experience to a smartphone with a smaller form factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOAz8c"&gt;They also switched over to OLED screens, which offer a superior experience to the LCDs that came before in several ways: contrast ratio, brightness, and power efficiency. They added 5G. They added the MagSafe charging system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHf9VU"&gt;It’s worth revisiting all those big changes because people are hanging on to their smartphones for a longer time now — especially iPhones. I think it’s fair to give the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini credit for the design they’re based on since so many of the people that are likely to buy them will be new to what the iPhone 12 offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fnVRC3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini keep last year’s new design, which is still beautiful and modern&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ad7gks"&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some changes to that design, however. The newer iPhones are just a tiny bit thicker overall, with substantially bigger camera bumps. That means that cases designed for the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini are unlikely to fit the newer phones. The camera bump is not only thicker, but the lenses have been rearranged to accommodate the giant new sensor that’s in the main wide-angle camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOjSnL"&gt;The last change is that the notch housing FaceID and the selfie camera has been shrunk down by 20 percent — but don’t get too excited by that. It’s only been reduced on the horizontal axis, so the extra screen you get doesn’t amount to much (and Apple isn’t using it to show more info, like battery percentage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijCuBt"&gt;There is a new processor inside the iPhone 13: the A15 Bionic. As usual with iPhones, it’s difficult to discern significant speed improvements, but that is only because there’s so much headroom that iPhones tend to feel fast for longer. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Pro&lt;/a&gt; models get one more GPU core than the regular models, but I haven’t noticed that make a difference at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGFILf"&gt;One difference that does matter this year: the base storage on the least expensive iPhone 13 and 13 Mini has been increased to 128GB. I’m frankly impressed that Apple actually managed to proactively increase the base storage on its own — historically, it’s always done it far too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNUALy"&gt;Finally, my favorite design improvement over the iPhone 12 is that there’s a new pink color option. Of all the colors offered on the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro lines, it is the best one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhbF73GPv-Zly2J-mcpTx4bMdD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863274/vpavic_210916_4760_0323.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UzmY4E"&gt;iPhone 13 battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DyoBG1"&gt;Battery life on last year’s iPhone 12 wasn’t quite what I had hoped for. Battery life on last year’s iPhone 12 Mini was sadly exactly what I was expecting: not very good. So for this year’s iPhone 13, Apple did the obvious thing: it made the batteries bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i3hCp"&gt;Those larger batteries (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;9 percent on the iPhone 13 Mini and 15.1 percent on the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;) are the main driver behind Apple’s battery claims this year. It says that the regular iPhone 13 should last for a whopping two-and-a-half hours of usage longer than the iPhone 12, while the Mini will last an extra one-and-a-half hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjzzSH"&gt;Of course, if you don’t have an iPhone 12, then the 13 lasting more than two hours longer is kind of meaningless. My takeaway for the regular iPhone 13 doesn’t require relative comparisons, though: battery life is &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="D80PRl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life on the regular iPhone 13 is excellent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The best iPhone 13 color is pink." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bz6C5n_5q6wqP6YwubUJe0TiFTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865100/vpavic_210917_4760_0702.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best iPhone 13 color is pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SZq1pC"&gt;On one day of my testing, the regular iPhone 13 made it from 7AM to midnight before it tuckered out. That was with some camera testing, watching some video, the usual doomscrolling, emails, work, and some games. It was an intense set of work for the five hours of screentime that day, so that’s impressive. On another day with lighter usage, I didn’t see the battery warning until the following morning. But the iPhone 13’s battery isn’t magic. When we had a day of a lot more 4K video testing, I was looking for a charger by 7 or 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gpsctz"&gt;As for the iPhone 13 Mini, its battery life is much improved over last year’s 12 Mini, but not quite enough for me to throw caution to the wind and recommend it to anybody who wants a smaller phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG1uGw"&gt;With last year’s 12 Mini, I had to significantly change my phone usage to get it to last through an entire day. This year, I only had to modestly change my behavior. I think that if you’re not glued to your screen for many hours a day, the 13 Mini crosses a line of battery usability the 12 Mini didn’t quite manage to even approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDdZcZ"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic, both in size and also in how much you use them. If you are constantly using your phone all day, the smaller battery in the Mini isn’t likely to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUdOYU"&gt;My takeaway on the Mini is to not assume the improvements are enough to overcome the fundamental physics of smaller batteries. My takeaway on the regular iPhone 13 is also based on fundamental physics: a big battery means good battery life.TKENDNEW&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mx8zAg"&gt;iPhone 13 cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="we6MM5"&gt;Both the iPhone 13 and the 13 Mini have the same camera system: a regular wide-angle camera and an ultrawide. Both have been upgraded, but the major improvement comes to the wide angle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsoUUi"&gt;Just like the battery, the improvement to the wide-angle camera sensor is simple: make it bigger. A bigger camera sensor is able to take in more light more quickly and produce better results. Apple happened to have just such a sensor lying around: the one from last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fL0gC"&gt;That’s notable because the 12 Pro Max stood apart from all the other iPhones last year by having a larger sensor, and now that sensor is the new default this year. And from the moment the 12 Pro Max was released up until now, it has been the best smartphone camera on the market for both photos and video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In bright light, it can be difficult to see the improvement over last year’s iPhone 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VjTrGuWAMFmPyScPTB9djo0A8Yo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865823/reg_IMG_349707.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In bright light, it can be difficult to see the improvement over last year’s iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fs2dYr"&gt;I am happy to report that the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini match or improve on those results. Details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Since the 13 and 13 Mini have the best camera sensor from last year’s 13 Pro Max, night mode performance is excellent" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wK3aL7SdxtoZdNYIDKstB8elqXI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865828/reg_IMG_353019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the 13 and 13 Mini have the best camera sensor from last year’s 13 Pro Max, night mode performance is excellent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 has good color reproduction at night, though it can tend to yellows sometimes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JM7TdrsrLJYm9dbvXOZlnwz7cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865827/reg_IMG_352918.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 has good color reproduction at night, though it can tend to yellows sometimes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vOttW3"&gt;Video quality is great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow mo and handles them all super well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZvLuN"&gt;Really, the only way to be unhappy with this camera is to compare it head to head with an iPhone 13 Pro — and even then, I think you’d probably need to do it on a big screen with images taken in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBEaB7"&gt;The ultrawide sensor was also updated for better low-light performance, but it’s fairly minor. What I mostly see is improved white balance and color when it’s in night mode. That’s something I’ve noticed across the board, actually. Especially in low light, colors are a bit more true to life than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ultrawide is much less noisy in dark photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WQUFAlvJMYpW4d7efE8tKjYWaL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865826/reg_IMG_352216.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultrawide is much less noisy in dark photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 13 and 13 Mini have the exact same camera system" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IATdIRnXlBrQ6psXbjhzPFBu__M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865825/reg_IMG_351411.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13 and 13 Mini have the exact same camera system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lw3g2e"&gt;My main wish is that the selfie camera sensor had been updated. It has some software improvements just like the other cameras, and it’s inside a smaller notch now, but the selfie camera is too important for Apple to just leave the same this many years in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRzGOJ"&gt;Apple has also introduced two new camera modes with the iPhone 13: Photographic Profiles and Cinematic Mode. I have gone in depth on both of those features in the iPhone 13 Pro review, so you can read the full details on how they work there. But I’ll briefly describe each here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="diFHrJ"&gt;Photographic Profiles are a new option in the camera that change the default look of the picture you’re taking. You can customize the tone and contrast of how all the pictures you take look instead of doing it in edit after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJvyOk"&gt;You may know that Samsung phones take super vivid photos or that Google Pixel phones take photos that are more contrasty and blue. With Profiles, Apple is essentially admitting that people may prefer those looks and is providing an option to get them automatically.  You can also customize each one to your own personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EAxJoO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764403"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14G7Xz"&gt;Profiles aren’t like filters in that they don’t apply tone and warmth settings to the whole picture. The iPhone knows when it sees grass or faces or sky, and so it adjusts how it applies those color preferences accordingly, so you don’t get weird-looking skin tones or purple skies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s27evH"&gt;Photos taken with a Profile can’t have adjustments removed or changed (beyond normal editing) after the fact, and you can’t use RAW at the same time as profiles. It’s handy sometimes to think of them as presets, and I think I will use them from time to time. Apple claims that the A15 Bionic is necessary for the whole Profiles experience to work, but my feeling is that it ought to be possible to get this feature on older iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXGPhT"&gt;Cinematic Mode is a new feature that is essentially the equivalent of Portrait Mode but for video. It locks on to a face and blurs the rest of the scene, just like if you were using a lens with a big aperture. But it then tries to change the focus as it sees fit, shifting over to a face in the background if a face in the foreground turns away, for example. As you shoot the video, you can manually change focus yourself, or you can do it after the fact in the edit — but only inside Apple’s own apps like Photos or Final Cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSqAOZ"&gt;The results from Cinematic Mode are nowhere near as good as Apple’s own commercials would have you believe. It doesn’t work well (or really, at all) in low light, and it has the same problems you may remember from the early days of Portrait Mode photos: weird cutouts around hair and glasses. It also only works in 1080p at 30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="37B8pX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764406"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="czKzIA"&gt;But don’t let the fact that Cinematic Mode doesn’t live up to the hype distract you. The camera systems on the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini are excellent. If there wasn’t also the iPhone 13 Pro in the world, they’d be the best you could get on a phone as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4G3eE5B21Pg_Xg9awwQwwBAsnHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863273/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RAOPHA"&gt;I think it’s all too easy to look at the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini and not think much of the updates this year. Cameras get better every year, and every company promises good battery life, after all. And compared to the massive changes we saw on the iPhone last year, the 13 looks iterative, more like an iPhone 12S than truly new models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KV4QJn"&gt;I won’t pretend that reading is totally wrong, but I also think it misses the point. Fancy new features are fun, but the fundamentals of battery life and camera are more important. Because if you focus on the fundamentals, your whole game gets better. And the iPhone 13 has got some good game. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Smooth operators&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lVLDlO"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are phones designed for people who care about the details. The improvements over last year’s iPhones are significant but not obvious at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYOJiC"&gt;Just as with the regular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the most important upgrades on the 13 Pro are to battery life and the camera system. The 13 Pro adds a third major improvement with a high refresh rate screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZy42V"&gt;Upgrading the battery, camera, and screen sounds like an iterative, yearly update; they sound like the so-called “S” updates that Apple used to do for iPhones before its naming schemes became unpredictable. And it is true that the design is virtually identical to that of last year’s iPhone 12 Pros. But those assumptions — those words — don’t quite do justice to how big the changes really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MmKXr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 5th, 2021 to include results from longer-term testing with the iPhone 13 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SieXlO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10764115"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HDtzdX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10790048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ny6ArzeT0abX7U_ZwlO2TJfb_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863285/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gMdpOS"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6BiRNN"&gt;The change that’s most likely to make the biggest impact for the most people is battery life. Apple is happy to tell you that the battery improvements come from a constellation of updates, including increased efficiency in the new A15 Bionic processor and changes to how the new display uses power. I am sure all that is true, but I’m just as sure that the biggest contributor is simply that the batteries are bigger than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDhFmY"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;13 Pro has an 11 percent larger battery, and the 13 Pro Max’s battery is an astonishing 18.5 percent larger&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s quoted improvements over the 12 Pro models are one and a half hours more usage on the 13 Pro and two and a half hours on the 13 Pro Max — and the 12 Pro Max was &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; a battery life monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Scpobu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The battery life improvement isn’t complicated; it’s a bigger battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ln2RL"&gt;I’ve only had the phones for a little less than a week, so I focused most of my use on the smaller iPhone 13 Pro as a kind of worst-case test. And my results are in line with Apple’s claims. On a day when we really pushed the phone with lots of 4K video and max brightness on the screen, it still lasted from early morning to 11PM with 20 percent remaining — with somewhere north of four hours of very heavy use in the screen time tracking app. A day with less intense usage clocked me at seven hours of screen on time before the low battery warning kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B0meV"&gt;As for the iPhone 13 Pro Max: it is a beast. I can’t seem to kill this phone off in a day without intentionally shooting a ton of 4K video. It lasts even longer than last year’s Pro Max. I normally hesitate to enthuse about battery life because people’s phone usage can vary so much, but I can confidently tell you that the 13 Pro Max will get most people well into their second day. That extra battery adds some weight, but I think it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WII3Gv"&gt;Bottom line: I have much more confidence walking out of the house for a long day without carrying an external battery pack. For me, the line a smartphone needs to cross is that I trust I can get through a normal day without battery anxiety. Both the 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max easily get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bLp7mtnBqNSAknvlWtvU99sTY0M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863286/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RQlOiN"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro design and specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="occrhj"&gt;Last year was a big design update for the iPhone, with flat sides, 5G, and MagSafe charging. This year’s models inherit all of that, changing the design in only minor ways. The most obvious one is the notch on the screen. It’s slightly smaller, but only horizontally — it still pushes down into what you’re looking at to the same degree. Apple also didn’t do anything with that extra space at the top, meaning you still can’t see your battery percentage without pulling down the control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK7xVY"&gt;The other design change is that the new iPhones are almost imperceptibly heavier and also thicker across the entire body compared to last year’s models. But the camera bumps on both phones are significantly bigger, which means that 12 Pro cases are not going to fit on the 13 Pro. I think the tradeoffs are worth it for the improved battery life and camera system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="pcyWDI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The design is virtually identical to the iPhone 12 Pro models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The smaller notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) compared to the 12 Pro Max (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2z2yR_DeXfOX9MEg6-o6IBv9j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863283/vpavic_210916_untitled_0004.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The smaller notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) compared to the 12 Pro Max (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PMFKfj"&gt;Unlike many Android phones with gently curving displays at the edges, Apple does still have a small bezel around the screen. The rails on the edges are glossy stainless steel that pick up fingerprints, the glass on the back is a smooth matte. The front uses Apple’s Ceramic Shield finish to prevent cracks, and the camera lenses are sapphire. It’s a beautiful phone, and I think it’s a huge step up from the curved sides we’ve seen on iPhones from the 6 all the way up through the 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpGUZC"&gt;The important spec outside of the camera system and the screen is the new A15 Bionic processor, which is indeed fast. But as always with iPhones, the primary purpose of that speed is ensuring the phone will still feel fast in years to come, not making it seem faster than last year’s device. There are a bunch of camera features that seem to be enabled by the A15, however. I’ll also just point out that the 13 Pro models get five GPU cores to the regular 13’s four, but that extra core doesn’t seem to enable anything specific beyond more speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l76YW8"&gt;Base storage still starts at 128GB, but at the top end, there’s a new 1TB option. That is a ridiculous amount of storage for a phone, but if you’re planning on shooting a bunch of ProRes video, then it might be something to actually consider. Screen sizes and resolutions are the same: 6.1 inches at 1170 x 2532 pixels for the 13 Pro and 6.7 inches at 1284 x 2778 pixels for the 13 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hoSEK"&gt;In terms of networking, Apple is focused on expanding support for Mid-Band 5G — the kind that will actually matter more than the UWB version that’s only really available on certain street corners. All that really means is that in the US, the 13 Pro is ready for a 5G future that could come if carriers keep their promises (they haven’t so far, but maybe next year). As usual, if you travel a lot, you should keep an eye on the bands available on the &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/watch-out-with-iphone-13-there-are-now-5-different-iphone-models-by-country"&gt;several variants that are sold in different regions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OPPFI"&gt;Finally, although I know it’s a lost cause and that I sound like a broken record, I still believe that Apple should switch the iPhone from the Lightning connector to USB-C. I also still believe Apple made a mistake by not taking advantage of the obvious opportunities to do so with the big iPhone X and iPhone 12 redesigns. I understand the reasons why it hasn’t switched, and I disagree with them. Especially on a “Pro” phone, the standard cable would be incredibly convenient and useful for both charging and connecting other accessories without adapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-51a5mInUeU_ZboyZk_s8FIAOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863264/akrales_210917_4760_0441.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8HH3XY"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XjydBk"&gt;The camera systems on the iPhone 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max are identical this year, which means you don’t have to buy the bigger and more expensive phone to get the best photos.  And I do mean best photos because there isn’t another phone on the market that can match the iPhone 13 Pro. (Google’s upcoming Pixel 6 hasn’t been released as of writing this, of course, but it will have its work cut out for it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQNuIQ"&gt;Apple’s marketing for the camera system on the 13 Pro is that it’s the “biggest advancement ever.” I don’t know that I would go that far, but I also can’t remember the last time I’ve said “whoa, look at this photo” as many times as I have during this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="f6FaKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best cameras on a smartphone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwoSXP"&gt;I will start, however, by pointing out that this camera system is one of the things I’m referring to when I say that the 13 Pro is a phone for people who pay attention to the details. In bright sunlight or normal light, the pictures these phones take are very hard to distinguish from the iPhone 13 or even the iPhone 12. In good lighting, almost any high-end smartphone is very competent these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tB58i"&gt;Where the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main wide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike Android phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then “pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is sticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since 2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and features 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve seen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an f/1.5 aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9snyn"&gt;All of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a massive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with some tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography, the low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Color reproduction in darker scenes is much improved compared to last year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHDLat"&gt;There’s less image noise in low light and more dynamic range in low and even medium light. Apple also tells me it has adjusted how it handles the black point, so shadow exposure is more accurate now, too — the 13 Pro is just more willing to let darks be dark while accurately exposing lighter areas. In situations the 12 Pro would aggressively hop into night mode and lighten everything up, the 13 Pro often doesn’t need night mode. And when the 13 Pro does drop into night mode, it goes through that exposure process twice as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0qEtF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763684"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JEN10O"&gt;We used this word last year in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;12 Pro Max review&lt;/a&gt;, but I think it applies even more this year. The camera on the 13 Pro is &lt;em&gt;confident.&lt;/em&gt; As computational photography has become the norm over the past few years, I have seen lots of camera systems — including on the iPhone — just sort of panic and do the wrong things with exposure or tone. The iPhone 13 Pro has almost never done that in my testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SsHBzJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Is8rtY"&gt;Let’s bring things back to earth. Will most people notice the quality difference between the 13 Pro and the regular iPhone 13 or even last year’s iPhones? Most of the time, I think the answer is actually no. On phone screens, you really have to zoom in and pixel peep to see it. But if there’s any place where I think it makes sense to call an iPhone “Pro” as in “for professionals,” I think this main wide angle camera is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrLtfy"&gt;The ultrawide camera also got an upgrade in terms of taking in more light, but it’s not as dramatic a difference. A more interesting upgrade is adding autofocus to that camera, which allows it to pick up a new trick: macro photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Macro mode kicks in automatically at around 10cm from a subject" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idnl0a8E2FeczI16Oy53UzoyQbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864666/pro_IMG_022307.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macro mode kicks in automatically at around 10cm from a subject&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ultrawide camera has better low light performance, but not dramatically so" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JECJG9xniss22pVNWNxDdoZ_xlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864676/pro_IMG_388931.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultrawide camera has better low light performance, but not dramatically so&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6Bqd7"&gt;When you bring the phone in close to a subject, you can see the camera frame switch over to the ultrawide when it’s about 10cm away. It tries to keep the same basic framing with a crop, but apparently, not everybody is enthused: Apple emailed us the night before the review to say it would ship a software update later with an option to disable the automatic switchover. Then you can keep pushing in until you’re as close as 2cm away and still have an in-focus shot. The photos it takes are better than the bespoke, throwaway macro lenses on many Android phones these days. It’s a fun feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6s3uz"&gt;The wide angle camera has gotten the most impressive upgrade, but my favorite is the new telephoto lens. Apple has set it to a 3X zoom, the equivalent of a 77mm focal length and up from the 2.5X / 65mm in the 12 Pro Max. That extended zoom does mean that it drops to an f/2.8 aperture (from f/2.2), but whatever low light losses that entails are more than made up for by the addition of night mode for this lens. Apple isn’t playing the superzoom 100X game; instead, it’s focusing on quality at the 3X optical zoom for things like portrait photography. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new telephoto lens takes amazing portrait photos, but takes some effort to get good shots in low light" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylna0kEm-Pig_PHBswqpjhrljDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864680/pro_IMG_016205.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new telephoto lens takes amazing portrait photos, but takes some effort to get good shots in low light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxz8xA"&gt;And that quality is incredible. I simply love taking photos of people with the telephoto at 3X now, getting a natural bokeh effect without having to engage the software portrait mode. The telephoto lens gets the award this year for most improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V3fn2f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10763698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8hwkE4"&gt;Apple has held the crown for best smartphone video for a very long time now, challenged (but not losing) only briefly by the Samsung Galaxy Ultra series phones in the last year or two. This year, video quality is simply amazing, at least on the wide angle camera. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization instead of just OIS makes for stable and beautiful footage even in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QxNQn"&gt;Apple will also let you shoot video in ProRes this year. I didn’t have much time to test that, and ProRes isn’t really a part of our video workflow. But it’s there if you buy an iPhone that has enough storage to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFmse8"&gt;I’ll state it plainly because it bears repeating: the iPhone 13 Pro has the best camera system on any smartphone available as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Photographic Profiles make the iPhone take photos that look more like what Samsung and Google’s phones take" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N2QfiFHTQ51U-p_4X3AdX1z2Fhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864295/IMG_0281_2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic Profiles make the iPhone take photos that look more like what Samsung and Google’s phones take&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xNMM6c"&gt;Photographic Profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TUVWr1"&gt;Apple has added two new camera modes to this year’s iPhones, both Pro and regular. Each is fascinating in its own way. Cinematic Mode is essentially Portrait Mode but for video, while Picture Profiles change the default way the iPhone takes photos. Picture Profiles are particularly interesting because they serve almost as an admission that Apple is feeling competitive pressure from the likes of Samsung and Google, so let’s start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5cJno"&gt;Profiles are a new setting in the camera app that change the way your photos look by default. So instead of applying a filter after the photo is taken, you can set your iPhone to have a specific kind of “look” right away. In fact, Apple insists that Profiles are not filters at all, for reasons I’ll get into shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1v5ctq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dad4CO"&gt;The default options for Profiles include Standard, Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm, and Cool. Each one has its own little sliders that you can manually tweak for both Tone and Warmth. If you tweak those sliders, the name of that profile cleverly changes to match your settings (my personal favorite name is “Rich Cool,” because I imagine that’s Apple’s target demographic). When you set one of these profiles, it becomes the new default way the camera takes pictures, though it will also pop up a button that lets you toggle it off. (The button is also clever, the way it looks changes based on what profile you’ve set). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlWvlf"&gt;The TL;DR for Profiles is that “Rich Contrast” makes the iPhone’s photos look more like a Google Pixel, with bluer tones and deeper contrast. And “Vibrant” makes the iPhone look more like a Samsung phone, with more extreme colors all around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WbYvA"&gt;Historically, Apple has insisted that what it aims for in photography is the “truth” of what your eye would see. I will (regretfully) set aside philosophical questions about the nature of objective reality and what a photograph is and instead just point out that it’s fair to say that when it comes to photography, Apple is much less opinionated than the competition. Samsung and Google are both more willing to tune their images to be more pleasing to their customers than Apple is. With Profiles, Apple is essentially giving its customers the option to get pictures they like better without having to edit them after the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic Profiles on iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="usyFdq"&gt;Understanding how Profiles actually works is a little complicated. Apple’s computational photography process is called Smart HDR, and what it does is standard across many phones these days: it takes a bunch of photos at different exposures all at once and then combines them into a single, final image. Part of that process involves making choices about white balance, color, contrast, and so on. Another part of that process is the iPhone semantically recognizing different things in the scene — things like faces, people, grass, sky, cats, or whatever and exposing them differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qspoht"&gt;When you set a profile, the iPhone makes different choices during the Smart HDR capture about white balance, color, contrast, and so on based on the preference you set. It also uses that semantic recognition to make better choices for things like skin tone. That’s why it’s not a filter — it’s not applied evenly across the entire image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye3iOb"&gt;Profiles are not something you can undo in the edit — though Apple does label them in the metadata when you view them in the Photos app. You should also know that you can’t shoot with profiles and have RAW output on at the same time. Unlike a RAW photo where you can make all sorts of choices in the edit, Photographic Profiles lock your choices in to the file as it’s saved. In theory, it might be possible for the iPhone to save all of that extra data, but Apple tells us that it would create huge files that it wouldn’t be worth it for ordinary use and that people who do want to edit after the fact can just shoot RAW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Editing a Cinematic Mode video on an iPhone 13 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LupFP9L_lzgIe3ei24wHEchPr4s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864301/Screenshot_2021_09_20_at_8.46.04_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editing a Cinematic Mode video on an iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pxIe2Z"&gt;Cinematic Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HkyZIA"&gt;Apple’s flashiest iPhone ads are for Cinematic Mode. It’s an entirely new mode for iPhone video that uses software to blur the background of a video, much as Portrait Mode does for photos. Unlike Portrait Mode, Cinematic doesn’t take advantage of the iPhone 13 Pro’s LIDAR sensor for creating a depth map — it just uses software to recognize human faces and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5BFX5"&gt;The reason Cinematic mode makes for such a great demo is that it can automatically shift the focus when something happens in the scene. It locks on to the biggest face that it sees, but if that face turns away, the iPhone can automatically shift focus to somebody else in the background. It is fun to play around with and works with both the rear and front-facing Selfie cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Es4aQ"&gt;You can also change the focus point as you’re shooting by tapping something in the background and lock focus by tapping again. And then, after you’re done shooting, you can change your focus decisions moment-to-moment in the Photos app and even change the amount of background blur for the entire video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cinematic Mode is limited to 1080p and doesn’t work in low light, despite what Apple’s ads show" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ANjnyRUm4phHT-0w1eXsBHm6Cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864316/cinematic.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinematic Mode is limited to 1080p and doesn’t work in low light, despite what Apple’s ads show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tY3mZT"&gt;Because it’s the equivalent of Portrait Mode for video, it can have the same problems as Portrait Mode for photos — it rarely works in low light, for example. (Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/apple/status/1438955425265696775?s=21"&gt;own ads for Cinematic Mode show it working in low light&lt;/a&gt;, which I find misleading.) It can also have weird or bad cutouts around hair, which is a little less noticeable because it’s video, but it’s still there. Finally, Cinematic Mode &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works in 1080p at 30FPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9nPrp"&gt;Cinematic Mode really only works well within Apple’s own ecosystem of apps. The depth map information is saved into an ancillary “sidecar” file that goes alongside the video, but only Apple apps like Photos or Final Cut can do anything with it right now. If you AirDrop it to a Mac that isn’t running macOS Monterey, the iPhone will bake all your depth choices into the file before sending it along. Apple tells us that it hasn’t worked with third-party companies like Adobe or Lumafusion to make that data editable in those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPU6ht"&gt;I think Cinematic Mode is crazy fun, but I’m not sure how much value it really adds to people who want to use their iPhone for actual, professional video work. I’m not going to say it’s a gimmick, but it is gimmick-adjacent. Like Portrait Mode in photos was at the beginning, Cinematic Mode feels like it’s a few years away from being truly useful for anything beyond casual use. Despite Apple’s promos, I have a hard time believing real movies will be made with this in its present state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The LTPO displays on the 13 Pros have high refresh rates — finally" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E01KlIJ2W7CxDhf2e731K95T_C0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863263/akrales_210917_4760_0384.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LTPO displays on the 13 Pros have high refresh rates — finally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5NYQWg"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max displays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="T0cjec"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max finally offer iPhone users a screen feature that flagship Android phones have had for quite a long time: higher refresh rates. Apple’s branding for its screen is “Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion,” and the important part is the ProMotion, which previously has only been on the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCwRPY"&gt;Historically, the iPhone has been able to refresh its screen at 60Hz (or 60 times every second), but the new iPhone 13 Pros can vary the refresh rates from as little as 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz. Apple is using a type of OLED display called LTPO (&lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/666267/what-an-ltpo-display/"&gt;Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide&lt;/a&gt;) panel, technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;first seen on Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt;. It has a wide dynamic range, can get much brighter, and also uses less power because it can ratchet down the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcoWDq"&gt;What all this means practically is that scrolling and animations look much smoother. It also has battery life benefits because if nothing’s moving on the screen, the screen needs to refresh less often and therefore uses less power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Ni8VQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple waited too long to introduce high refresh rate displays on its Pro phones, but it has implemented them well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T22XNY"&gt;None of this is news to Android users, but if you haven’t used a high refresh rate display on a phone before, it can be a little hard to explain why it makes a difference. This is doubly true on iPhones because Apple has gotten away with not putting a high refresh rate screen on an iPhone for so long because iOS is itself a very smooth OS without very much jank in its animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7on6Wr"&gt;When I scroll on the iPhone 13 Pro, the text stays readable instead of turning into a blur. Things moving on the screen are smoother. It feels more like a direct interaction with my finger because the iPhone can literally change its refresh rate to match my movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv2at6"&gt;Apple’s implementation is also smart: iOS keeps an eye on what activity is happening on the screen and adjusts the refresh rate to match. So the screen matches the 24FPS frame rate in video apps, for example. Apple tells me apps coded with its default tools like Swift will get these benefits for free and that developers will have access to tools to update their apps to support ProMotion if they like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ved8rg"&gt;I get if all this sounds very silly. It is very much a premium feature that is more about experience than anything practical. That’s exactly what ProMotion is, and it is exactly what I think we should expect from a phone that costs more than a thousand dollars. It was a similar story when Apple’s own high-density Retina Displays hit the scene. Once many people experienced the nicer thing, they were bothered by its lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59ronC"&gt;I have heard all the speculation about why Apple waited this long to implement this feature, and I don’t really buy any of them. I admit that high refresh rates are the epitome of “nice to have,” but part of the point of Apple’s extravagant Pro phones is to provide the nicest experience. Now, finally, they do. Crucially, Apple did an excellent job with its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro (left) and Pro Max (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ekFDxMXU0-GMcxYU4CYwEStQFpE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863288/vpavic_210916_untitled_0058.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qLs5Lq"&gt;The ProMotion display is the perfect example of what you get with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max. It’s an improvement that may only matter explicitly to a few but will subtly make life nicer for everybody who uses it. The battery life upgrade isn’t quite so subtle, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4679X"&gt;As for the camera, I can see it both ways. When you’re sharing photos and videos to social media and looking at them on a phone, the differences &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; subtle at most — but they’re there if you look for them. And if you use your iPhone’s camera for more than just Instagram, you’ll appreciate the updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nf4R3E"&gt;The list of significant things I have to complain about with these phones is almost astonishingly short. (Though, as you might expect, I can quibble for days about little things like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;lack of a meaningful MagSafe ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, the lightning port, or how iOS 15 handles notifications). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ven5Ti"&gt;The story of the iPhone 13 Pro is a story of iteration, sure, but iteration &lt;em&gt;matters&lt;/em&gt;. iPhone 12 Pro owners will have to pay a lot of attention to see some of the differences, and an upgrade probably doesn’t make a lot of sense. But if you’re using something older, all that iteration comes on top of the major improvements from the iPhone 12 Pro — the upgrades will be very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tk2gK9"&gt;Either way, when you start to pay attention to the details, prepare to be impressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hi9GQZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10764169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="lqP68B"&gt;At $499, the latest iPad Mini isn’t cheap. Luckily, Adorama is &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?subId1=VergeDeals100621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmk7r3lla.html"&gt;currently taking $25 off&lt;/a&gt; of the 64GB, Wi-Fi-equipped model in all four colorways, bringing the final sale price down to $474. The latest model is equipped with Apple’s new A15 Bionic processor and a 12MP rear camera, not to mention Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; feature, which allows the front-facing camera to digitally pan and zoom in order to keep you in the frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iILOjK"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we also praised the design of the sixth-gen iPad Mini, the larger screen, and the fact that the new tablet offers USB-C support, though, we disliked that it lacks a headphone jack. And while today’s discount isn’t a huge one, it is one of the first we’ve seen on the Apple slate since it launched just over a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PV32lk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKeMiP"&gt;If you’re in need of a stylus, you can pair your discounted iPad Mini with the second-generation Apple Pencil, which is once again &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDealsRoundUp10062021&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Woot&lt;/a&gt; until October 9th, or while supplies last. Typically $129, you can pick the stylus up for $110, which is just $10 more than its best price to date. Amazon Prime members will get free shipping. Unlike its predecessor, the newest Apple Pencil can wirelessly charge while magnetically attached to the side of the latest iPad Pro, iPad Mini, or iPad Air. Note that it will not, however, work with the newest entry-level iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwQZni"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XLZY02"&gt;You can now purchase the best drone under $1,000 for even less at Newegg. DJI’s official Newegg storefront is now offering a refurbished &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeDailyDeals10062021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F380-0002-003U1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI Mavic Air 2 Fly More Combo for $769&lt;/a&gt;, and throwing in a $60 Newegg gift card. Normally $988 when sold new, that equates to $219 in savings. The Mavic Air 2 offers 34 minutes of flight time, as well as a built-in 48MP camera that is far better than that found on its predecessor. The midrange drone also offers features like ActiveTrack 3.0, which automatically follows a subject, as well as improved connectivity. In addition to the drone, the discounted bundle includes an AC power cable, a pair of extra control sticks, a shoulder bag, six low-noise propellers, a battery-to-power bank adapter, a gimbal protector, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21243887/dji-mavic-air-2-2020-drone-flight-photography-video-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6NnCMn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10791622"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e0pq3w"&gt;Apple aficionados, you’re in luck today: we’ve got a third Apple discount for you. Right now, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?subId1=VergeDeals100621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmgyl3ama.html"&gt;Adorama is selling Apple’s AirPods &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/e4ENXr"&gt;Max for $449&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of colors. That’s a $100 discount and one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on what we believe are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now. As noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the AirPods Max boast excellent sound quality, top-of-the-line noise cancellation, and a breathable knit mesh headband canopy that makes them comfortable to wear over long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AAGYen"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9ff9q"&gt;If the $474 iPad Mini above seems too expensive, Amazon is now selling the ad-supported, 32GB version of the latest Amazon Fire HD 10 at its lowest price to date. Normally $150, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BX7FV5L/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can buy it today for $100&lt;/a&gt;, and get a 20 percent extra discount if you trade in select devices. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22578620/amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-productivity-bundle-kids-pro-2021-tablet-review-which-to-buy"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we liked the tablet’s sharp, colorful screen, while noting that it offers good battery life for the price. It’s a good buy if you’re on a budget and would like a tablet strictly for watching movies or consuming Amazon content, however, keep in mind that we may see even steeper discounts as Black Friday approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="833xuZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Verge Tech Survey 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWXX2_W2TVY4Kb4tZJd2CXgcb0U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958423/VRG_ILLO_Verge_2021_tech_survey.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;After a year of the pandemic, we asked Americans if their trust in big tech companies has changed — and if the biggest ones should be broken up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="piUnNR"&gt;In a year of isolation, fear, sickness, and death, the tech industry provided many of the ways people stayed connected. It also made Americans very aware of their reliance on the major tech companies. So have our attitudes toward them shifted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83udey"&gt;Starting in 2017, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has conducted periodic surveys gauging Americans’ attitudes toward the major tech industry; our most recent one was published in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21144680/verge-tech-survey-2020-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, just before life was upended by the novel coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L28OTc"&gt;Though the pandemic has changed a lot of American life, our findings reveal that it mostly hasn’t changed our feelings about tech companies. There are some exceptions, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Qb3RYv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10790939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LzvnWk"&gt;Thirteen percent of respondents who were familiar with the brand had unfavorable opinions of Amazon, compared to just 9 percent in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zOybLS"&gt;The estimation of Facebook and Twitter also fell among people familiar with them — with 34 percent saying they had unfavorable opinions of Facebook, compared to 29 percent in 2020, and 42 saying they had unfavorable opinions of Twitter, compared to 39 percent in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gf8UjH"&gt;More people said Apple had a negative impact on society, but that was still just 9 percent of respondents familiar with the brand, compared to 5 percent in 2020. Facebook and Twitter were also more likely to be viewed as bad for society among those who recognized the brands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mulUXC"&gt;Among people who don’t use Facebook, 43 percent of them are avoiding it because they don’t like how it does business — a jump from 27 percent in the last survey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wC4FNM"&gt;These are surprisingly large shifts in just a year. 2020 was a record profitable year for Amazon as more people relied on it during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ouXbO"&gt;We added a new company, TikTok, to our survey this year: 31 percent of people who recognized the brand say it has a negative impact on our society. Also, it’s the brand people most distrust when it comes to personal information, since 64 percent of respondents say they don’t trust it. Facebook and Instagram are the second and third least-trusted brands when it comes to personal information; in both cases, a majority of respondents indicated that they felt the brands were untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myig0N"&gt;There is also an increased interest in breaking up Big Tech. This year, 61 percent of our respondents said that the government should split up tech companies if they get too big; last year, only 56 percent of people said that. Maybe the pandemic drove home how much we rely on these businesses — and how they can change our lives at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIheF1"&gt;These are among the findings of the third &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Tech Trust Survey. This survey was conducted in August with 1,200 people nationally representative of the US. The sample error is ± 3 percent at a 95 percent level of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbKqT9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvAlm4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It just got much easier to find your lost AirPods Pro or AirPods Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiEaheHIUyePl5myAyfcl8nUEuA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956595/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ynre3Q"&gt;Apple today released a firmware update for its AirPods Pro and AirPods Max that introduces new options for finding the pricey products if you happen to misplace them. These capabilities were first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;promised for iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; but didn’t quite make the launch; thankfully, it didn’t take Apple much longer after that to roll them out. Both &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/05/apple-rolling-out-new-find-my-features-for-airpods-pro-and-airpods-max/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/05/airpods-firmware-find-my-updates/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on today’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CF4dO"&gt;Using Apple’s Find My app, it was already possible to view the location where your AirPods were last paired with your iPhone or play a sound to make them easier to dig out of the couch cushions. But this new update greatly expands that functionality. Now you can activate Lost Mode and have millions of other iPhones, iPads, and Macs aid in the search should your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max go missing. If they come within Bluetooth range of another Apple device, you’ll be alerted to their location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoGMMd"&gt;Apple has also added an AirTags-like “Find Nearby” user interface for tracking down a set of AirPods Pro or AirPods Max if you know they’re somewhere close. Since there’s no U1 chip inside Apple’s earbuds or headphones, it’s not quite as precise as with an AirTag; you don’t see the arrows pointing you towards them, but the onscreen prompts will show statuses like far, near, or “here” when you’re right near them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAYsXz"&gt;Also super helpful: you can now automatically receive a notification if you leave your AirPods behind somewhere. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210515"&gt;support page on the Find My network&lt;/a&gt; explains the various features and how they work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPau41"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple still doesn’t offer any straightforward way to update AirPods firmware. It just sort of &lt;em&gt;happens &lt;/em&gt;randomly when they’re connected to your iPhone. But you can at least check what version you’ve got to see if you’ve got these latest features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B0cZUY"&gt;Go to Settings on your iPhone or iPad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uBfxAq"&gt;Tap General, then About&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="612SpH"&gt;Choose AirPods, and in there, you should see a “firmware version” field. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="giiE1G"&gt;The new update that offers the improved Find My capabilities is version 4A400, so look for that. As for the regular AirPods, they’re still limited to the more basic functionality that was present before. But whenever the long-rumored third-generation AirPods make their debut, hopefully those will also offer the more robust location tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s healthcare division leaned on misleading data, report alleges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iZ93EsHt1XJiciYHKVkgpQsj-AI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955506/acstro_190902_apple_event_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bEcnjw"&gt;Apple employees raising concerns that misleading data was used to support new health products were dismissed or met with hostility, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-health-employees-backlash-misled-executives-2021-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a lack of structure within the health group, along with other organizational problems, is slowing and frustrating the company’s ambitions to push into healthcare, current and former Apple employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDZBVX"&gt;Some concerns focused on clinics Apple set up to both provide healthcare to employees and develop ways to integrate data collected from Apple devices into care. One doctor involved with the project, Will Poe, said in a resignation letter to CEO Tim Cook that he was concerned that members of the team were giving misleading and too-rosy information to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who oversees the company’s health effort, former employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. Poe was concerned that team members told&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Williams that the clinics provided “high-quality” care, even though the quality of care wasn’t being measured in a standardized way, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBlaTQ"&gt;Other employees raised similar concerns to Cook and Williams, &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported, but the company didn’t take any action. “The company does not want help. It is completely happy with the current status quo,” a former employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCUSpb"&gt;Apple claims that parts of the &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;story are based on “outdated” information. The company is still in the “early innings of our work in health technology,” Fred Sainz, a senior director of corporate communications for Apple, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Insider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJH1Uw"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536623/apple-primary-care-project-data-watch-app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from June&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;also outlined issues with the internal health clinics and said that employees were concerned about the way data was collected and presented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QItFMt"&gt;The Apple hardware team’s focus on creating apps and products for consumers, not for medicine, also complicated work by the health team to build a more robust primary care program through the internal clinics, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported. The company began to think of the clinics and their work as a way to drive Apple Watch sales, rather than as their own project, people familiar with the approach told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVL2DQ"&gt;Current and past employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; there is no clear strategy for the health team and that internal culture doesn’t allow for feedback. One doctor working with the clinic’s team had her direct reports removed after speaking up about the clinic’s care and pushing back on Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple and head of the project, in a meeting. A senior engineering program manager was fired soon after saying in a meeting that “some people in the organization preferred telling good stories over accurately representing the data,” former employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMbn0u"&gt;​“Any and all allegations of retaliatory behavior are investigated thoroughly and handled with appropriate corrective actions,” Sainz said in the statement to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “All health leaders encourage employees to always do what’s right, speak up and raise questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="925hYg"&gt;The revelations come as Apple’s overall culture is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest"&gt;starting to shift&lt;/a&gt;, with more employees speaking out about the workplace and pushing for executives to take concerns seriously. “The overarching desire...is that employees want to feel heard,” Zoe Schiffer wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikvpRO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple shares memorial to Steve Jobs on 10th anniversary of his death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ure96Cy3FMUwLBlRAbXTxZs4Eo=/0x32:3650x2465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955046/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_9.13.26_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUpJQu"&gt;Apple is commemorating its co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs’ death with &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;a new short film and a personal statement&lt;/a&gt; from the visionary tech executive’s family. Jobs passed away 10 years ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/6/2473035/apple-steve-jobs-has-died"&gt;on October 5th, 2011&lt;/a&gt;, after a difficult battle with pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9cigZ"&gt;The short film — which has currently taken over Apple’s landing page —  commemorates Jobs’ life in photos, videos, and some of his most iconic quotes, from “the computer is a bicycle for the mind” to the introductions of the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ubqnxz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“People with passion can change the world for the better.”— SJ. Hard to believe it’s been 10 years. Celebrating you today and always. &lt;a href="https://t.co/x2IUnlO7ta"&gt;pic.twitter.com/x2IUnlO7ta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1445358107157221379?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jCdSaA"&gt;Apple also published a statement from Jobs’ family, shared below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="leaHWN"&gt;For a decade now, mourning and healing have gone together. Our gratitude has become as great as our loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8fKy5"&gt;Each of us has found his or her own path to consolation, but we have come together in a beautiful place of love for Steve, and for what he taught us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTR5Gx"&gt;For all of Steve’s gifts, it was his power as a teacher that has endured. He taught us to be open to the beauty of the world, to be curious around new ideas, to see around the next corner, and most of all to stay humble in our own beginner’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xqm0xa"&gt;There are many things we still see through his eyes, but he also taught to look for ourselves. He gave us equipment for living, and it has served us well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vzh3pQ"&gt;One of our greatest sources of consolation has been our association of Steve with beauty. The sight of something beautiful — a wooded hillside, a well‑made object — recalls his spirit to us. Even in his years of suffering, he never lost his faith in the beauty of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yoI2b"&gt;Memory is inadequate for what is in our hearts: we miss him profoundly. We were blessed to have him as husband and father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ALJz1L"&gt;Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/the-steve-jobs-deal-with-dell-that-could-have-changed-apple-and-tech-history/?utm_source=reddit.com"&gt;spoke to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about his work with Jobs. “You can’t be following the rules and making amazing things happen. Steve was certainly exceptional in that regard,” Dell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPevOE"&gt;Tim Cook, Jobs’ successor as CEO, shared his thoughts with Apple employees via a companywide memo, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/read-tim-cook-s-staff-memo-on-10th-anniversary-of-jobs-s-death?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “[Steve] challenged us to see the world not for what it was, but for what it could be,” Cook writes. “I feel so lucky that we spend our days creating wildly innovative tools that connect people, inspire them to think differently, and empower them to make their own dent in the universe, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTFyfe"&gt;Jony Ive, Jobs’ close friend, collaborator, and Apple’s former chief design officer offered his memories of Jobs yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jony-ive-steve-jobs-memories-10th-anniversary-11633354769?mod=e2tw"&gt;in an editorial for &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;My understanding of him refuses to remain cozy or still,” Ive writes. “He truly believed that by making something useful, empowering and beautiful, we express our love for humanity ... I miss Steve desperately and I will always miss not talking with him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jqdt2"&gt;Apple’s memorial video is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;available to view on its site&lt;/a&gt;. For more information on Jobs and Apple’s outsized impact on the world at large, you should listen to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/land-of-the-giants-podcast"&gt;the current (fifth) season of &lt;em&gt;Land of the Giants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuZNzz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 5th, 2:03PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Tim Cook’s memo from &lt;/em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;em&gt;and tweet from Cook sharing Apple’s memorial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaNqWaV5j4cx0WB5BjSpqEwDxr4=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949627/Apple_watch_series7_availability_stainless_steel_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 features larger screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAQ6pp"&gt;Like clockwork, Apple announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; model at its September “California Streaming” event alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The Apple Watch Series 7 is the latest flagship and sits atop Apple’s current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios. After Apple’s initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;the new models are set to release on October 15th&lt;/a&gt;, and you can preorder them on &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt; beginning Friday, October 8th at 5AM PT / 8AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWzYHy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We will update this post as more retailers open up preorder listings, as well as Apple’s own direct links and finalized pricing for the full Series 7 range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LuD92a"&gt;What’s New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="roSEq8"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 prominently features that new, larger display that stretches the screen closer to the edges for a more full-bleed aesthetic and showing more actionable information at once. It has a slight curve at its farthest edges, though Apple says the watch is overall more durable thanks to a 50 percent thicker glass cover and IP6X rating for better dirt and sand resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RLkrZ"&gt;New watch faces exclusive to the Series 7 promise to put that extra screen real estate to work, while the watch maintains a physical footprint that is close to its predecessor. Apple has also improved charging speeds, including a new USB-C wireless magnetic fast charger with the watch that it claims will offer up to a 33 percent quicker charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lttaJ7"&gt;On the software side, the Apple Watch Series 7 runs watchOS 8, supports a full swiping keyboard for text input, is compatible with new workouts, and maintains all the health-tracking features found on prior iterations: sleep tracking, heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and fall detection that now registers during workouts. There is plenty to take advantage of if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch and prefer to have Apple’s latest and greatest iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LxippD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="TraF9d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0ZdgqF"&gt;The aluminum-encased Series 7 watches come in midnight, starlight, an updated blue, (PRODUCT) RED, and a new dark green colorway, so there is a bit to choose from whether you’re going for a discreet, bold, or rugged look. Let’s break down all that there is to offer here before we dive further into specific configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FWKvlA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10743503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ixNYqI"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yBbMqA"&gt;With the impending release of the Apple Watch Series 7, you will be able to preorder your preferred configuration direct from Apple starting October 8th at 5AM PT / 8AM ET. The main options for you to decide on, aside from your preferred color, are size and connectivity. The base Apple Watch Series 7 configuration is a 41mm, GPS-only model that retails for $399. If the Series 7 follows the same pricing convention as the Series 6, you should be able to outfit the 41mm version with a cellular connection for $100 more. If you have a larger wrist or prefer bigger screens, the 45mm GPS-only model will most likely run $429, while its cellular-equipped counterpart climbs up to $529. We will confirm these Series 7 prices and update as soon as Apple announces pricing beyond the starting $399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iin96H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uoprLg"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 from phone carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3dbtKG"&gt;Most major phone carriers in the USA will also offer the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 for preorder, which can help if you prefer to purchase the smartwatch on a monthly installment plan you might already have for your phone. We anticipate Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all offering the Series 7 in each of its colors at the same starting price as Apple for its cellular models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxgiN"&gt;Apple has confirmed that when you &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 through its own store&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-14498937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/applewatch/SID/https://www.att.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint / T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, you will get $100 back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g50QyqEKJq0rPdmM51JUYxdmD-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900357/Apple_watch_series7_availability_hermes_10052021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Edition with Hermès strap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VH7yJz"&gt;More premium case options and custom configurator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T46tsH"&gt;Apple has also offered the latest top-end watch in additional case materials for years. This generation is no different, with Apple confirming the Series 7 is to be sold in stainless steel and titanium finishes, as well as band options from luxury fashion boutique Hermès. The easiest way to preorder these is &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, as not all retailers sell the more luxurious watches, and most people opt for the aluminum models, which offer the same functionality at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR4t55"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fstudio%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s own online boutique for outfitting the exact custom configuration of Apple Watch a customer chooses, makes a return for the Series 7. If you prefer an Apple Watch in a particular combination of size, finish, color, and band, you can make your selection and pay the configured price directly from Apple. This is the only way to order one of the popular solo loop straps with your Apple Watch, as those fixed-length straps are only sold through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
