    <title>Twitter adds third-party signup with Apple or Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBK0aQJiIups6AXXZzr4olipHFQ=/0x1155:1125x1905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69668303/IMG_2175.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AujELN"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1422229834089082882"&gt;has introduced third-party login support&lt;/a&gt;, letting users create accounts and log in to the social network with their Apple or Google accounts (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/02/twitter-for-ios-officially-gains-support-for-sign-in-with-apple/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Currently, there doesn’t appear to be a way to link your Apple or Google account to an existing Twitter account, so third-party login is (at least for the moment) limited to accounts created using the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVWZLQ"&gt;The feature reportedly &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/19/twitter-beta-now-lets-you-log-in-with-your-google-account/"&gt;showed up in the Twitter beta last month&lt;/a&gt;, but now it appears to be more widely available. I was able to set up a Twitter account using my Apple account, and the process was like a more streamlined version of the regular signup process — there were no emails or passwords to deal with, and when signing in with Google, it even brought over the profile picture I use for my Google account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7FfeXa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sign on with ease and start scrolling your timeline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, when you log in or sign up to join the conversation on Twitter, you have the option to use:&lt;br&gt;▪️ Your Google Account on the app and on web&lt;br&gt;▪️ Or your Apple ID on iOS, and soon on web &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nf56H1ghmY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nf56H1ghmY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1422229834089082882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5ceRO"&gt;At the moment, the sign-in experience isn’t universal. Signing in with Google is possible on iOS, Android, and Web, but doing so with Apple is currently iOS-only (though web support is coming soon, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1422229834089082882"&gt;according to Twitter Support&lt;/a&gt;). The current version of the Twitter for Mac desktop app doesn’t seem to support either login method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dxj6a1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At the moment, the sign-in experience isn’t universal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fuCDld"&gt;On Android, signing into an account created with Apple doesn’t appear to be possible — the Continue with Apple button isn’t there, and using the traditional Twitter sign-on with my Apple ID password didn’t seem to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yjo2J5"&gt;What’s more, you don’t seem to be able to change your password after you’ve created your account with an Apple login, as the page asks for your current password. &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/create-twitter-account"&gt;A Twitter support page&lt;/a&gt; does mention the ability to disconnect your Apple or Google account, but it’s web-only, which Apple users can’t log into yet. (Google users can perform a password reset after disconnecting their accounts.) We’ve reached out to Twitter to clarify whether this process should work, if it’s done by other means, or if it’s currently not possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmWWGz"&gt;It’s likely no accident that Sign in with Google and Sign in with Apple are launching at the same time — Apple’s App Store guidelines &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple"&gt;require apps to include Apple as an option&lt;/a&gt; if the app allows any other third-party logins. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The shadow of the chip shortage is looming over tech’s big quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HV96fsmouPZtk6sNhXcn6z5ZC0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667632/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U3ad3o"&gt;Tech earnings this quarter were, to the surprise of no one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602434/earnings-apple-intel-nothing-earbuds-vergecast-podcast-460"&gt;high&lt;/a&gt;. But amid the record-settling revenues, the looming specter of the global semiconductor shortage was the fly in the ointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAnOmF"&gt;While virtually none of the major tech companies sounded too concerned on their calls, component shortages were called out by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596578/microsoft-q4-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22599306/samsung-q2-2021-earnings-component-shortage-foldables"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/07/27/amd-ceo-processor-shipments-will-grow-despite-chip-shortage-and-improve-more-in-2022/"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-warns-of-consumer-chip-shortages-for-q3"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; as potential problems for either their previous or upcoming quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="p9Ww2m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XeM2VH"&gt;Apple had already warned that part shortages could impact its iPad and Mac businesses at its Q2 earnings to the tune of $3 billion to $4 billion. CFO Luca Maestri &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-tesla-to-take-hit-from-chip-shortage-a-sign-of-problems-intensity-11627474416"&gt;said on last week’s Q3 earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that it was able to keep those losses mainly limited to iPads and under $3 billion, in what was definitely a win for Apple. But it came at the same time as a warning from CEO Tim Cook that supply constraints could impact the iPhone — the most important and lucrative part of Apple’s product lineup — in the coming quarter, which could be a far more concerning factor for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ioemva"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596578/microsoft-q4-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, too, called out a decline in Windows OEM revenue (a drop of 3 percent) as being directly caused by supply chain constraints, even as its cloud revenue continued to soar. And of course, while Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox Series X and Series S consoles continue to sell every unit Microsoft can make, there’s just simply not enough supply to go around yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AGu7VE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Earnings are up, but parts are still in short supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="64lF7e"&gt;It was a similar story at Samsung, which posted increased revenue and operating profit year over year, carried by massive demand from its semiconductor business (which accounts for over a third of its revenue and more than half its profit). But Samsung was also weighed down by less overall demand and revenue for its mobile phone business, which declined compared to last quarter due to a combination of supply shortages and the seasonal buying cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ig9ZtT"&gt;Other companies, like Tesla, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;have taken more drastic steps&lt;/a&gt; to face the shortage: the company had to develop new firmware for whatever chips it could get its hands on, but CEO Elon Musk was blunt about the fact that semiconductors would be a big concern for the company. “The global chip shortage situation remains quite serious,” he said, highlighting difficulties Tesla experienced getting chips that power essential parts of its cars — specifically the airbags and seatbelt modules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InprxV"&gt;And of course, the chipmakers themselves are calling out concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-intc-2q-earnings-report-2021-11626899296?mod=article_inline"&gt;Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger noted&lt;/a&gt; on an earnings call that the shortage could last through 2023 across the industry, noting that he expects that “it will take another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand.” The company also called out “persistent industry-wide component in substrate shortages” — meaning that Intel doesn’t expect to be able to get enough of the raw materials it needs to make chips — despite high demand for its processors. That may lead to “particularly acute” shortages for Intel’s consumer chips in the upcoming third quarter — which would be right when PC sales tend to kick up for back-to-school students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZxWS2G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hard-to-find gadgets will likely only grow harder to find&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lrjwvz"&gt;AMD CEO Lisa Su took a more optimistic note, explaining in &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amd-ceo-chip-shortage-things-135346104.html"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while supply may still be “tight” for the rest of 2021, things have been getting better throughout the year. “As we go through the end of this year and certainly into next year, I think things will improve,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEoatK"&gt;Taken as a whole, there are two trends to see here: the first is that big tech companies aren’t letting supply issues stand in the way of posting record revenues. But it’s also clear that the impact of the shortages is very much one that’s still in progress, and until capacity starts to increase or demand starts to die down, concerns over shortages, product delays, and hard-to-find gadgets will likely only grow as we head toward the busy holiday shopping season. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest IDC numbers reiterate Apple’s dominance of tablet market</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air has the same design and shape as the 11-inch iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hM3dNfax2EBfkBmyopTGAlbm7YM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69661644/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U4Zfn1"&gt;Earlier this week during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;Apple’s earnings&lt;/a&gt; call, CEO Tim Cook said that the iPad had experienced its most successful June quarter in nearly a decade. And now &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48120621"&gt;IDC is out with its latest worldwide shipment figures&lt;/a&gt; that underline Apple’s commanding lead over the tablet competition. After refreshing the iPad Air in 2020 and launching an upgraded iPad Pro earlier this year, Apple is next expected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;update the iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycfd5d"&gt;IDC estimates that Apple shipped 12.9 million iPads in the second quarter. Its nearest competition is Samsung, which hit 8 million shipments. Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;Galaxy Tab S7 tablets&lt;/a&gt; offer fantastic hardware and punchy OLED screens, but they remain hamstrung by Android’s less-than-stellar selection of tablet apps. Lenovo, which continues to release well-received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598860/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review"&gt;Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Chrome OS tablets&lt;/a&gt;, took third with 4.7M units shipped, and Amazon came in fourth with 4.3 million Fire tablet shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqYqGq"&gt;Both PC and tablet shipments have surged over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as people have adapted to working from home and remote education. IDC’s figures reveal that Chromebook shipments have grown 68.6 percent year over year and reached 12.3 million units shipped in the second quarter. “While this wasn’t a record quarter for Chromebooks, it wasn’t far off the prior two quarters, which shattered previous highs,” IDC wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67AyqS"&gt;But IDC does point to a possible slowdown in sales for Chromebooks and tablets due to ongoing chip shortages and an easing of consumer demand as more people return to the workplace or classroom. Apple has said that supply constraints could be detrimental to iPad sales in the coming months, and the iPhone might be affected as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mastodon now has an official iPhone app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UuqtDryL8A5gdJtWPwW5ae3Yd54=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658958/mastodon.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucykbC"&gt;Decentralized social network Mastodon now has an official iPhone app. The nonprofit behind Mastodon &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974"&gt;launched the app&lt;/a&gt; on iOS today, supplementing an existing web version and several &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps"&gt;third-party apps&lt;/a&gt; for iOS, Android, and other platforms. The app is free and offers a similar feature set to Mastodon’s core service, although it doesn’t include Mastodon’s broad local and federated timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtPWX7"&gt;Mastodon describes the app as particularly geared toward getting new users on board the nontraditional social platform. As we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15183128/mastodon-open-source-twitter-clone-how-to-use"&gt;outlined before&lt;/a&gt;, Mastodon looks similar to Twitter but is built around &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities"&gt;independently run communities&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href="https://activitypub.rocks/"&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; protocol) rather than a single central network. You can create your account on a community of your choice while following and messaging people in other communities as well. It’s an unusual design among modern social platforms, and offering an official iOS entry point could help ease people into it more smoothly. CEO Eugen Rochko confirmed plans for a comparable Android app, but there’s no timeline for releasing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDrL1W"&gt;Mastodon’s iOS app supports features like polls and sensitive content filters, and the app page subtly highlights its differences with bigger services like Twitter by mentioning Mastodon’s “ad-free, chronological timeline.” As mentioned above, however, you &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; find a section for local and federated timelines — Mastodon’s firehose of all public posts from your home community and the communities of people linked with it, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcDHdT"&gt;Rochko tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that those timelines were a “suboptimal” way to discover new content, and excluding them also reduced the potential for conflict with Apple, which has required some social networks to limit what users can find through their apps. (Reddit’s iOS app, for instance, makes you opt into NSFW content through the web.) For a different feature set, you can keep using one of the existing iOS apps — or just log in through the web.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk calls Apple’s App Store fees a ‘de facto global tax on the Internet’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saturday Night Live - Season 46" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8qmgti1mlml3NmF5TTdl1BeUAU=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657521/1232778207.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By: Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WC23UO"&gt;Elon Musk has had a busy Friday on Twitter. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602017/elon-musk-tim-cook-apple-ceo-demand-tesla-acquisition"&gt;flatly denying that he has ever spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt; in response to a wild story alleging he demanded to take over as the company’s CEO as part of an acquisition offer, Musk has now tweeted his support of Epic Games’ fight against Apple over App Store policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypPcEN"&gt;“Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. “Epic is right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tgM4kg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mmbDWB"&gt;Epic is currently embroiled in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;a legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that its App Store rules, which allow Apple to take a 30 percent commission on many transactions on the App Store, are unfair and anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiXz6b"&gt;Perhaps aiming to take advantage of the massive spotlight Musk is bringing to the fight by tweeting about it to his 58.7 million followers, CEO Tim Sweeney, who has been a vocal opponent of Apple on Twitter, posted his latest salvo against the iPhone maker just 25 minutes after Musk’s tweet. “In the future all physical goods will have a digital presence, and Apple will tax and gatekeep world commerce,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1421156142047170567"&gt;Sweeney said&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple must be stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nhEBpM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Apple Tax is far more pernicious than many realize. “It only applies to digital goods accessible on iOS”, they say — but in the future all physical goods will have a digital presence, and Apple will tax and gatekeep world commerce. Apple must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1421156142047170567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xS2O2V"&gt;Apple has not replied to a request for comment. Epic pointed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to Sweeney’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTt2vb"&gt;Epic faced off with Apple in court for much of the month of May, and while we’re still awaiting a verdict on the lawsuit, the trial itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;revealed all sorts of interesting information&lt;/a&gt;. Epic has also filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;an antitrust suit against Google&lt;/a&gt; over Play Store policies, though that case is moving more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnkh7y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th, 3:28PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that Epic pointed us to Sweeney’s tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk and Apple deny wild story that he tried to replace Tim Cook </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla CEO Elon Musk Testifies In SolarCity Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PB8X5BB1v1lSmOKT3NMpA6tkUZE=/0x0:5167x3445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657090/1233956452.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6GRyd"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly demanded to become Apple’s CEO in a 2016 phone call with current Apple CEO Tim Cook, according to an upcoming book about Tesla. The story, shared by &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-07-30/power-play-tesla-book-review"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Play-Tesla-Elon-Century-ebook/dp/B08MQ4KWWR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter Tim Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J05FIO"&gt;As the book tells it, Cook suggested to Musk that Apple acquire Tesla, and Musk said he wanted to be CEO. Cook reportedly agreed, but Musk clarified that he wanted to be the CEO of Apple. “According to a former aide who heard (Musk’s) retelling of the exchange,” Cook said “Fuck you” before hanging up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3B4B3"&gt;But Musk and Apple have both suggested that the conversation couldn’t have happened because Musk and Cook have never spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMiQC5"&gt;Musk, in a tweet on Friday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421150913075503112"&gt;flat out said that&lt;/a&gt; “Cook &amp;amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever.” He also said that he attempted to meet with Cook about Apple acquiring Tesla, a meeting that Cook refused. (Musk previously discussed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;this attempted meeting in December&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gpC1X4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Cook &amp;amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of today’s value.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421150913075503112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="saX9fM"&gt;When asked for comment about the reported conversation, Apple pointed to remarks Cook made during an interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; Kara Swisher where he denied having ever spoken to Elon. “You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon, although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;Cook said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXM0qp"&gt;Musk also claims that much of the book is false. “Higgins managed to make his book both false *and* boring,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421145405530771458"&gt;Musk said in a tweet on Friday&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QTfPhv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Higgins managed to make his book both false *and* boring   &lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421145405530771458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gG8JnF"&gt;And Musk apparently tried to dash cold water on the book while it was being written, telling Higgins that much of the book was “nonsense,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="InHm3k"&gt;Musk apparently did not participate in the creation of “Power Play.” In an author’s note at the end, Higgins writes that Musk “was given numerous opportunities to comment on the stories, facts, and characterizations presented in these pages. Without pointing to any specific inaccuracies, he offered simply this: ‘Most, but not all, of what you read in this book is nonsense.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Hpddym"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421156081041088512"&gt;Higgins says&lt;/a&gt; that Musk had “plenty of opportunities” to comment and that the story of the conversation with Cook “comes from Musk’s own account of the conversation, according to people who heard the retelling at the time.” In an earlier tweet, he also characterized the story of Musk and Cook’s conversation &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421138332814303233?s=21"&gt;as one that was&lt;/a&gt; “told inside Tesla as the company struggled with the Model X.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fbkLaC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Musk was given plenty of opportunities to comment on this. He didn’t. This anecdote comes from Musk’s own account of the conversation, according to people who heard the retelling at the time. &lt;a href="https://t.co/GRKZRBsaeR"&gt;https://t.co/GRKZRBsaeR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Higgins (@timkhiggins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421156081041088512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="T4Bjev"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As detailed in POWER PLAY, this is a story that was told inside Tesla as the company struggled with the Model X, according to people who heard it, and as some hoped for a white knight to save the day. Musk’s message was clear: Tesla’s fate was in their own hands. &lt;a href="https://t.co/4e0KJb3CD2"&gt;https://t.co/4e0KJb3CD2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Higgins (@timkhiggins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421138332814303233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="choHTi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421138447595675651?s=21"&gt;He also says that Apple&lt;/a&gt; “was given several opportunities to comment prior publication and declined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBMLtg"&gt;Higgins has not replied to a request for comment. A representative for the book’s publisher pointed to Higgins’ Twitter feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9HdbE"&gt;Shortly after tweeting that he has never met Cook, Musk tweeted in support of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;Epic’s fight against Apple and its rules on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746"&gt;Musk said&lt;/a&gt;. “Epic is right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6C7Y6P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th, 3:47PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added response from the book’s publisher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A three-pack of Google Nest Minis is only $64 at eBay right now</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Normally $50 a pop, BuyDig is offering a trio of Google Nest Minis for nearly 60 percent off. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mrCmsy"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, the Google Nest Mini is a miniature take on the larger smart speakers that came before it. The compact device doesn’t boast the same sound quality as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;, but it's impressive for its size, especially when mounted to a wall or placed in a smaller room. What’s more, it packs backlit volume buttons and many of the same features that have come to define the category, including the ability to answer voice queries, control your smart home, and play music, adding to its overall versatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvIwq9"&gt;If you’re already tapped into the Google ecosystem or are looking for an inexpensive way to strew audio throughout your home, BuyDig is currently offering a three-pack of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F334087468632%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals073021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F30%2F22600005%2Fgoogle-nest-mini-smart-speaker-apple-magsafe-charger-macbook-air-m1-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Minis on eBay for $64&lt;/a&gt;, significantly less than if you were to pay per Mini. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Je4zOF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10676145"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lJFfNl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; has officially arrived, however, if you’re looking for a cheaper means for charging your iPhone 12, 12 Pro, or an older device that supports Qi charging, there’s always Apple’s MagSafe Charger. The simple, wired accessory attaches magnetically to the latest iPhone 12 models and allows for 15-watt charging speeds when paired with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20-watt power brick&lt;/a&gt; (sold separately). And while far slower than a traditional USB-C cable — it takes about an hour to charge an iPhone 12 to 40 percent — it’s also more convenient, especially given that it can charge AirPods models with a wireless charging case and older Qi-compatible accessories. Normally $40, Apple’s MagSafe Charger is currently &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDeals072921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-magsafe-charger-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Woot for $30&lt;/a&gt;, matching its best-ever price.&lt;/p&gt;

If you still want to make the jump to Apple’s M1 chip, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747617164066258670#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently knocking $250 off&lt;/a&gt; the price of the 256GB model with 8GB of RAM, a new low for Apple’s 13-inch laptop. To take advantage of the deal before it expires on August 1st, you need to log in or sign up for a free My Best Buy account and enroll in the Student Deals program, a move that takes an additional $100 off the $850 sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wvXJY"&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with the latest MacBook Air, it’s currently one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. The 2020 model boasts excellent battery life, impressive performance, and a well-built design. Plus, it’s available in three colorways: gold, space gray, and silver. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why Apple says it hates leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kusRJHhZqdRuCNeerWCWmKayuBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655218/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SoXH7n"&gt;Apple is a notoriously secretive company, and a cease and desist letter recently &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzp9z/apple-says-leaks-cause-companies-to-make-iphone-cases-at-the-wrong-size"&gt;acquired by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sheds new light on &lt;em&gt;exactly &lt;/em&gt;why, arguing that leaks harm accessory makers, consumers, and Apple itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keC9kg"&gt;The C&amp;amp;D order reportedly sent to a Chinese citizen by Apple’s lawyers in China, says that leaks about Apple’s iPhone dimensions could mislead case manufacturers, who might make accessories that are incompatible with the final product. As Apple puts it, “third-party accessory manufacturers may develop and sell mobile phone cases and other accessories that are not actually compatible with the unreleased products.” &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; notes that the market for Apple accessories is estimated to be worth almost $20 billion worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VJMZXI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The secret of Apple’s latest technological innovation is an important part of the company DNA”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwwyrk"&gt;Apple also says that leaked info prevents the company from being able to surprise and delight consumers at launch events. “Apple has made every effort to take strict measures to maintain confidentiality for any information about Apple’s products before their official release to ensure that every time Apple releases a new product, it can surprise the public,” the letter reads. “The secret of Apple’s latest technological innovation is an important part of the company DNA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYSwLp"&gt;“Such situations harm the interests of consumers and Apple. Therefore, it is obvious that when the unpublished information about the design and performance of Apple’s products is kept confidential, it has actual and potential commercial value,” Apple’s letter reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqjRjQ"&gt;The letter was sent as part of what appears to be a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyv5bm/apple-tells-leaker-to-snitch-on-sources-or-it-will-report-them-to-the-police"&gt;crackdown on&lt;/a&gt; the sale of prototypes of unannounced Apple products on social media. These devices are allegedly stolen by factory employees and sold to anyone that could benefit, often resulting in information about the products being made public far in advance of their official announcements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZ2692"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyv5bm/apple-tells-leaker-to-snitch-on-sources-or-it-will-report-them-to-the-police"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the cease and desist letter it obtained was dated June 18th. It’s unclear how many individuals were sent similar letters, but it notes that the month coincides with the Twitter account of a seller, who went by the name “Mr. White,” disappearing from the platform. Also in June, a leaker known as “Kang” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22551182/kang-letter-apple-leak-warning-iphone-12"&gt;revealed on Weibo&lt;/a&gt; that they’d received a notice from the company, and indicated that they’d stop posting about upcoming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLzI8I"&gt;Beyond what Apple outlines in its letter, there are a host of reasons why companies are widely understood to not want their unannounced plans to be made public. The release of confidential product information might allow competitors to start to develop copycat devices ahead of time. And hearing that an upgraded device is on the way could make people less likely to buy an existing model, per the so-called “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect"&gt;Osborne effect&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrBopN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sgt. Pepper’s to get new Atmos mix because current version ‘doesn’t sound quite right’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MEXICO-PHOTOGRAPHY-BEATLES-SGT PEPPER-EXHIBITION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TmA515p05T7O6mIochM09HBPttA=/0x16:3242x2177/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69654962/847150650.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPHUBG"&gt;The Beatles seminal &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band&lt;/em&gt; is set to receive another Dolby Atmos mix, after producer Giles Martin, son of the album’s original producer George Martin, admitted that the current version “doesn’t sound quite right.” The current mix, produced by the younger Martin in 2017, was made with Dolby Atmos theaters in mind, rather than personal listening via services like Apple Music. “I’m gonna replace it,” the said the two time Grammy winner &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/beatles-best-spatial-audio-albums-apple-music-abbey-road-giles-martin-1202832/"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “It’s good. But it’s not right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIHwMA"&gt;The current Atmos mix of the album was created to &lt;a href="https://professional.dolby.com/sgt-peppers/"&gt;coincide with its 50th anniversary in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, it was designed to be played in Dolby Atmos cinemas at a series of live listening events. But now that it is available via streaming services like &lt;a href="https://news.dolby.com/en-WW/184454-sgt-pepper-s-lonely-hearts-club-band-the-immersive-experience-launches-in-liverpool-photo-image-apple-corps-ltd#:~:text=all%20tickets%20for%20the%20free%20event%20are%20now%20fully%20sold%20out.%20however%2C%20fans%20around%20the%20world%20can%20immerse%20themselves%20within%20these%20recordings%2C%20which%20are%20available%20to%20stream%20in%20dolby%20atmos%20via%20amazon%20echo%20studio%20and%20amazon%20music%20hd%20for%20the%20first%20time%2C%20with%20further%20services%20to%20follow%20in%202020."&gt;Amazon Music HD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;more recently Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, people are listening to it in smaller rooms or with headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0sly17"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sgt. Pepper’s is a theatrical mix that’s then being converted into a smaller medium”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VEQYdq"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt; was, I think, the first album ever mixed in Dolby Atmos. And we did that as a theatrical presentation,” Martin explains. “So &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt; is a theatrical mix that’s then being converted into a smaller medium. Therefore, it’s not quite right. I’m gonna go back to the theatrical mix and make it into what’s called near-field Dolby Atmos, as opposed to the cinema Dolby Atmos. It’s a bit bright. It’s a bit digital. But again, I’m gonna replace it, so that’s cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdyRx7"&gt;According to Martin, the spatial mix of &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt; “seems to lack a bit of bass and a little bit of weight behind it.” In comparison, the Atmos mix of &lt;em&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/em&gt;, which was produced for &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; 50th anniversary in 2019 is “a much better-functioning Atmos mix because it’s much closer to the stereo mix, sonically.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6bCB8"&gt;What’s particularly fascinating about &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt;, is that the album was released at a time when mono recordings were the primary focus for most producers, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/05/23/528678711/why-remix-sgt-peppers-giles-martin-the-man-behind-the-project-explains"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;George Martin reportedly spent three weeks mixing the original mono version of the album, before spending just three days on the stereo release. The album has effectively lasted through three eras of music: first mono, then stereo, and now spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AII87B"&gt;With spatial audio in its infancy, there are plenty of examples out there of well known albums that don’t sound quite right in the new format. My colleague Chris Welch outlines a few of these in his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;review of Apple Music’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, where songs like “Buddy Holly” by Weezer and “What’s My Age Again?” by Blink 182 suffer from problems like muffled vocals and lifeless guitars. But hopefully these are just growing pains associated with a relatively new format, and we’ll one day look back on these tracks like we look back on early stereo recordings from the 60s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjNsz1"&gt;Giles Martin’s &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/beatles-best-spatial-audio-albums-apple-music-abbey-road-giles-martin-1202832/"&gt;full interview with &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is well worth a read for the producer’s insights on the potential for spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GarageBand can now help you remix tracks from Lady Gaga and Dua Lipa</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIVKZEteEhIaDqboikgwu4SwBNM=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652208/apple_garageband_update_jul21_hero_07292021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDUWki"&gt;If a year inside convinced you to shoot your shot at becoming an international DJ, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/07/garageband-features-new-sound-packs-from-dua-lipa-lady-gaga-and-top-producers/"&gt;Apple is updating GarageBand for iOS and iPadOS on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; with a low-stakes way to start dabbling in the world of remixes. GarageBand’s Remix Sessions lets you try your hand at remixing tracks from Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga with short video tutorials available to watch while you mess with loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11Yslx"&gt;You can access the new Remix Sessions from the Sound Library section of GarageBand. There’s currently only one song for each artist, “Break My Heart” for Dua Lipa and “Free Woman” for Lady Gaga, but the amount of samples and loops each song comes with is surprisingly broad. If you’ve played with GarageBand’s Live Loops before, the experience should be self-explanatory. Apple’s implementation of its video tutorial is a bit clunky — the downloaded artist’s Live Loops project will show up in your GarageBand, but to watch while you edit your song, you have to start the video in the Sound Library page and pop it into picture-in-picture mode manually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QyeX-lAvjsQQLIegK_7GcCrLucQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748868/apple_garageband_update_jul21_remix_lady_gaga_07292021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can watch video tutorials with tips from Lady Gaga or Dua Lipa while you remix their songs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L1sBBm"&gt;Apple is also releasing “hundreds of royalty-free loops, beats, instruments, drum kits, synth patches, and samples” in downloadable Producer Packs that, like the Remix Sessions, include video content that Apple says offers insight into the producers’ creative process. If a companion Mark Ronson Live Loops project that ties in to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/06/apple-tv-unveils-trailer-for-new-docuseries-watch-the-sound-with-mark-ronson/"&gt;an upcoming Apple TV Plus show&lt;/a&gt; is of interest to you, that’s available, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqNt3S"&gt;Interestingly, these new GarageBand perks are currently only available on iOS and iPadOS: users of the original macOS desktop version will have to go without Lady Gaga’s encouragement. The macOS version of GarageBand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17490656/apple-garageband-new-update-1000-new-loops-artist-lessons-free"&gt;does include “Artist Lessons” for free&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ph24954?locale=en_US"&gt;more hands-on educational videos&lt;/a&gt; for specific instruments like guitar or piano, so there’s at least something for you there if you’re trying to start your music journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zYqGD"&gt;GarageBand’s Remix Sessions and Producer Packs are available to download now.&lt;/p&gt;
