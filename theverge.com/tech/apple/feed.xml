    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="txvrRb"&gt;Apple has just finished its October 2021 event, which was full of news and announcements from the company — including the long-awaited M1-equipped MacBook Pros. There was a whole lot of news, so if you want to get caught up on the biggest updates from the show, you can catch up with our roundup right here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBf07U1f3SfXY1GBn0qf4vnlNZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936637/1Rm4aV2YiD.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oDUSLU"&gt;Apple announced two MacBook Pros with an all-new design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6PJZD2"&gt;Apple revealed a brand-new set of MacBook Pros, available in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; models. The Touch Bar is gone, replaced with a full-size function row. Many ports are back; there’s an HDMI port, three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card slot, a headphone jack, and the return of the MagSafe charger. The 14-inch model starts at $1,999, while the 16-inch model starts at $2,499. They will be available to preorder Monday ahead of availability next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8EtEO"&gt;And you might notice one thing at the top of the new laptops...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BXCdp6RCX3z2eHAgNLW-3ti8wZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936649/lcimg_dbbf28e3_568c_48d1_8c66_10.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at that notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sGfu6w"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;The new MacBook Pros have a notch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gWfZo4"&gt;Apple has brought over the notch design from the iPhone to the new MacBook Pros, though it houses an improved 1080p FaceTime camera. Let the notch debates begin anew. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hdiAgQBGm6b_1K9yaa7xFTV9BdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936571/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_10.16.29_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple announced the M1 Pro chip on Monday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TInW4E"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apples-m1-pro-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;Apple introduces two new custom chips: the M1 Pro and the M1 Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MipQsG"&gt;Apple announced its next two custom chips, dubbed the M1 Pro and M1 Max. They seem like they’ll be beefy chips, as Apple says the Pro has more than 33 billion transistors, while the Max has 57 billion transistors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HqOev_42l88bd058rnxYl2c8O0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936672/lcimg_c10580c7_99e5_4c68_aa75_9ad82322596e.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p id="KnVovk"&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros use the company’s adaptive refresh rate technology, ProMotion, topping out at up to 120Hz refresh rates. They’re also lit by Mini LEDs, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AGk2HI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;MagSafe has returned to the new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="D1H6yk"&gt;Apple’s beloved MagSafe magnetic charger is back with the new MacBook Pros. Apple is calling it MagSafe 3. The company says the new computers can charge up to 50 percent in 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HKCg1OBx1T-M1e7Xd8zlVn1F94g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936558/lcimg_7a256b51_4297_4b70_a2f6_c52dcd574ef5.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p id="bMB5j7"&gt;Apple launched a new version of its popular AirPods headphones. They look a lot like the AirPods Pro, but they don’t have interchangeable tips. The new headphones support spatial audio and are sweat- and water-resistant. You can preorder them Monday for $179, and they will be available next week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="odGqjI"&gt;Apple is introducing new colors to the HomePod Mini — the smart speaker will now also be available in yellow, orange, and blue. They’ll retail for the same $99 price starting in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uAXUZB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;Apple introduces a new $4.99 per month Apple Music Voice Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Vq49Yq"&gt;Apple launched a new Apple Music Voice Plan, which lets you access Apple Music with Siri. It will cost $4.99 per month and will be available later this fall in 17 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey is officially launching on October 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/orse-py0bHdXG97r9KiIu70nQRs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012089/akrales_20210515_4583_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LjQqvB"&gt;Following several beta releases, Apple announced that the next version of its macOS software, macOS Monterey, is about to release. It’ll be rolling out as an update starting on Monday, October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Dr8m8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin previewed the public beta software&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, highlighting Monterey’s improvements to Facetime. The software will bring other exciting features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;SharePlay and Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, which will enable Mac and iPad users to move files seamlessly between devices, but perhaps not at launch. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/"&gt;In its press release for the new, redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, Apple says that those features are coming “later this fall.” Additionally, Apple made significant tweaks to Safari, its own web browser, for Monterey, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;it has since toned down some of the changes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 MacBook Pros are the first with mini LED 120Hz refresh displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MqkmUqKiGp2FPD73T754i2UGx4=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012080/lcimg_81296345_e747_40c4_9960_c33954de9718.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nv7fDm"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;has just announced&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, powered by its newly revealed M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, and featuring a huge jump in display technology for the company’s laptops, with Mini LED displays that support Apple’s 120Hz ProMotion technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncpost-list-post-content-2857077"&gt;The larger 16-inch MacBook Pro has a 16.2-inch display with a 3456 x 2234 resolution, while the 14-inch model has a 14.2-inch panel at 3024 x 1964. Both sizes feature the same Mini LED technology that Apple debuted on the iPad Pro earlier this year, which offers local dimming on a level beyond traditional LED displays (although it’s still not quite on the level of OLED panels used by competitors like Samsung.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncpost-list-post-content-2857105"&gt;The new displays also feature Apple’s 120Hz “ProMotion” technology, which allows for faster refresh rates. Apple says that the computers will automatically adjust the refresh rate based on what you’re doing (for example, dropping the refresh rate when your screen is static). It’ll also offer the option for users to set locked in refresh rates, which is important for video editing or other use cases that rely on specific screen settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWbfsB"&gt;The new Mini LED screens are brighter, too, offering 1000 nits of sustained brightness with 1600 peak brightness and a 1 million to 1 contrast ratio, and the same Liquid Retina XDR that Apple uses for its Pro Display XDR monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dZtBLSYqGtW50E00yitrJXFp4o4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936684/lcimg_c10580c7_99e5_4c68_aa75_9ad82322596e.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQrEvE"&gt;The new displays also offer thinner bezels, although that comes at a cost: a iPhone-style &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;notch for the main camera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple brings MagSafe 3 to the new MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MagSafe 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/quhFD0CSgsFo_Ch2_eDdUTNI_-4=/25x0:1936x1274/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012127/Apple_MacBook_Pro_MagSafe_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MagSafe 3 | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="52peMg"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;ditched MagSafe five years ago&lt;/a&gt; when it moved to USB-C charging on its new laptops, but MagSafe 3 brings the familiar quick-release connector back to this latest lineup of MacBook Pro laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk4qTX"&gt;Other than their M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; computers ditch the much-hated Touch Bar in favor of physical keys and bring back the additional ports (HDMI, SD card slot) power users love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2Nebi"&gt;But for the clumsy people with cable-strewn desks, the return of MagSafe — what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;we’ve seen on iPhones&lt;/a&gt; just isn’t the same — might be the most important feature. According to Apple, the new MacBook Pros can still charge via USB-C Thunderbolt, but the updated MagSafe 3 plug delivers more power than before. Without providing detailed specs, Apple says that with fast charging, the MacBook Pro can charge up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2IP0P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces 16-inch MacBook Pro with new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3n76A8lOcCeTxI7UKOuQ0M1CsQ=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012026/lcimg_982af7b3_d14a_4a82_8073_a94b6e73fdd5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2xXc9"&gt;Apple has introduced its new 16-inch MacBook Pro, promising an upgrade in both design and performance. It’s configurable with the M1 Pro and the M1 Max, Apple’s new 10-core processors with eight “high-performance” cores and two “high-efficiency” cores. Models will be available in silver and space gray next week, with a starting price of $2,499&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyW7Ra"&gt;The chassis has also received a modern redesign. The device is 4.7 pounds and 16.8 mm thick, with a 16.2-inch display. The Touch Bar has been replaced by physical keys, and there’s an HDMI port on the right side in addition to a Thunderbolt 4 port and an SD slot, in addition to a headphone jack and two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left. It’s the most connectivity we’ve ever seen from a Mac notebook, according to Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhRU2Y"&gt;The first MacBook Pro 16 debuted in November 2019. It had a very similar design to previous 15-inch MacBook Pros and was powered by Intel’s 9th-Gen processors (which are now two generations old). Reviewers praised its outstanding keyboard and audio, in addition to its power, but moaned about the limited connectivity — there were only two Thunderbolt ports on each side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PJKn7"&gt;There’s a new 1080p camera, which Apple says delivers twice the low-light performance of previous MacBook shooters. A new six-speaker sound system supports Spatial Audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlngy4"&gt;The M1 Pro and M1 Max have big shoes to fill. The M1 chip that Apple announced last November (which now powers the MacBook Air, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Mac Mini, the iPad Pro, and the 2021 iMac) has blown competing offerings out of the water when it comes to processing power, efficiency, and integrated graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHtxSE"&gt;But customers have been waiting for Apple to release processor workstation machines, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro and a potential successor to the 27-inch iMac. It’s safe to say that many people are eagerly awaiting this MacBook Pro — not just to purchase for themselves but to see whether the M1 Max will take the laptop market by storm in the same way its predecessor did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyaonQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Pro event live blog &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new MacBook Pro has a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3CMwp32ZFRWfA8RZUAGz44A4bc=/25x0:1936x1274/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012024/Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_inch_Photoshop_10182021.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is bringing the notch to its pro laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="koVG91"&gt;Apple is adding a notch on the display of its new MacBook Pro models. It’s a cut-out that will house the camera system, much like how Apple moved to a notch design for its iPhone X launch in 2017. The surprising addition of the notch comes in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;new 14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch models&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are equipped with updated Apple M1 silicon inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPNtvK"&gt;Both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are completely redesigned, and the bezels have been trimmed down thanks to this notch. The bezels at the side are 3.5mm — that’s 24 percent thinner than before — and up top, it’s 60 percent thinner. The macOS menu bar now wraps around the camera, and it seems to look a lot better with dark mode enabled so the notch isn’t as noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VclukdteJZcAKm5pKIUsCkFv9Co=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936661/lcimg_7b103112_618c_43ac_9065_3dc630fdc9f6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The webcam inside the MacBook Pro’s notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q8nZA4"&gt;The camera inside this notch is now improved, too. It’s 1080p with a wider aperture and a larger image sensor that should provide better low-light performance. Apple is using computational video on this webcam, including noise reduction, machine learning-based face detection, local tone mapping, auto white balance, auto exposure, and smart HDR features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObG3rp"&gt;Yet despite all these improvements, it’s still just a regular webcam and Apple hasn’t added Face ID here. Apple justified its move to a notch on the iPhone X with the introduction of Face ID, but the notch here appears to be more about shrinking display bezels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULZIM9"&gt;The 14-inch is also 120Hz with HDR support, so you do get a big jump in fluidity for the notch. Apple is also adding an SD card slot, HDMI port, and more hardware improvements. You can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;more about the new 14-inch MacBook Pro here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new 14-inch MacBook Pro with a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8Gu1yCl8X5f8qVymayXFLwwadY=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012007/1Rm4aV2YiD.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzYFl7"&gt;Apple has announced a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which now includes a 14-inch screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;Apple’s new M1 Pro and Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;a notch&lt;/a&gt;, and a wider selection of ports in addition to the standard Thunderbolt ones — it brings back the HDMI port and SD card reader and adds a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;MagSafe 3 connector&lt;/a&gt; for charging (though you can also charge it with the Thunderbolt ports if your house is littered with USB-C power bricks). It starts at $1,999 and &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/2r5oMg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can be ordered “today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDMM04"&gt;It has a 14.2” 120Hz ProMotion MiniLED display, which Apple is branding as “Liquid Retina Pro XDR.” It has slimmer bezels than the previous generation but also includes a notch, which houses a 1080p webcam but not Apple’s FaceID system. Resolution-wise, the 14-inch model runs at 3024 by 1964, and it can run at 1000 nits sustained brightness and 1600 nits peak brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Us2bE3UcOL_fZMs34b7JaofcLbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936646/lcimg_dbbf28e3_568c_48d1_8c66_10c4149e89fe.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jWI2Zn"&gt;You can configure the 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s new M1 Pro or M1 Max chips. Both feature 10 CPU cores — the Pro can have a 14- or 16-core GPU, while the Max has 24- and 32-core GPU options. The new MacBook Pro comes with 16GB of RAM standard, and you can upgrade to 32GB with the M1 Pro, or 64 GB with the M1 Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAsG6B"&gt;In addition to all the new (well, returning) ports, the 14-inch MacBook Pro ads a third Thunderbolt port compared to its 13-inch counterpart. The Thunderbolt ports are now Thunderbolt 4, an upgrade from the Thunderbolt 3 ports on the previous models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMzX0"&gt;The redesign is the first major one in Apple’s pro laptop lineup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;since 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the year that brought ill-fated butterfly keyboards, the Touch Bar, and Thunderbolt 3 as the standard and only port type (with the exception of a headphone jack, of course). It also marks the return of the mid-size 14-inch screen, which Apple hasn’t put on a laptop since the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook#iBook_G4_(%22Snow%22)"&gt;2005 iBook G4&lt;/a&gt;.  Mainly, though, this laptop seems to be an about-face from Apple — the 2016 redesign ditched the ports, and now they’re back. Apple also added the Touch Bar in 2016, and that’s also been replaced by a set of function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beNUXV"&gt;It’s nice to see Apple more clearly differentiating the smaller MacBook Pros. The lineup has been a bit confusing for the past few years — the two-port MacBook Pro and four-port 13-inch computers were awkwardly lumped together but were pretty different computers with different processors and prices. Now, the screen size difference makes the distinction clear: people looking for portability can get the Air or 13-inch Pro, and the 14-inch Pro exists for those looking for more horsepower.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod Mini gets three new color options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j-UNdDcp-UybRFWpka5uG0XEIwY=/235x0:2766x1687/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011946/Apple_HomePod_mini_hero_5up_10182021.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini ... now in color&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0FT5Ir"&gt;With Siri now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22720890/siri-voice-control-ecobee-smart-thermostats"&gt;socializing on other smart speakers&lt;/a&gt;, Apple took to the stage at its October event to announce a new look for its HomePod Mini smart speaker. In addition to white and black (space gray), you will soon be able to pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod Mini&lt;/a&gt; in yellow, orange, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dctHY3"&gt;Apple is catching up with the competition here. Google’s Nest Mini smart speakers have blue and orange options, and there’s also a blue Amazon’s Echo Dot, plus some fun animal-themed colors offered on the Echo Dot Kids edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ql281U"&gt;The new speakers will have color-matched details throughout, including the tinted touch surface, the fabric mesh, volume icons, and that (non-removable) power cable. They will cost the same as the original Minis, $99, and will &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/kjMyZn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;be available in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HomePod Minis will work with the new Apple Music Voice streaming service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CNJ104"&gt;The Mini will work with the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;Apple Music Voice&lt;/a&gt; subscription, which Apple also announced at the event. This is a cheaper tier of Apple’s music streaming service that you access just using your voice, it arrives later this year for $4.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors take its in-house Arm-based chips to new heights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7BlgsBIEdxifeQl6sj7oGLgHlM=/127x0:1288x774/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011926/Untitled.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lzy4HC"&gt;Apple has officially announced its most powerful chips ever: the M1 Pro and M1 Max, souped-up versions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558095/apple-silicon-m1-chip-arm-macs-soc-charge-power-efficiency-mobile-processor"&gt;the M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; that it debuted last fall and the heart of its new MacBook Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MyN0q"&gt;The original M1 chip was announced a little less than a year ago as Apple’s first in-house, Arm-based chip for laptops. At launch, it was featured in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s revamped MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;the entry-level Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;2021 iMac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad Pro refreshes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MulTxQ"&gt;But as good as the M1 chip was, it was only a solution for replacing Intel on Apple’s entry-to-mid level hardware, with its high-end MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini models (meant for developers, programmers, graphic designers, and other more demanding workloads) all notably still sticking with Intel’s chips for the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2gnb7E3RgMZiuUET43W0Lk7P2Zw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936632/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_1.16.30_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLnsCOhvR8rB2XTIDFmtkhLpl-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936602/lcimg_2d0f1c7f_4824_4e90_b501_7d917bcd4ae2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o8R39h"&gt;The M1 Pro and M1 Max are Apple’s long-awaited answer to that issue: while both are built on the same 5nm process, Apple is promising big jumps in performance here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REgwYE"&gt;For the M1 Pro, Apple promises 70 percent better CPU performance and twice the graphics performance compared to the M1. While the basic architecture is still the same on the M1 Pro, Apple is upping the hardware here in a big way, with a 10-core CPU that offers eight performance cores and two efficiency cores, along with a 16-core GPU with 2,048 execution units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFZK7y"&gt;The new chip also supports more RAM, with configuration options up to 32GB (although, like the M1, memory is still integrated directly into the chip itself, instead of user-upgradable) with 200GB/s memory bandwidth. In total, the M1 Pro has 33.7 billion transistors, roughly twice the number of transistors that the M1 has. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fiLZU7uzSdtjK0cNs59lV7tp9Dk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936603/lcimg_c4568d1b_5f1a_468a_9292_9743a7eadbd3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dl3qmc"&gt;But Apple isn’t stopping there: it also announced the even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;powerful M1 Max, which has the same 10-core CPU configuration, with eight performance cores and two efficiency cores. But the M1 Max doubles the memory bandwidth (to 400GB/s), RAM (up to 64GB of memory) and GPU (with 32 cores, 4,096 execution units and four times the GPU performance of the original M1). The M1 Max features 57 billion transistors, making it the largest chip that Apple has made yet. The new chip also means that you can connect up to four external displays to a single device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJR8Wb"&gt;For comparison, the original M1 offered a classic Arm mix of eight CPU cores: four performance cores for more demanding tasks and four high-efficiency cores for extending battery life. The M1 also offered either a seven-core or eight-core GPU, depending on the computer model, and only allowed either 8GB or 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7ZgZN"&gt;Apple also promised that the new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips offer up to 1.7 times better CPU performance per watt compared to both the regular M1 and unspecified four-core and eight-core PC laptop chips — although the company didn’t give hard numbers or identify what other chips it was comparing things to, making it difficult to ascertain just how the new chips will hold up in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6VF9S7nURce1VWHrkb-6vohvu4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936647/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_1.21.36_PM.png"&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s new voice-only plan costs $4.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UtaG2Kgj_x2SxUy84d3Epf9FIWA=/146x0:1636x993/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011911/25cFLr6.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Music Voice Plan lets you access music through Siri.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g3viTf"&gt;Apple unveiled a new Voice plan for Apple Music during its Unleashed event on Monday that will be $4.99 per month. You can use only your voice and its Siri voice assistant to access all Apple Music content across Apple devices. It will be available later this fall in 17 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="du7pLy"&gt;“Apple Music and Siri are natural partners and already work seamlessly together,” Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-introduces-the-apple-music-voice-plan/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. And non-subscribers can sign up for a free, seven-day trial without auto-renewal to check out Voice before they commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKcI0d"&gt;Users can subscribe to the plan with Siri by saying, “Hey Siri, start my Apple Music Voice trial,” or by signing up through the Apple Music app. Once subscribed, users can request music to be played across all of their Siri-enabled devices, including HomePod mini, AirPods, iPhone, and when using CarPlay. Voice plan subscribers will have access to hundreds of new stations and playlists and full playback controls, including unlimited song skipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eE9bgi"&gt;The plan seems in response to Amazon Music’s Echo plan that’s priced at $3.99/month, which lets you use its Alexa voice assistant to request music via an Echo or Fire TV device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxGn7V"&gt;Voice plan subscribers will get customized in-app experiences with suggestions based on their preferences and recently played music. There will be a dedicated section called “Just Ask Siri” with tips for how to optimize Siri for Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
