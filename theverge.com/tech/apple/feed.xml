    <title>Here are our favorite MagSafe-compatible cases for the iPhone 13 </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xPF2ZE"&gt;Now that your brand-spanking-new iPhone 13 has arrived (or is on the way), it’s time to start thinking about protecting your baby. After all, it’s only a matter of time before your phone falls out of your pocket or makes contact with your keys, so it’s worth the extra investment now to prevent future damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CujTbM"&gt;Although MagSafe as an iPhone accessory standard is already a year old, Apple is off to a slow start building out its accessory ecosystem. Since its October 2020 launch event, Apple has only launched a dozen official MagSafe products: from the iconic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; puck to the 2021 &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMM0Q3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-golden-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Leather Wallet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KebrqK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPhone 13 Mini still gets slower MagSafe charging speeds ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"},{"title":"The Lightning port isn’t about convenience; it’s about control ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22690338/apple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe"},{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3z5diJ"&gt;Of course, third-party accessory makers are eager to make MagSafe products, too. Unfortunately, Apple is famously tight-fisted with its proprietary technology, even though its &lt;a href="https://mfi.apple.com/"&gt;MFi program&lt;/a&gt; is designed to license and control these very products. So third-party accessories like battery packs and chargers can only attach to the official MagSafe products and charge at 7.5W, rather than the 15W wireless charging standard that Apple-approved accessories can achieve. But third-party accessories tend to be cheaper in price and offer more selection than the official lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34HE13"&gt;In case you’re on the hunt for cases that will work with your official &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;, here are the top 10 third-party iPhone 13 cases that caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Backbone offers 3D-printed solution for iPhone 13 Pro camera bump issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pTzJYYDGcJV2im_LTmgwbvwrlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913581/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hk174V"&gt;Backbone Labs has acknowledged the issue that hampers the use of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;excellent iPhone gaming controller&lt;/a&gt; with the new iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691301/iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-backbone-one-gaming-controller-accessory"&gt;As we noticed last week&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone 13 Pro’s thicker camera bump means the phone doesn’t sit neatly in the Backbone One controller, either sticking out on one side or causing the bridge on the back to slightly buckle. It’s not unusable, but it’s not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV1mXY"&gt;“We spent a tremendous amount of time meticulously crafting every surface of Backbone One (both bits and atoms) and even designing universal support for the iPhones available when it was released,” a Backbone representative wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Backbone/comments/pvhl98/backbone_one_iphone_13_pro_pro_max_adapter/"&gt;official post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we’re disappointed in the situation at hand. Several folks on the team even upgraded to 13 Pro Max for a better gaming experience, and while the fit may be acceptable for some users, it’s not as good as we’d like it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WquSRF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0nAvVr"&gt;To address this, Backbone has designed an adapter that is intended to improve the experience with the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. Unfortunately, the company says it isn’t able to mass-produce them right away because of supply constraints and COVID-19, so the adapter design will be released as an open-source 3D printable file. If you don’t have access to a 3D printer, Backbone says “we’ll do our best” to send an adapter to users who contact the company’s support team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwUaUy"&gt;The printable files should be posted online “in a matter of days;” we’ll let you know how well the solution works when we can.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Tragedy of Macbeth, Invasion, Spencer, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H2Lj3hmq4oj5SpdBYQx4U0LHCcY=/25x0:1417x928/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69911945/denzel.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Denzel Washington stars in The Tragedy of Macbeth | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZcLLAx30Pw&amp;amp;ab_channel=AppleTV" target="_blank"&gt;Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vzZ8dn"&gt;We’re nearing the season finale of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; (only two more new episodes!), and it seems like the show’s got a lot of story threads that need to be knitted together after episode 10. Titled &lt;em&gt;No Weddings and a Funeral&lt;/em&gt;, episode 10 was solid, but I didn’t quite love it.  I’m trying to write about the episode without spoiling it, let’s just say I didn’t love how the session between Ted and Sharon which we’ve been waiting for all season was edited together with Rebecca’s retelling of a traumatic event with her own father. Jason Sudeikis and Hannah Waddingham were both so great, but editing the scenes together kind of killed the dramatic momentum. But! New plot twists suggest a cliffhanger of a season finale is coming in two weeks’ time. I’m ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5khZie"&gt;Here are the new trailers for this week: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SNa6hf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HM3hsVrBMA4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YW9aRk"&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVK24F"&gt;This black-and-white adaptation of Shakespeare’s Scottish play stars Denzel Washington as Macbeth, Frances McDormand as Lady Macbeth, and is directed by Joel Coen. It looks stunning (this trailer is simply far too short) and it’s fascinating (to me, anyway) that it stars two actors much older than the usual casting we see for &lt;em&gt;Macbeth&lt;/em&gt;’s lead roles. I don’t generally have an opinion on whether it’s “better” to watch a movie at home versus in a theater (which I know is a touchy subject these days), but it seems like an undertaking of this magnitude should be viewed on the biggest screen possible. &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth &lt;/em&gt;comes to theaters December 25th and to Apple TV Plus January 14th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z2e6Be"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hgsUzL75Yjk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Z8r8mF"&gt;Stranger Things 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KgwgbS"&gt;The latest teaser from the show’s fourth season shows a family we don’t yet know in what appears to be a very haunted house sometime in the 1950s. We also get a glimpse of the &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; kids (it’s been a long time, are they still kids?) breaking in to the apparently abandoned house many years later. What happened at this house, what’s up with that clock, and what does it have to do with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB2GYwbIAlM&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings"&gt;Hopper in Russia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILwLN6hV-X8&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings"&gt;Eleven&lt;/a&gt; listening? We will have to wait until 2022, because that’s all Netflix is giving us at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAc3SN"&gt;There were a slew of new teasers, trailers, and clips for other Netflix shows and movies unveiled Saturday during its Tudum event, including the star-studded &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op_v2PHDn-0&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  the &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; spin-off/prequel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ith2WetKXlg&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a few trailers for season 2 of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691354/witcher-season-2-blood-origin-trailer-teaser-watch-premiere-date-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, season 4 of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2FG-KIgX2o&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ozark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (finally!), season 2 of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkgSGrdL4SE&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (it was inevitable) and season 2 of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX7j0TjkxPE&amp;amp;t=3s&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Check out the rest of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/25/22691543/netflix-tudum-trailers-news-witcher-sandman-cowboy-bebop-bridgerton"&gt;Netflix trailers in this excellent roundup&lt;/a&gt; by Jay Peters and Andrew Webster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptqd4J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZaeA9x"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlaHxL3mHAU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4JUMEP"&gt;Invasion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="R36fYV"&gt;Five regular people in different parts of the world deal with an invasion by something “not of our Earth,” the president says in an address to her fellow Earthlings. The trailer hints that for some of the people, their encounters with the aliens aren’t their first such encounters. Intrigue! Shamier Anderson, Golshifteh Farahani, Sam Neill, Firas Nassar, and Shioli Kutsuna star in &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt;. The first three episodes of the series will drop on Apple TV Plus October 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xe7mXA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WllZh9aekDg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a8iE3o"&gt;Spencer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PHQ9Wc"&gt;Josh O’Connor and Emma Corwin both won awards for their portrayals of Prince Charles and Princess Diana in the Netflix miniseries &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;, which looked at the unhappy marriage of the royal couple. &lt;em&gt;Spencer&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, focuses on Diana’s decision to leave the philandering Charles, over Christmas weekend in 1991. Much like &lt;em&gt;The Crown,&lt;/em&gt; it adds some melodrama to fill in the blanks of what may have happened behind the scenes, and there is a great deal of positive &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelbrodsky/spencer-trailer-kristen-stewart"&gt;buzz&lt;/a&gt; about Kristen Stewart as Diana. &lt;em&gt;Spencer&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9m84dw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P7PqRDJiWkU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h6bvz4"&gt;I Know What You Did Last Summer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dAFkrP"&gt;I am not sure why we needed a remake of this story or how it will translate into a series, but here we are, with threats scrawled on mirrors in lipstick, a hoodie-wearing stalker/killer, and young people of questionable ethics doing questionable things. There is nary a hook-wielding fisherman in sight in this trailer, however, suggesting it’s not taking all its cues from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiAlcLlJpQE&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;the (dare I say classic) 1997 movie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;I Know What You Did Last Summer&lt;/em&gt;, the series, comes to Amazon Prime Video October 15th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it will fix issue with ‘unlock with Apple Watch’ feature on iPhone 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qLKRnPbHw0I_F0fg3laDOs5zFxE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69911102/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rVDnX2"&gt;Apple says it has identified an issue where the “unlock with Apple Watch” feature might not work with its new iPhone 13 devices. A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212828"&gt;note on its support page&lt;/a&gt; describes the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QP8fBe"&gt;You might see “Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch” if you try to unlock your iPhone while wearing a face mask, or you might not be able to set up Unlock with Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3elcIp"&gt;On Friday, users on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/puglid/unlock_with_apple_watch_not_working_unable_to/"&gt;r/AppleWatch Reddit board&lt;/a&gt; began reporting that they were seeing this problem, and some said they were able to use the Watch unlock feature with other iPhone models, including the iPhone 11 Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDEX1T"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;introduced the ability to unlock an iPhone&lt;/a&gt; that uses Face ID with a paired Apple Watch earlier this year with the release of iOS 14.5. It comes in handy during a pandemic where face masks are recommended in many public places, making it hard for Face ID to recognize you. The &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212208"&gt;feature works&lt;/a&gt; on iPhone X and later, and requires both the iPhone and the Watch to have wi-fi and Bluetooth turned on. The Watch needs to have wrist detection turned on and be passcode-protected, and it has to be on your wrist and unlocked for the feature to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="019zJz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to unlock your iOS 14.5 iPhone with your Apple Watch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403738/iphone-unlock-watch-ios-14-5"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GA5PtA"&gt;Apple didn’t say what’s causing the problem with iPhone 13 devices, just that it will be “fixed in an upcoming software update,” but not when to expect the update. The support page note advises switching off the “unlock with Apple Watch” feature and using your passcode to unlock your iPhone 13 while masked in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="i2F8eA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fgHhLS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tXl1KP"&gt;The team at iFixit has a new teardown of the iPhone 13 Pro, finding it has an enormous battery and some small internal changes to how the components are laid out to accommodate the smaller notch on this year’s models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4DUVl"&gt;First, the battery. After conducting battery swap tests, on the iPhone 13 Pro, iFixit found its tests succeeded, but still got a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F32343%2Fapple-is-locking-batteries-to-iphones-now&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F25%2F22693123%2Fiphone-13-pro-ifixit-teardown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warning notification.&lt;/a&gt; The L-shaped battery echoes the iPhone 12 Pro Max, iFixit notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HInpUx"&gt;This beefy L caps out at an expected 11.97 Wh compared to the 10.78 Wh obelisk found in the iPhone 12 Pro (and non-Pro), but loses out to the standard’s 12.54 Wh rectangular cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vxtXHE"&gt;iFixit posits that Apple was able to shrink the screen notch partly by moving the earpiece speaker from the back of the display to inside the chassis. It does make replacing the earpiece speaker more difficult, iFixit notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XB-bKQOtb76HRX2raPxiZwRDWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22877338/earpiece_ifixit.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dxHGY6"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro is sealed with adhesive, like the iPhone 13 and some prior iPhones, and iFixit says the display came off relatively easily. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly told a TV and movie workers’ union its TV Plus had fewer than 20 million subs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Apple TV+ (Plus) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlEbrp2g2zhJqYZb7Ky9Flk9pXg=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69907526/1233058085.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A union for TV workers says Apple claimed its TV Plus streaming service had fewer than 20 million subscribers as of July 1st | Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qauvj"&gt;Apple told the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) that its Apple TV Plus streaming platform had fewer than 20 million subscribers, which allowed it to pay lower rates to IATSE workers than bigger streaming platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/apple-told-a-showbiz-union-it-had-less-than-20-million-tv-subscribers.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jynhWz"&gt;Apple has never publicly released subscriber numbers for its streaming network, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20850842/apple-tv-plus-release-date-price-shows-oprah-streaming"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in November of 2019. But Apple TV Plus has fewer original shows than larger, more established streaming rivals like Netflix, which &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;said in August&lt;/a&gt; it had 209 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7T5itS"&gt;“Workers on certain ‘new media’ streaming projects get paid less, even on productions with budgets that rival or exceed those of traditionally released blockbusters,” according to a press release IATSE posted on Tuesday. The release didn’t mention any streaming platform by name, but a spokesman told CNBC that Apple claimed under 20 million subscribers in the US and Canada as of July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HpKP6"&gt;The union is preparing for a possible strike after negotiations with production companies have stalled, saying in the release that “the explosion of streaming combined with the pandemic has elevated and aggravated working conditions, bringing 60,000 behind-the-scenes workers covered by these contracts to a breaking point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ALLId"&gt;Apple TV Plus has several big-budget shows on its roster, including &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, its surprise hit comedy about an American coaching an English football club. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; had a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/emmy-awards-2021-list-winners-nominees-11632095321?mod=article_relatedinline"&gt;big showing at the Emmys&lt;/a&gt; last week, taking awards for Outstanding Comedy, Lead Actor in a Comedy for star Jason Sudeikis, and supporting acting awards for Brett Goldstein and Hannah Waddingham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyu1vc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/apples-bumpy-tv-launch-inside-tech-giants-impending-arrival-hollywood-1247577/"&gt;reportedly costs Apple $15 million&lt;/a&gt; per episode, and many of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s writers and stars have &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/ted-lasso-pay-raises-season-three-1235011799/"&gt;reportedly negotiated&lt;/a&gt; more lucrative contracts for the show’s third season. Apple said in July that it had a net profit of $21.7 billion on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;$81.43 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPbyfC"&gt;Apple and IATSE didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. An Apple spokesperson told CNBC that it pays rates comparable to leading streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says an issue is preventing some animations from using high refresh rates on the iPhone 13 Pros</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qE7KKhm4BbsB-hqoA8GkQQwKWzo=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69906241/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSCxYB"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup launched Friday, and one of the key features of the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are their ProMotion displays with variable refresh rates that can top out at 120Hz. But &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/24/iphone-13-promotion-third-party-apps/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some app animations in third-party apps are currently only running at 60Hz. That might be frustrating if you were expecting to see buttery-smooth animations across all of your apps with the new phones, but when we asked Apple what was going on, the company shared two reasons why this might be happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McbI7i"&gt;One reason is that developers will need to update their apps to declare that they use the higher refresh rate. This can be done by adding an entry to the app’s plist, Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and the company says it plans to share documentation about the entry you need to add soon. But in some cases, animations built with the company’s Core Animation technology are also affected by an issue that will be fixed in an upcoming software update, Apple says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3q9Uz"&gt;Variable refresh rate screens offer a lot of benefits, including smoother animations and scrolling when you’re using the device and battery savings the screen runs at lower refresh rates. We were impressed with the screens on the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s good to hear that third party apps will be able to take full advantage of what they have to offer — though some may have to wait until after that software update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lightning port isn’t about convenience; it’s about control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xhSBZJ"&gt;The European Commission shook the iPhone world to its roots this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;announcing a new policy&lt;/a&gt; that would require all smartphones to adopt USB-C ports for physical charging in an effort to reduce e-waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxSmPd"&gt;Apple, of course, doesn’t offer a USB-C iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;having argued to the European Commission in the past&lt;/a&gt; that “Legislation would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers and even more Apple customers worldwide, creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wYvKqy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple obviously prefers Lightning to USB-C&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyc1No"&gt;Switching to USB-C, Apple says, would actually be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; wasteful than sticking with Lightning, since customers would need new cables and adapters — despite the fact that Apple already offers USB-C ports on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8372335/12-inch-macbook-review"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; and has managed to switch over those popular products without major issues or customer revolts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpyaTz"&gt;Notably absent from Apple’s argument, though, is the fact that cutting out a Lightning port on an iPhone wouldn’t just create more e-waste (if you buy Apple’s logic) or inconvenience its customers. It also means that Apple would lose out on the revenue it makes from every Lightning cable and accessory that works with the iPhone, Apple-made or not — along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/21/3793488/apple-changes-iphone-accessory-guidelines-is-not-standing-in-the-way-of-pop-accessory"&gt;control it has&lt;/a&gt; over what kinds of hardware &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/24/3801436/kickstarter-charging-station-pop-back-on-after-apple-changes-lightning-accessory-rules"&gt;does&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/20/3789504/kickstarter-charger-pop-turns-to-competitor-to-process-refunds-apple"&gt;doesn’t&lt;/a&gt;) get to exist for the iPhone and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/3/3451032/apple-lightning-certification-accessory-restrictions"&gt;which companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revokes-monsters-authority-to-make-licensed-accessories-1434481512"&gt;get to make them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhZP2X"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://mfi.apple.com/"&gt;MFi program&lt;/a&gt; means that if you want to plug anything into an iPhone, be it charger or adapter or accessory, you have to go through Apple. And Apple takes a cut of every one of those devices, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca7ugP"&gt;Want to connect an external display? You’ll need an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD826AM%2FA%2Flightning-digital-av-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F24%2F22690338%2Fapple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple-approved adapter&lt;/a&gt;. Import photos and videos from an SD card or flash drive? An &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD821AM%2FA%2Flightning-to-usb-camera-adapter%3Ffnode%3Da07275593a4e170d81156b6668259dc502a6abe2eb6c0ce924c9284c8a53605fa614c8df300fda18d0ae87dfa52f3d6da397bb6af24f8704e28a44772c60a3e40378d4927a3ee59ae4e80ca3a9dd46ac61bff748b417b45d1f0991f0acbf0c77a680f4c5607c22125bd513c593c20e34%26fs%3Df%253Dadapter%2526fh%253D458e%25252B45b0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F24%2F22690338%2Fapple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple-approved adapter&lt;/a&gt;. Want to use a DAC to take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple Music’s new hi-res lossless audio&lt;/a&gt;? Again, you’ll either need an MFi device or an Apple-approved USB dongle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsr815"&gt;The same, of course, isn’t true of Apple’s USB-C-based devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20750137/apple-ipad-pro-usb-c-hubs-hyperdrive-belkin-satechi-kanex"&gt;which have a robust ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; that can broadly be defined as virtually every product that uses USB-C. With a USB-C iPad, you can simply plug in flash drives and keyboards and displays and any number of useful additions that make those devices better. Apple even made a point of that fact during its latest keynote when announcing the new iPad Mini. And of course, USB-C iPads can be charged by any standard USB-C cable that’s capable of putting out enough wattage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjYAaL"&gt;The European Commission's rule could theoretically do the same for iPhones by forcing into existence the USB-C iPhone that Apple has adamantly refused to make thus far. But the new change may mean that Apple could shift towards (or accelerate its plans for) a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;completely portless iPhone instead&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than give into USB-C ports, the company could eschew ports entirely in order to shift customers towards using its proprietary charging methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kJVkbU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The EU’s USB-C proposal might give us a portless iPhone instead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FsqIic"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"&gt;It’s the sort of solution that seems obvious&lt;/a&gt; — it’s practically an intentional loophole in the EU policy — until you consider how little sense a portless iPhone makes, absent Apple’s desire to defend its accessory fees and ecosystem control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmVHtW"&gt;Switching to USB-C, a standard that’s used by virtually every other major tech product (including many of Apple’s own, like its recent MacBook and IPad lineups) would make sense. The iPhone is possibly the most popular device in the world that uses a proprietary charger, and a switch to USB-C would simplify charging setups for the millions of iPhone owners around the world. And USB-C would still allow for similar waterproofing, data transfer, and charging speeds compared to Lightning (as evidenced by any number of Android phones or Apple’s iPads.) There’s a reason the European Commission is looking to institute the new change, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91pWVK"&gt;If the EU allowed Apple to stick with Lightning, keeping that standard around also makes a certain amount of sense, even if it’s frustrating to those (like me) who would prefer a more unified charging standard. Lightning is an established ecosystem that millions of customers already have cables for, with fast data transfer and charging speeds. Like USB-C, it offers waterproofing capabilities, and it gets Apple both its licensing fees and ecosystem control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mz6m3y"&gt;But a portless iPhone that relies on MagSafe (or another wireless standard) is a baffling proposition. It would force millions of customers to have to switch to new chargers, generating tons of e-waste in the process. The result of all that cost and effort would be a charging and data transfer system that is slower and less power efficient in every way compared to wired cables, while also being larger and bulkier than a Lightning or a USB-C wire — just compare the size of one of Apple’s MagSafe cables, or the smallest Qi wireless charger, to a regular wired plug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pLiv34"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple could weather a switch to USB-C just fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="erbqvz"&gt;Apple is a $2.4 trillion company; it likely would be just fine without the revenues it gets from Lightning cable fees, should it switch to USB-C entirely. After all, there’s still plenty of proprietary Apple chargers and technologies out there to license, too, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, AirPlay, Find My, or the rumored new magnetic laptop chargers that may be in the works for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWMXCq"&gt;But profits aside, a switch to USB-C would mean relinquishing another piece of control over what iPhone owners can do with their devices outside of Apple’s carefully curated walled garden. And that, as we’ve seen time and again, is something that Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;loath to allow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much that free iPhone really costs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aoo6ErNbF9KL1EZXp8uvg7yf2gU=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69904305/lcimg_8043788f_4592_4b97_9d19_6cf11041bc74.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prices for iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone Pro Max, as announced at the 2021 Apple Event.&lt;/em&gt; | Sean Hollister&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0oPG4N"&gt;With all the carriers dangling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;sweet, sweet trade-in and upgrade offers&lt;/a&gt; to essentially give you a “free” iPhone 13 (or two) this year, one can’t help but wonder: which one is the best deal? In this case, that would be the offer that costs you the least money but gets you the iPhone you want. Between all the convoluted conditions and confusing industry jargon, the carriers certainly don’t make it easy to compare different offers or make clear what you’re signing up for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJ8Hta"&gt;Carriers might be eager to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;sign up new customers for their bottom lines&lt;/a&gt;, but you need to look out for yours too. After all, is it better to opt for a cheaper unlimited plan that requires a 36-month commitment or get instant trade-in credits to pay a little less sales tax upfront? Should you look for deals that give you instant trade-in credits or get trade-in credits in the form of bill credits over the course of your agreement? It’s sometimes hard to understand all the details until you’ve already signed the contract. To save you the trouble, I took a closer look at the fine print of these deals and did some back-of-the-napkin calculations to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lQYt37"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"},{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"},{"title":"How to buy the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCbB4ruy8_POK4LyN7eYl8Gt1vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874502/lcimg_a194780c_218b_4835_a70c_847baa93d76f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of the carrier trade-in offers are so aggressive that you can get an iPhone 13 Pro for “free.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EaCcga"&gt;In this case, I wanted to figure out which deal offers the best overall value over the long term. For example, what are my upfront and long-term costs in getting the newest iPhone for as low as free? For the sake of this exercise, I pretended to be a new customer in New York City, shopping for a single phone line, who wants to trade her iPhone 11 for an iPhone 13 or an iPhone 13 Pro,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSsTVt"&gt;Some important caveats about the numbers I’ll be referencing: they are by no means definitive and only serve to demonstrate how these deals work. For one thing, these carrier offers are time-sensitive and may already be different by the time you read this. The specifics of your carrier plan are influenced by many personal factors, like your credit history, your local tax rate, how many lines you need, and any special discounts that you’re eligible for (e.g., military/veteran). I can only present a relatively basic set of numbers that don’t reflect all the many possible variations in the universe, so take my numbers with a grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMqT8G"&gt;After comparing similar offers from AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile / Sprint, Verizon, Apple.com, I’ve noticed a few tips that would help you shop for the best deal for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1u5JP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My key takeaways...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DX9LdWjvrdsw3twULvMGJi2t2tQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874503/lcimg_998e9575_72ad_4040_91eb_7203d774a004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In some scenarios, it might make sense to pay for a device in full and instant trade-in credits, rather than rely on trade-in credits in the form of bill credits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9wZNK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the plans, not the free phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPPJpa"&gt;Most of the trade-in credits are so high that they basically cover the cost of an iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro — assuming your trade-in device is from the past two years and in good condition. So when you look at these deals, you should not get distracted by the allure of a free iPhone. Instead, focus on the cost of the plan after 24 to 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYHS5M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Length Matters Most&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrP3h3"&gt;The duration of the contract has the biggest impact on separating the best value deal from the bad. While AT&amp;amp;T offers the cheapest unlimited plan among its competition ($65/month), after 36 months (the required length you need to have service for to get the best offer), it ended up costing the most money ($2,445.30). Since most of its rivals’ plans are only 24 months long, I did the math on the AT&amp;amp;T plan at 24 months just so that I could compare apples to apples. It turns out the $65-per-month plan is the least expensive one after 24 months ($1,630.20) and is even cheaper than the special promotion between Apple and T-Mobile / Sprint ($1,713.60), which includes an extra $500 discount on the phone when you sign up for the $85 Magenta / Sprint Max plan. It’s worth gaming out the full cost of the plan for the duration of the contract before you sign on the line because this is where you’ll be spending the majority of your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxJeXh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant Trade-in Credits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmQkZL"&gt;If you can pay for the balance of your phone in full at the time of purchase and live near an eligible Apple store, you might want to take advantage of the instant trade-in credits that Apple offers. The beauty of the instant trade-in credit is that you get the value right at the time of purchase, which lowers the sales tax you pay at checkout — unlike the online trade-in process where your device has to be mailed to a third party to be evaluated, before its actual value will be credited to your monthly bills in a few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5Jmy6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trade-offs with Trade-ins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpKrTX"&gt;Although my hypothetical trade-in credit for the iPhone 11 (between $800 and $1,000) effectively renders my monthly device payments to $0, because I am required to be on a monthly device payment plan as part of any trade-in offer, I may not terminate my device plan earlier than 24 months. If I do, I would be responsible for paying for the balance of this “free” iPhone, lose the remaining value from my trade-in device, and (potentially) pay an early termination penalty. Now, if I paid for the device upfront (ideally with an instant trade-in credit), I could choose a plan that better reflects my actual data consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMYJp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm4lO4"&gt;In some cases, the carrier might require you to pay a down payment or an activation fee, and offer you different contract lengths based on your credit history. While you won’t be paying for your iPhone directly when your trade-in credit kicks in, you still have to pay the sales tax on the full price of the phone — there is no bill credit to reimburse that cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuCwrG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Winner: Verizon &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL7vlP"&gt;Out of all the carrier offers, Verizon actually had the lowest overall costs with its 24-month payment plans, even though it doesn’t have the cheapest 5G plan or the shortest agreement length. At $2,077.36 for the iPhone 13 and $2,285.36 for the iPhone 13 Pro, these totals don’t even include the $500 gift card that Verizon is offering to customers who switch providers. The most expensive carrier offer, on the other hand, is from AT&amp;amp;T and its extra-long 36-month contract. Not only does it cost more of your hard-earned money, but your iPhone 13 will be so out-of-date after three years that you may want to pay to end your contract early. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WcByte"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10766269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yxLCVZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ObBKh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10766838"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sou97r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, September 27th, 2021 at 11:59AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the trade-in value of an iPhone 11 used towards an iPhone 13 Pro from T-Mobile and Verizon. The iPhone 13 Pro chart has been updated to reflect the correct trade-in values ($800), as well as the corresponding monthly payments and total costs. The copy has also been updated with the correct total cost of the iPhone 13 Pro trade-in offer from Verizon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 Mini still gets slower MagSafe charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWeuXMt7N7rde9EUNmOF4cRROwU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903718/vpavic_210918_4760_0703.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HLI4SC"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is out Friday, and while it has a number of welcome improvements over the 12 Mini, it shares one limitation with its predecessor: the 13 Mini is still limited to peak power delivery of up 12 watts over MagSafe wireless charging, according to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211829"&gt;an Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/iphone-13-mini-12w-magsafe/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That means it, like the 12 Mini, has a lower maximum MagSafe charging speed than the rest of the iPhone 13 lineup, which can all charge at up to 15 watts over MagSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHvjDm"&gt;While it might be disappointing to hear that the smallest iPhone can charge slower over MagSafe, it does have improved battery life. Apple says you should get up to 1.5 hours more battery life than you would with the iPhone 12 Mini, so you may not need to charge the 13 Mini as often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MASWUp"&gt;That said, the 13 Mini offers less battery life than the rest of the iPhone 13 models, and it can still run out quickly. Here’s Dieter Bohn’s early impressions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;from his review&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hoFcnE"&gt;However, I do have an early impression of the iPhone 13 Mini’s battery life. It’s that Apple’s one-and-a-half hour longer claim seems reasonable, but that is faint praise. I used the iPhone 12 Mini a lot over the last year, and what I said when I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;first reviewed it&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be true: if you use this little phone like it’s a big smartphone, you will drain the battery by early afternoon or even lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycbIf"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic both in size and also in how much you use them. If you are constantly using your phone all day, the smaller battery in the Mini isn’t likely to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
