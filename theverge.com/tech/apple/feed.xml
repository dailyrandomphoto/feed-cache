    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KipPia1gaxnOLI5WAvLtRaxJMmM=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511532/Apple_fitnessplus_applewatch_iphone12_hiit_workout_12142020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ExdzK"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163126/apple-fitness-plus-launch-date-subscription-service-price"&gt;Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; service is officially out now, marking the launch of the company’s latest subscription service. Fitness Plus offers a variety of guided workouts (similar to competitors like Peloton) and costs $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1uP46"&gt;At launch, the service features workouts in 10 categories: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), strength, yoga, dance, core, cycling, treadmill (for both running and walking), rowing, and “mindful cooldown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Is0lNI"&gt;To actually use Fitness Plus, you’ll need — at minimum — an Apple Watch Series 3 (or newer) running the just-released watchOS 7.2 update paired to an iPhone 6S (or newer) running the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22163752/ios-14-3-proraw-airpods-max-fitness-plus-available-now-download"&gt;also-just-released iOS 14.3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3613O"&gt;If you’re planning to use an iPad or Apple TV to view Fitness Plus videos, you’ll also need to have those devices updated to iOS 14.3 or tvOS 14.3, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pONw5l"&gt;Once you’ve updated your iPhone and Apple Watch, Fitness Plus can be accessed through a new tab in the Fitness app that’s preinstalled on your phone. iPad users will be able to download the Fitness app from the App Store, while Apple TV users will automatically see the app installed once they’ve updated to tvOS 14.3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i1f3q"&gt;Existing Apple Watch owners can get a one-month free trial of Fitness Plus, while customers who buy an Apple Watch Series 3 (or newer) can get three months of free service. A single Fitness Plus subscription can be shared with up to six users through Apple’s Family Sharing service, and it’s also included in the Apple One Premier plan (which includes Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, and 2TB of iCloud storage for $29.95 per month).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.3 has arrived with ProRAW for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 Pro camera app in use" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2qMsMMZNsBnOi0Z23G2uJ_9sEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510836/akrales_201017_4238_0016.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;With iOS 14.3, the iPhone 12 Pro camera app will support a new kind of RAW image capture | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TnaGT5"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.3 has arrived, giving iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max owners the ProRAW feature that was promised when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21504764/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-screen-size-5g-features-price-release-date"&gt;devices were announced&lt;/a&gt;. Other features in this update include search improvements for the Apple TV app, support for Fitness Plus  — Apple’s new subscription-based workout service — and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;recently announced AirPods Max headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iIXoU"&gt;iPhones have long been able to capture RAW images, but doing so has meant giving up the benefits of all the computational magic that happens when shooting a standard image with the native camera app. ProRAW is designed to address that: it’s a format that combines the computational benefits of Apple’s image processing with the post-processing flexibility of a RAW file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqPupH"&gt;In iOS 14.3, Apple is flipping the ProRAW “on” switch for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max — and those two devices only. With the update installed, ProRAW image capture and editing will be enabled in the native camera and photos apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Y0fbua"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro review: ahead of its time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: the best smartphone camera you can get","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oth5QR"&gt;This update also addresses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169881/apple-iphone-ios-14-text-messages-no-notifications-bug"&gt;an irritating bug&lt;/a&gt; where some users weren’t getting notifications for new incoming messages. And on the lighter side, Siri gets an update with hundreds of animal, instruments, and vehicle sounds. The new feature works on HomePod, iPhones and iPads; just ask Siri what sound a humpback whale makes and you’ll get a demonstration. If you’re on an iPhone or iPad, you’ll also get a visual to go along with the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLTutb"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/08/ios-14-3-release-candidate-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, 14.3 also makes it easier to customize app icons since home screen shortcuts no longer need to open the Shortcuts app. Other iOS 14.3 highlights include the ability to record video at 25fps, updates to Apple TV app search and a new Apple TV Plus tab, front-facing camera mirroring in still photos for devices from the iPhone 6S and newer, and new Cycle Tracking features in the Health app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches new App Store privacy labels so you can see how iOS apps use your data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foLTsv1S9sSgbk_TvqGmKOS1qiA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510737/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nyix9w"&gt;Apple is making good on its promise to provide more transparency around iOS app data collection with the launch of new privacy labels on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzS8jj"&gt;The company first announced its intention to provide these so-called “nutrition label” privacy disclosures &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;back in June during WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, and last month Apple disclosed that developers would have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551926/apple-privacy-developers-nutrition-labels-app-store-ios-14"&gt;provide this information by December 8th&lt;/a&gt; or risk losing the ability to update their apps. Now, following that deadline, Apple is launching the feature officially for all iOS device owners running the latest version of iOS 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q6tEa"&gt;Apple says the new labels will be required for apps on all of its platforms — that includes iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — and they will have to be up to date and accurate every time a developer submits a new update. Apple is also holding itself to the same standard, something the company clarified last week when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;Facebook-owned WhatsApp criticized the company&lt;/a&gt; for an apparent inconsistency in its requirements, before Apple said it, too, will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165959/apple-privacy-nutrition-labels-all-apps-preinstalled-messages-web"&gt;provide labels for all its own software&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cszf52"&gt;The company’s own first-party apps will all have the same disclosures on their App Store product pages. In the event an app doesn’t have an App Store product page because it cannot be removed, like the Messages app, Apple says it will be providing privacy label information on the web. Every piece of software on the App Store will also have its privacy label viewable on the web, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p6KlEhLz0kQr5rC5lJ6tl5cQVTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168998/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_10.33.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R49pJY"&gt;As for how the labels are structured, Apple has broken down data collection into three categories: “data used to track you,” “data linked to you,” and “data not linked to you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Mg0q"&gt;Tracking in this context means the app developer is linking data from the app — like personal information, or data collected from your device, such as location data — with other data from other companies’ apps or websites for the purpose of targeted advertising or some other ad-related metric. Apple says it’s also using the term tracking here to mean sharing user or device information with companies that sell it, like data brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7m37s"&gt;The “data linked to you” portion of the label is any data that can be used to identify you. That means data gleaned from using the app or having an account with the service or platform, and any data pulled from the device itself that could be used to create a profile for advertising purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKBRDn"&gt;“Data not linked to you” is the portion of the privacy label that clarifies when certain data types, like location data or browsing history, are not being linked to you in any identifiable fashion. Apple has specific, developer-focused information on the new labels &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/"&gt;at its developer portal page&lt;/a&gt;, with more general information available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapple.com%2Fprivacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174017%2Fapple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the consumer-facing page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFjT8f"&gt;This isn’t the last of Apple’s major privacy changes coming with iOS 14. The company intends to release a new privacy feature requiring developers to ask for explicit permission to track iOS device users across apps and websites using a unique device identifier, called an IDFA (or Identification for Advertisers) code. The plan was to require this with the launch of iOS 14, but Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;announced in September&lt;/a&gt; that it would delay the feature until some time next year, to give developers more time to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is offering two-hour delivery for just $5 for a limited time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4CjD4Dc-aHIXVZevPiiPAw2S2Xg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510623/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8bGSNF"&gt;Apple is offering two-hour delivery for just $5 on “eligible in-stock items” from its retail stores. If you need to get a gift for an Apple-loving person in your life this holiday season, that $5 shipping could be a handy way to get that gift in a pinch. The company says it offers scheduled courier delivery of eligible items “in most metros.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQkRCI"&gt;That low $5 fee won’t last forever, though — in the fine print on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fshipping-pickup&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174360%2Fapple-two-hour-delivery-price-holidays#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it’s a limited time offer. And you can’t use it on customized Macs, engraved products, or orders paid with financing or by bank transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAVkF1"&gt;If you don’t need your purchase within two hours, Apple says it offers free next-day delivery on any in-stock Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, or Apple Watch, and free two-day delivery on “almost everything else.” The company also has a useful guide that lists &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fholiday-shipping&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174360%2Fapple-two-hour-delivery-price-holidays#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;when you’ll need to order a product&lt;/a&gt; in order to get it by December 24th with free shipping, though some items, like the HomePod mini, are already unavailable for delivery by Christmas Eve with free shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9st2en"&gt;Apple is also allowing you to initiate returns for “eligible products received between November 10, 2020 and December 25, 2020” until January 8th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020: bad year, good gadgets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OQqLTrxs-WRnsuQMaVYmqYyoRIE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68509995/VRG_ILLO_4320_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Game hardware and laptops both started promising new generations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="if2UI8"&gt;It doesn’t feel right to praise much of anything in 2020, but here goes: the gadgets were good. In a year when many of us have been more dependent than ever on our screens to stay connected, do our jobs, and just stay sane, the technology behind them has been better than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdyWAj"&gt;Big tech promised generational changes in consumer technology this year. The new Macs and the new gaming hardware we got in 2020 really have kicked off noticeably different and better eras in computing. I don’t like using grandiose phrases like “eras in computing,” but there’s really no other way to put it. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony, and AMD &lt;em&gt;actually delivered&lt;/em&gt; on their bombastic claims. That’s not usually how it goes. It’s a little bewildering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwVwTa"&gt;So yes, there were the usual hits and misses in this year’s gadgets, but what’s different is the hits were blockbusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7vIpR"&gt;The biggest star has to be the M1 chip in Apple’s new laptops and the Mac Mini. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;very nearly gave the MacBook Air a perfect score&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, a processor transition means app incompatibility problems that go on for years, but you have to go to strange edge cases to find apps that just don’t work. Normally, apps designed for the old chips run slow, but in some cases, they run faster on the M1. Normally, speed improvements and battery improvements are measured in single percentage points, but these laptops are astonishingly fast and last forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="UnRvkH"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="M1 MacBook Pro and Air review: Apple delivers|96773" data-volume-uuid="6412f55d2" data-volume-id="96773" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-402" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9l52"&gt;It’s hard to express what a big deal this is. More than once, we would have to double- and triple-check our test results because they seemed too good to be true. I do not know how Windows PCs are going to respond. Thus far, emulated apps that run in Windows on Arm have been slow and buggy, while Intel-based machines are unlikely to match the M1’s battery life. It’s going to be a tough row for the entire PC industry to hoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNU2EG"&gt;Then there’s the new slate of gaming hardware, which all seemed to land at once and which all seem to be impossible to find at any retail site. Before this year, getting 4K, HDR, and high refresh rates all at the same time was a stretch goal at best. After 2020, it’s accessible on PC or console (assuming you can find the hardware in stock and buy it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snHnKU"&gt;The new graphics cards from both Nvidia and AMD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;force away the trade-offs gamers usually have to make in their graphics settings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-reviewhttps://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and S&lt;/a&gt; don’t have a slate of next-gen launch titles, but they have competently and quietly made existing games run faster and look better. And they also have a ton of potential for the future with Microsoft’s Game Pass Ultimate subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="iEsayI"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="PlayStation 5 Review: a next-gen feel|96572" data-volume-uuid="eae294ab6" data-volume-id="96572" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-864" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uXiAyI"&gt;The Playstation 5, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;surprised us all by having a new controller that offers some genuinely new and engaging experiences&lt;/a&gt;. It seems weird to enthuse about haptics and trigger resistance, but you really can feel the difference. The PS5’s fundamentals as a console are also strong — though the design of course remains polarizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9kKAs"&gt;Taken as a whole, the new PC graphics cards and the new consoles really do represent the beginning of a set of next-gen gaming experiences. And unlike the last time we got a big console refresh, it doesn’t seem like any of them have significantly stumbled out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGeWA1"&gt;The phones of 2020 were also great. It’s hard to remember because it was a thousand years ago, but Samsung’s Galaxy S20 line launched in March as the first flagship 5G phones. It’s weird to suggest that anything Samsung does is quiet, but the S20 and S20 plus were just quietly the best Android phones this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TgPWVL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Samsung Galaxy S20 review: better than the Ultra|75203" data-volume-uuid="dc391ca04" data-volume-id="75203" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-439" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSFjkN"&gt;5G turned out to be the most explicit claim to making something “next generation” that did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pan out. In the US especially, 5G is only slightly better than 4G for people who can find a signal in the first place. Even so, the phones that were meant to usher in the 5G era were great — not because they had 5G, but because they were simply well-made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yabrti"&gt;The new iPhones were also great — and launched along with a confident claim that “5G is real now.” But as with Samsung’s phones, the iPhone 12 lineup is great despite 5G, not because of it. The iPhone 12 mini, in particular, finally made a top-tier phone available to people who have felt that everything since the iPhone 5S was too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GytRYJ"&gt;Hell, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 finally made good on the promise of the original&lt;/a&gt;. Overpriced and blingy? Yes. But also a really good little tablet that folds up. I know at least one &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor who I shall not name (it’s not me) who bought one and loves it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovOg71"&gt;Then there are the gadgets that don’t purport to be next-gen anything but nevertheless were simply &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG G14 Zephyrus gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;GoPro Hero 9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550181/dji-mavic-mini-2-drone-4k-price-release-date-battery-life"&gt;DJI’s Mini 2 drone getting OcuSync wireless&lt;/a&gt; and its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21517121/dji-ronin-s2-sc2-rs2-rsc2-gimbals-announced-price"&gt;Ronan gimbals getting built-in focus wheels&lt;/a&gt;; Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514758/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;Mario Kart Live Home Circuit remote control AR cars&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof S3 e-bike&lt;/a&gt;; Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;WH-1000XM4 headphones&lt;/a&gt;; and Dell’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;latest XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. Even smart speakers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; significantly improved their sound while Apple finally hit a reasonable price point with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2Zovz"&gt;I wish I could tell you what ties this year’s wave of good gadgets into a coherent trend. It wouldn’t be right to tie any of this to the pandemic — the lead times on everything mentioned here are such that they would have begun development well before lockdown. Certainly there was an effort to make “next-gen” products feel worthy of the description, but I don’t think that explains it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GdJ5B3"&gt;If I’m honest, I think it’s just luck. A bunch of technologies happened to mature around the same time and a bunch of companies happened to be ready to do something with them. In a year when so many things have gone predictably bad, it’s nice that this one small thing was unpredictably nice. The gadgets were good. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KP7G9F"&gt;Workers at an iPhone production plant in India reportedly smashed windows and set fire to vehicles to protest reductions in pay, the &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/violence-breaks-out-at-wistron-corps-iphone-manufacturing-plant-near-bengaluru/articleshow/79691511.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times of India &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The incidents began Saturday at a facility run by Taiwan manufacturing company Wistron Corporation, where the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/24/iphone-se-assembled-in-india/"&gt; iPhone SE is assembled.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIUGQr"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/angry-at-delayed-payments-employees-ransack-narsapura-plant-where-iphones-are-made-7102392/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian Express&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; during a shift change workers who said they had seen their pay reduced damaged the offices, some furniture, and factory equipment before things escalated outside. A local official told the &lt;em&gt;Express &lt;/em&gt;that police were investigating the incident. About 2,000 workers were involved in the protest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iPhone has an aggravating text notifications bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nxqCkC8QD0tyrV9CGDhB2Hs0MDE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68498188/akrales_201018_4238_0435.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FqOH0y"&gt;If you’ve noticed that you’re receiving SMS texts and iMessages from people but aren’t getting any notifications about them, you’re not alone. Far from it. I’m one of many people experiencing an annoying bug where messages come through fine — but without any pop-up notification or even the usual red badge to indicate that there’s a new message waiting to be read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsOeVu"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/13/iphone-12-missing-sms-text-messages/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; wrote about increasing reports of the problem&lt;/a&gt; on the new iPhone 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max phones. But it seems to also be affecting people with older iPhones as well, so this is looking more and more like an iOS 14 issue. What’s more aggravating about the glitch is that it doesn't &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; happen. I’ve noticed some messages pop up on my lock screen like normal, but others just quietly roll in with me being none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfDAlB"&gt;People in that very large &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; thread have tried to come up with workarounds like turning off Messages on a Mac, or deleting and re-adding contacts. Some are noticing they get notifications if they completely force close the Messages app every time after sending a text. And in other cases, the missing notifications are only happening for pinned conversations, and unpinning contacts seems to do the trick. There are sporadic reports of success with these short-term fixes, but they aren’t working for everyone. There’s also &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251815788"&gt;this 42-page thread on the company’s support forums&lt;/a&gt; about the ongoing frustrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o91b1E"&gt;Those dealing with the issue are understandably disappointed that Apple hasn’t released a thorough fix yet. This is pretty fundamental stuff, and it’s probably causing some awkward conversations between couples or friends when messages just sit there for hours without the recipient knowing they came. And if you’re hoping that all will be well when iOS 14.3 releases next week, I wouldn’t be so sure. Early reports indicate that the no-text-notifications bug remains present — at least in some cases — in the second release candidate build of iOS 14.3 that Apple pushed out to public beta testers yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A4RJ9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Apple for more information on the status of this bug and the company’s plans to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Apple are banning technology for sharing users’ location data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5KvBPc2-u8EerPigOQpDLLmZy8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68498063/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SWMuy4"&gt;You may have never heard of the company X-Mode Social, but its code may be in some of the apps on your phone, tracking and selling your location data. Now, Google and Apple are trying to put a stop to it. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-and-google-to-stop-x-mode-from-collecting-location-data-from-users-phones-11607549061"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;, the tech companies have told developers to remove X-Mode’s code from their apps, or risk getting them pulled from their respective app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7JPFi"&gt;X-Mode works by giving developers code to put into their apps, known as an SDK, which tracks users’ location and then sends that data to X-Mode, which sells it. In return, X-Mode pays the developer a certain amount based on how many users the app has. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj454d/private-intelligence-location-data-xmode-hyas"&gt;According to the company&lt;/a&gt;, its technology is in over 400 apps, including many apps designed for Muslim users, such as one that reminds users when to pray, and a Muslim-focused dating app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snhtj4"&gt;Apple is giving developers two weeks to remove the SDK, and Google is giving devs one week, with the ability to apply for an extension to 30 days. But the model of tracking users’ locations and selling the data is nothing new: what may have gotten X-Mode banned was that, according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x"&gt;it was also selling it to the US military&lt;/a&gt;. When you consider the fact that many of the largest apps using the X-Mode were designed for Muslim populations, it’s understandable why this would be concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6t6IR"&gt;Of course, government services buying citizens’ location data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371886/secret-service-usss-locate-x-babel-street-foia-contract-report"&gt;is nothing new&lt;/a&gt;, but most of the time they buy it from data brokers, who just aggregate the information from various sources, not from companies collecting it directly. For its part, X-Mode claims it’s being singled out, saying that it “collects similar mobile app data as most advertising SDKs”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq5GkD"&gt;To wrap this up with a PSA: X-Mode, and other companies like it, can only get your location data when given permission. Often apps don’t make it clear that your location data is going to X-Mode (it’s either buried in a EULA, or not there at all), but every app on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21005009/iphone-location-tracking-how-to-on-off-apps-apple-find-my-friends"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372603/google-android-location-sharing-maps-how-to-enable-disable"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; will have to ask for permission to be able to see your location. If your level app (as in, the tool you use to make sure a picture isn’t crooked) is asking for permission for your location, it’s probably worth thinking about whether or not it actually needs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jncKIU"&gt;Of course, that won’t protect you in cases where the app has an actual reason to use your location (such as with a dating app), which is why it’s good that both Apple and Google, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917988/ron-wyden-facebook-privacy-data-regulation-do-not-track"&gt;some lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;, are starting to take a harder look at how companies sell user data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qRJqhM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Americans are sick and tired of their data being misused and abused by anyone with a checkbook. Apple and Google deserve credit for doing the right thing here, but there’s still more work to be done to protect Americans’ privacy. &lt;a href="https://t.co/AirdebtLFx"&gt;https://t.co/AirdebtLFx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1337088182068760576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Apple’s old 29W chargers aren’t good enough for MagSafe Duo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aKC8xJQE0JxirWITjx_iRneaXqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68495649/dbohn_201109_4283_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="px1WFU"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211925"&gt;Apple support page&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that the company’s new MagSafe Duo wireless charger, which is designed to charge an iPhone and Apple Watch simultaneously, isn’t compatible with its older 29W USB-C power adapter. If you’re using an Apple power adapter it’s best to use one of the company’s newer 30W models, which &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/04/apple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter/"&gt;replaced the 29W model in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and retail for $49. It’s an unfortunate revelation for anyone with the old chargers since the MagSafe Duo doesn’t come with a charging brick in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rogl9"&gt;Apple’s page doesn’t say exactly what happens if you plug the MagSafe Duo into one of the older 29W bricks. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/magsafe-duo-incompatible-with-apple-29w-charger/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that if you do it will only be able to charge a single device, an iPhone or an Apple Watch, rather than both at once. Although the 29W brick appears to meet the wattage requirements of the MagSafe Duo, it apparently doesn’t support the exact combination of volts and amps required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3VkLm6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Working out MagSafe’s charging speeds is a little complicated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WRBh1x"&gt;At this point, working out how fast each of Apple’s MagSafe accessories will charge your devices is a little bit complicated. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHXH3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F11%2F22169285%2Fapple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-brick-magsafe-duo-incompatible#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt; charges iPhones at up to 15W, and Apple recommends pairing it with a $19 Apple 20W USB-C power adapter. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHXF3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-duo-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F11%2F22169285%2Fapple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-brick-magsafe-duo-incompatible#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Duo charger&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, offers up to a slightly lower 14W of charging when paired with a 27W or higher brick, so long as that brick supports 9V/3A. You get 11W of charging by pairing it with a 20W power brick that supports 9V/2.22A, and Apple says you need “at least 15W (5V/3A or 9V/1.67A)” for the Duo to charge two devices simultaneously. If you’re charging an iPhone 12 mini, the maximum charge is capped at 12W with the Duo. Oh, and the maximum charge is also capped at 7.5W if you’re charging your phone with a Lightning accessory (like a pair of headphones) plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kteyRr"&gt;Plenty of devices have very specific requirements for the hardware you need to use to get the fastest charging speeds, so it’s hard to blame Apple too much here. But I think we can all agree that it could have made things much simpler for customers if it included a power brick in the box with its $129 wireless charger.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is now building the chip it needs to ditch Qualcomm like it ditched Intel</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wlq4QB"&gt;This fall, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;changed how we thought about laptops overnight&lt;/a&gt;. It replaced the Intel processors in its MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with its own homegrown ARM chips instead — and though we were initially skeptical about Apple’s silicon transition, the final product &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;blew us away&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9O24bs"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/apple-starts-work-on-its-own-cellular-modem-chip-chief-says?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s chip chief has internally revealed that a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; chip transition is also already in the early stages: a cellular modem that could mean far less need (if any) for Qualcomm chips in Apple’s products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JwfE6"&gt;“This year, we kicked off the development of our first internal cellular modem which will enable another key strategic transition,” Apple hardware SVP Johny Srouji reportedly said, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RRLybX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s only a matter of time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbRI5t"&gt;If you’ve been following Apple’s struggles with Intel and Qualcomm, this won’t come as much of a surprise: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;Apple bought Intel’s smartphone modem business last July&lt;/a&gt;, which strongly suggested it was only a matter of time before Apple used that purchase to develop its own radio chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fDF3T"&gt;Qualcomm has more than physical radio chips going for it, of course; it also has a tremendous amount of intellectual property around cellular that it licenses to companies like Apple (and has been accused of using in anticompetitive ways, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363629/qualcomm-win-appeal-antitrust-ftc-lawsuit-frand-patents-chips"&gt;it recently won an antitrust suit&lt;/a&gt; against the FTC). Ahead of Apple’s purchase of Intel’s modem business, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18411332/intel-exiting-5g-smartphone-modem-market-apple-qualcomm-settle-dispute"&gt;it reached a surprise settlement with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; over patent infringement and struck a multiyear deal around the companies’ wireless IP — one where it wound up paying Qualcomm $4.5 billion, and where Apple wound up getting the Qualcomm chips it needed to build this year’s 5G iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQdu4U"&gt;With its own cellular radios, Apple could at least be less reliant on Qualcomm. At best, it could build a better performing radio and offer better battery life, like it did with its new ARM chips vs. Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvF4Xc"&gt;To be honest, the most surprising thing about the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is that an Apple town hall meeting leaked &lt;em&gt;at all, &lt;/em&gt;considering how secretive the company typically is. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/apple-s-cook-says-most-staff-won-t-return-to-office-until-june"&gt;when employees might return to the company’s physical offices&lt;/a&gt; during that meeting, saying it “seems likely” that most teams won’t return before June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
