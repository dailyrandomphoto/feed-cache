  &lt;p&gt;‘The AV industry has promised too much for too long, and has delivered too little’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="30PAVY"&gt;After years of positive vibes about the future of autonomous vehicles and nearly unrestricted access to cash from Kool-Aid-drunk venture capitalists, the AV industry is confronting some hard truths. The first is that autonomous vehicles are going to take a lot longer to reach mass scale than previously thought. The second is that it’s going to be a lot more expensive, too. And the third hard truth: going it alone is no longer a viable option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGpFNZ"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404406/toyota-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-acquisition-amount-deal"&gt;Lyft sold its self-driving car division to a subsidiary of Toyota&lt;/a&gt; for $550 million. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331794/cruise-acquires-voyage-self-driving-car-merger"&gt;Cruise bought Voyage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;Aurora merged with Uber’s autonomous vehicle unit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-acquires-autonomous-trucking-startup-ike/"&gt;Delivery robot startup Nuro acquired self-driving truck outfit Ike&lt;/a&gt;. There have been so many mergers, joint ventures, and various tie-ups lately it can be difficult to keep them all straight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jdlfYW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It can be difficult to keep them all straight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vnWQC"&gt;Where that leaves things is a little unclear. There is still money flowing to these companies, and nearly all of the executives, engineers, and software developers working on the technology remain bullish about the future. But there is a growing sense among experts and investors that the heady days when anyone with a couple of test vehicles, some LIDAR, and a vision for the future could launch a startup are at an end. And there will definitely be more shrinkage to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETwHio"&gt;“The consolidation is long overdue,” said &lt;a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~raj/"&gt;Raj Rajkumar&lt;/a&gt;, robotics professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “The AV industry has promised too much for too long, and has delivered too little.”   &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QynkTW"&gt;There are other signs of general unease in the AV world. Last month, John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364317/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-stepping-down-self-driving-cars-google-alphabet"&gt;announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Waymo&lt;/a&gt; after helping lead the company since 2015. Krafcik oversaw the transformation of Google’s self-driving car division from “Project Chauffeur” to its own standalone company. During his time, Waymo struck partnerships with several automakers, launched a limited ride-hailing pilot with fully driverless vehicles in Arizona, and expanded its commercial ambitions to include trucking and last-mile delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB9dP6"&gt;As a former auto executive with years of experience at Hyundai and Ford, Krafcik was seen as someone who could bring self-driving cars to the mainstream. But his decision to step aside at a time of heightened uncertainty highlights the difficult road ahead for self-driving cars — especially as many of those early predictions have failed to come to pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3mGhGQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Krafcik’s decision to step aside at a time of heightened uncertainty highlights the difficult road ahead&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fHGm9p"&gt;Krafcik was not able to bring to market an autonomous vehicle that can drive on any road and in any conditions without years of rigorous testing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;Aside from a small area outside Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, Waymo’s cars require backup drivers to monitor the vehicle’s operations and take control if anything goes wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjlTTe"&gt;Waymo still has a commanding lead in autonomous vehicles, but diminished expectations about the future of self-driving cars are affecting its business in other ways, too. In 2018, Morgan Stanley published a research note &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/29/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-unit-morgan-stanley-forecast-to-highs.html"&gt;valuing the company at $175 billion&lt;/a&gt; based on its perceived leadership in the space and the potential for massive amounts of revenue from its autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHRytl"&gt;A year later, the bank slashed Waymo’s valuation to $105 billion, still an extraordinary amount of money for a company with no revenue. But last year, when Waymo announced its first external funding round of $2.25 billion, the company declined to discuss what valuation that investment was based on. Later, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed8dc4ca-5eaf-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; it to be $30 billion — a nearly 85 percent decrease from 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3w20R"&gt;Valuations aren’t the sole indicator of where things stand with autonomous vehicles. But they do point to investor sentiment. And right now, investors are not feeling as confident in the prediction that autonomous vehicles will soon become the dominant form of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnwAE1Ee3kIxKoL1SoQ-oUd23l0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10793777/Van_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Drive.ai&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq6Ud7"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/faculty/missy-cummings"&gt;Missy Cummings&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University, has been criticizing rosy predictions about our driverless future. She’s consistently warned that the technology is much further away and harder to get right than anyone in the industry cares to admit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoCPjO"&gt;The recent trend in consolidation is vindication for her position, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZG8EQ1"&gt;“It’s kind of like the elephant in the room,” she said of the shrinking of the AV world. “People will mention that and then they’ll stop themselves from making the Socratic connection to what this means about the viability of this industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jl1Ncp"&gt;But Cummings doesn’t think people in the industry will be able to ignore the truth for much longer. “There is an embarrassingly large sum of money that’s been invested in this, so people feel like they have to keep going down that path because surely all these people who invested all this money can’t be wrong,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J1W5IR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not everyone is delusional. Just most people in this business.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lgF1Iy"&gt;“Not everyone is delusional,” she added. “Just most people in this business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zigYR"&gt;That said, Toyota and Aurora weren’t delusional when they decided to buy the automated driving teams at Lyft and Uber, respectively. They likely saw the value in the code produced by those teams, as well as the talent accrued by the ride-hailing companies over the years. When you can’t hire the people you’d like to staff your own projects, then you have to acquihire them, the distinctive Silicon Valley practice of buying a smaller company for the express purpose of acquiring their team of software engineers. Also, Uber and Lyft were very motivated to sell as recently public companies under pressure to staunch the bleeding and become profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQsbWp"&gt;Another recent acquihire was when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;Apple bought bankrupt self-driving startup Drive.ai &lt;/a&gt;back in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/apple-lays-off-over-200-from-project-titan-autonomous-vehicle-group.html"&gt;Apple had just laid off over 200 engineers&lt;/a&gt; from its secretive Project Titan, its own floundering self-driving operation. The Drive.ai team, composed of several graduates from Stanford’s AI lab, had already had some modest success with a ride-hailing pilot in Texas. Unhappy with its own team, Apple simply fired them and bought a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0o4gx"&gt;“The buying up of these companies represents companies being able to buy skill sets that they would not otherwise be able to recruit,” Cummings said. “And I think that’s very valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bTJCt2"&gt;The recent reorganization of the self-driving car industry may also point to a new set of priorities. Namely, robotaxis are out, and logistics and industrial applications are in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqBxk0"&gt;Four years ago, the industry saw plenty of startups come out of stealth promising to do everything: they were going to make hardware &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;software; they were going to build their own vehicle; they were going to do robotaxis &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;delivery &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;trucking. And of course, they were going to change the world in the process. “It was a little bit like the decathlete business model,” said &lt;a href="https://reillybrennan.com/"&gt;Reilly Brennan&lt;/a&gt;, general partner at venture capital firm &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.vc/"&gt;Trucks&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re going to be very good at 10 different things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHHcnn"&gt;Now, most investors are interested in more “structured” applications of automated driving technology, such as construction, mining, middle-mile delivery, and agriculture. “So instead of being a decathlete, you had to pick a javelin thrower,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wkNGZ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“So instead of being a decathlete, you had to pick a javelin thrower”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WzrNJI"&gt;That’s not to say robotaxis are completely dead — far from it, with major players like Waymo, Cruise, Argo, and Baidu as well as smaller startups like Pony.ai, May Mobility, and Optimus Ride still banking on the proliferation of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles by the middle of this decade. But Brennan says the robotaxi craze has definitely cooled in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6595S6"&gt;“Frankly, we stopped seeing robotaxi startups in probably the end of 2017,” Brennan said. “Here we are in 2021 and there are very few ongoing robotaxi startups that aren’t, you know, Cruise, Waymo, or Argo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQSpoD"&gt;Brennan thinks the concept of autonomous vehicles that can drive anywhere under any conditions is still possible, but much further out than originally thought. They will require huge financial investments — “11 figures” by Brennan’s estimates — and a willingness to tolerate zero cash flow until the technology is mature and safe enough to launch. There are only so many companies with deep enough pockets to take on that challenge: major car companies like Ford, GM, and Volkswagen or tech giants like Apple, Alphabet, and Intel. Everyone else is probably not long for this world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SszjqN"&gt;The mid-level engineers always knew this to be true, Brennan said. It was the CEOs who were making the erroneous predictions about the availability of self-driving taxis by 2020. “I think the CEOs of those companies knew that they were going to be playing golf by 2020,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic needs to tarnish Apple’s App Store halo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_dbuH7j00UhHKuAGNbEG0UMwpE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249704/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D3Yc8Y"&gt;At the beginning of this week’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple described Epic’s lawsuit as an “assault” on the entire iOS philosophy. One of the iPhone and iPad’s defining features is a curated ecosystem (or, from a different perspective, a walled garden). A loss for Apple could require it to allow side-loaded apps and alternative app stores, potentially including Epic’s own Epic Games Store. Apple says that would damage the privacy and security that iOS is known for, making Apple spend more money to fix new problems that crop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qes3P"&gt;Epic spent the fourth day of trial offering its counter-narrative: the iOS App Store isn’t actually very good. Calling two Apple executives to the stand, Epic’s attorneys took jabs at everything from the update review process to Apple allegedly leaking Marshmello’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concert playlist. They pushed Apple to justify its claims about privacy and security by producing hard research demonstrating threats and breaches — which Apple largely didn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JAdN3U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic is making the case that the app store just isn’t very good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOrmnw"&gt;After a short examination of Epic’s online business strategy head Thomas Ko, Epic called on Matt Fischer, App Store vice president and the first witness employee from Apple. Epic’s attorney peppered Fischer with anecdotes from frustrated developers — calling the iOS in-app payment system a “joke,” the refund policies “awful,” the review process “arbitrary and unpredictable,” and the entire store “plagued with outdated, low-quality apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spju9Q"&gt;Apple’s App Store has some clear problems. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;my colleague Sean Hollister wrote last month&lt;/a&gt;, you can find ridiculous stories about iOS apps that appear to swindle users yet maintain unbelievably high review stories — and aren’t removed even months after a formal complaint. Eric Friedman, an Apple employee who is set to testify, has been quoted saying the app review team is “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog” or “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qssmJ"&gt;But Epic’s questioning today didn’t capture the kind of drama that implies. The attorneys spent much of their time trying to catch Apple executives in contradictions, and while they quoted disgruntled developers like the ones above, they rarely delved into the substance of their complaints. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers became audibly irritated with Epic repeatedly producing documents to establish a “state of mind” about the App Store rather than hard facts, since the files would be uploaded for public viewing. “Non-lawyers don’t understand the difference between something being admitted for its truth and being admitted for some other evidentiary purpose,” she told an attorney. Apple countered one negative review snippet simply by having Fischer read the line above it, where the writer said they were still giving the App Store a high rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YzD79T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qj6Fko"&gt;There’s one plausible reason Epic doesn’t have more specific stories: many developers are &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/google-and-apple-scare-us-app-makers-tell-congress.html"&gt;reportedly scared to criticize Apple&lt;/a&gt;. That’s been a running theme in congressional scrutiny of Apple, and Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store — even if developers try to return via Apple’s Safari browser, they’ll be denied access to things like push notifications and AR features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiaM2i"&gt;Epic also still has witnesses who could poke holes in Apple’s narrative. Friedman is scheduled to appear over the next two weeks, and so is an executive from Match Group, which spoke critically of Apple in front of Congress. Epic’s attorneys left a big question hanging about whether Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/apple-hulu-special-api-access/"&gt;offers special terms to some developers&lt;/a&gt; — something Fischer denied, but wasn’t heavily pressed on. In any case, this trial hinges on much more than the precise quality of Apple’s developer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP4keM"&gt;But today demonstrates the difficulty of discussing large-scale moderation without opening yourself up to charges of dealing in mere anecdotes. Judge Rogers made clear that she’s interested in whether Apple is better or worse than its alternatives, not simply whether it’s ever had problems. And while Epic can point to individual screwups, Apple will try to argue that it’s doing its best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvs9pg"&gt;“It’s a human process. We do make mistakes,” said Apple’s marketing manager Trystan Kosmynka, the day’s last witness. “But we certainly try to rectify those mistakes when we learn of them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is giving a laser company that builds some of its AR tech $410 million</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C0IJlY"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-awards-an-additional-410-million-from-its-advanced-manufacturing-fund-to-ii-vi%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F6%2F22423827%2Fapple-ii-vi-advanced-manufacturing-fund-award-ar-vr-faceid" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s awarding Pennsylvania-based optical technology company II-VI with $410 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple CEO  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1390378601690791938"&gt;Tim Cook tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s tech helps power Apple’s FaceID, Memoji, and Portrait Mode. The company also manufactures lasers that are used in the LIDAR scanner found in the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro, technology that Apple touts as being key to augmented reality experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGxtFF"&gt;Finisar, which was &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/09/finisar-acquisition-iivi-aapl-fnsr.html"&gt;later acquired by II-VI&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “two-six”) r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16771246/apple-finisar-iphone-laser-investment"&gt;eceived $390 million&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s fund back in 2017. While this latest investment likely shows that Apple intends to keep FaceID (which is powered by II-VI’s vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers) around for a while, it could also be another sign pointing to Apple’s future with AR and VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3seH3"&gt;Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;has publicly said&lt;/a&gt; that he believes AR is “critically important” to Apple’s future, and II-VI manufactures devices that help computers see the world in 3D. The money could help develop more advanced version of the technology already found on Apple devices, potentially for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;the rumored mixed reality headset&lt;/a&gt;. II-VI’s CEO says in Apple’s press release that the partnership with Apple “sets the stage for a new wave of breakthrough technologies that we believe will enable a wide range of applications that will benefit our world for decades to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuvtMT"&gt;The press release states that II-VI will use the funds to expand manufacturing capacity, create jobs, and “accelerate delivery of future components for iPhone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAHqVj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article had II-VI written as II-IV throughout. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nf4Oba"&gt;Apple made it more difficult to upgrade your Hulu subscription plan — say, to add live TV — after it realized the company was offering a way to automatically cancel subscriptions made through the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcwEra"&gt;According to new emails revealed as part of Apple’s lawsuit with Epic Games, the company had given Hulu access to its subscription API but didn’t realize Hulu was using it to help people switch to Hulu’s billing system (and avoid Apple’s in-app purchases) until 2018 when the feature was mentioned in a tweet that caught the eye of a higher-up at Apple. You can see the tweet embedded below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TARhnQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I didn’t realize App Store subscriptions could be automatically cancelled through the StoreKit API. I’m surprised I haven’t seen more offers to switch billing away from the App Store. &lt;a href="https://t.co/DcXzM2CCrq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DcXzM2CCrq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Barnard (@drbarnard) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drbarnard/status/1045733512140247042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SjpnxD"&gt;Hulu’s motivation for providing automatic cancellations should be clear. Why let Apple take a slice of every subscription and upgrade when you can keep more of it by directing a subscriber to your site and billing system? And why not make it even easier to do so by automatically canceling that pesky old subscription?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zN9zqC28zg-hReGS855VyGS27xc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496811/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_12.02.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt Fischer’s email to Cindy Lin about a certain Phil noticing the Hulu tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ak0ojZ"&gt;Apple has a problem with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYcAWb"&gt;The first email in the thread from Matt Fischer, VP of the App Store, to Cindy Lin, EPM of iTunes, sets the scene. Phil saw &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drbarnard/status/1045733512140247042"&gt;David Barnard’s tweet&lt;/a&gt; commenting on the unexpected feature and asked why Hulu would even be able to automatically cancel subscriptions in the first place. That Phil is likely Phil Schiller, the Apple fellow overseeing the App Store and someone both Fischer and Lin would want to have answers and results for quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGH4HtMMVE9OOR2qOEgnHxRiiVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496819/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_12.09.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cindy Lin’s explanation of how Hulu may have been able to automatically cancel subscriptions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="67BniL"&gt;In the thread, Lin went on to explain that back in 2015, Hulu had access to the subscription cancellation and refund APIs that may have allowed it to enable the feature. Apple originally gave the streaming service access so it could support instant upgrades to a “[two] family set up” before Apple had developed its own upgrade and downgrade feature for in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4QH8F"&gt;Pete Distad, an executive in charge of Apple’s video business, and Carson Oliver, director of App Store Business Management, were aware of some issue with Hulu’s subscriptions. Interestingly, Distad was an SVP of marketing and communications at Hulu before he joined Apple. That relationship may not have helped, though. Oliver ends his email by writing, “I think we need to take immediate steps to protect against further misuse of the API.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgqK0z"&gt;Hulu no longer has the ability to automatically cancel subscriptions and no longer offers in-app purchases. Upgrading your plan requires a trip to Hulu’s website or a phone call. Apple’s developer guidelines also now expressly forbid directing customers to subscribe in any way other than through in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOxsqblhjqo9rLQ3TxcO55ILFRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496850/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_12.32.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s developer policy for offering subscriptions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WamfUi"&gt;It’s sort of funny that Apple seems to have found out about what Hulu was doing through a tweet, but also, here’s yet another example of how Apple’s hold over the App Store has tightened over the years, and how its relationship has changed with some of the biggest businesses selling their wares on its store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeJYw9"&gt;In 2015, Apple was willing to take &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/13/8406229/apple-tv-15-percent-streaming-services"&gt;a smaller cut of its commission&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix and Hulu subscriptions if they were made through an Apple TV. But by 2018, it was considering taking action against the company to protect its control of in-app purchases. Some employees at Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;apparently considered other drastic measures&lt;/a&gt; to keep Netflix in line when it was kicking up dust about in-app purchases in that same year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ej4NJQ"&gt;Apple likely wants to keep video services using in-app purchases just as badly as the video services want to stop. Sometimes, they cut a deal — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"&gt;like the one Amazon received&lt;/a&gt;. Other times they use the available tools to their advantage... at least until Apple checks its Twitter feed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Night Shift is no match for the complexities of sleep</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone SE review" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4YsXlbTvH297UcURLpunyhACq40=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69247787/iphone-se-review-vpavic-verge-13.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kg7CIz"&gt;Apple’s Night Shift feature, which it says “may help you get a better night’s sleep,” doesn’t appear to live up to its claim, according to new research. Because exposure to blue light affects the regulation of sleep cycles, the hope is that Night Shift, which filters blue light from screens after sunset, will make falling asleep easier. But as a recent study shows, sleep is weird and complicated, and a single phone feature likely won’t do much to combat sleepless nights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcrQOk"&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Sleep Health&lt;/em&gt;, tracked the sleep of 167 young adults for one week. People were divided into three groups: one that used their phones for an hour before bed with Night Shift turned on, one that did the same with Night Shift turned off, and one that didn’t use their phones at all before bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dc3mqJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Night Shift is not superior to using your phone without Night Shift”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4l7NJN"&gt;“In the whole sample, there were no differences across the three groups,” said Chad Jensen, the lead researcher of the study, &lt;a href="https://news.byu.edu/intellect/is-night-shift-really-helping-you-sleep-better"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Night Shift is not superior to using your phone without Night Shift or even using no phone at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbPulA"&gt;This is only one small study that will need to be replicated at a larger scale with different samplings of people before it can be generalized. Still, the results for the Night Shift feature fall in line with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/29/11326194/apple-night-shift-blue-light-sleep"&gt;early skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about how much it can help sleeplessness, especially because Apple doesn’t specify which wavelengths of light are blocked. And while blue light and phone use do likely contribute to difficulty sleeping, there are many other variables to consider within the complexities of sleep and sleep hygiene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oycJ7Y"&gt;The researchers were mildly surprised that even the group of people who went phone-less before bed didn’t necessarily have better sleep on average. “Our hypothesis was that we would see better sleep without using the phone across the full sample,” Jensen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “so it was a bit surprising that we didn’t find that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BF9Hnl"&gt;Part of that result is likely due to the fact that most of the participants were college students who, according to the researchers, were already sleep-deprived. When people are already very sleepy, it doesn’t really matter if they’re on their phones before bed, says Jensen. “Because your need for sleep is so high at that stage that you fall asleep pretty readily no matter what you do before bed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSyvGX"&gt;One of the few phone-related differences that the study did observe actually had to do with how much sleep participants got. Of the people in the study who slept more than the roughly seven-hour average sleep time, the people who went phone-less slept better and didn’t wake up as often during the night compared to those who used their phones. But the people who slept less than the average showed no difference in any measures of sleep quality, regardless of whether they used a phone at bedtime or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="WEECh2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s not one thing that works for everyone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E4xLvL"&gt;If you are a generally well-rested person, Jensen lists myriad factors that could impact your sleep beyond your phone use: caffeine, exercise, the temperature of the room, the amount of light, the amount of noise, consistency of sleep schedules and bedtime routines, and using the bed for activities besides sleeping. And that’s all before we even consider various sleep disorders that can make people too sleepy or not sleepy enough, even if they strive for good sleep habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsJP5e"&gt;“Sleep is so individualized, there’s not one thing that works for everyone,” says Raj Dasgupta, a sleep medicine specialist at the University of Southern California. Some people are more sensitive to light and might find blue light filtering helpful, but it won’t be the singular fix that leads to better sleep for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4023t"&gt;As far as phones go, there are things to consider besides just blue light exposure, says Jensen. “All those other forms of stimulation that are not related to light are equally important.” If you’re reading a depressing article or laughing at TikToks at bedtime, that level of alertness and engagement will likely hinder your ability to fall asleep, and filtering blue light won’t offset that effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirTags have a hidden developer menu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12 and an AirTag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVPzQi3osLLB8rr10SVxtVnh3c0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246227/vpavic_4547_20210421_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p5mLXF"&gt;Apple’s new item-tracking AirTags have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt;, and they come with a surprise addition: a hidden menu in the Find My app that reveals some of the back-end data used by the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymdrEI"&gt;To uncover this menu, open up Apple’s Find My app, select one of your AirTags, then tap your name in the top left corner five times. And just like Dorothy clicking her heels together, you’ll be whisked away to a comforting world of, well, sliders and data. It’s not clear what all the information means, though some of the labels (like “device pitch”) are obvious enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzgAVG"&gt;The menu seems to be an accidental remnant of Apple’s development process, with the information presumably left over from an early beta version of the Find My app. Think of it like builders leaving architectural plans under the floorboards of a house they’re constructing. This is normal stuff, you just don’t usually see it (especially from Apple). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7Fb1OXOOrQ93BE4LM1fBa8o1Gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495868/apple_airtags_developer_menu.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can access the menu by tapping in your name five times. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IpZDmC"&gt;The menu itself was discovered by a self-described “frustrated” AirTags user on Reddit, who was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/n5vtle/frustration_lead_to_airtag_hidden_dev_mode"&gt;tapping around the app in annoyance&lt;/a&gt; when they uncovered the information. We were able to verify that the menu works with our own devices, as have plenty of people on Twitter, which is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robertrosenfeld/status/1390178011920535553"&gt;where we first saw&lt;/a&gt; this accidental Easter egg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGbPWb"&gt;Over on Reddit, one user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/n5vtle/frustration_lead_to_airtag_hidden_dev_mode/gx3xqnd?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that the bottom four sliders actually relate to the various colors your screen turns as you approach your AirTagged item. “A=% mixed with view; H=hue; S=saturation; V=value/brightness,” says Redditor pmarksen. “The top two sliders relate to camera blur, and brightness. Not sure what the middle ‘sum’ slider does yet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjS6hl"&gt;The “eco mode” label seems to refer to a battery-saving feature that deploys a smaller screen resolution (the Find My user interfaces includes an AR camera overlay that directs you to your item), while the “dots” options apparently refer to the number of dots that swarm on the screen as part of the animation that shows you approaching your target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVkxFq"&gt;If anyone else has any more hints, clues, or wild speculation about what else the screen shows, please feel free to drop by the comments below. We’ve pinged Apple to ask about this menu and expect to hear only embarrassed silence.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod and HomePod mini can now integrate with music streaming service Deezer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7Fh8ctVESXqYoMA1hXQE_RR3m4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245527/dseifert_201107_4281_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKd53X"&gt;Owners of Apple’s HomePod and HomePod mini can now connect their smart speakers directly to Deezer and make the music streaming service their default player. That means they can take advantage of the HomePod’s Siri voice controls to navigate their tunes and playlists on Deezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJnhri"&gt;To connect the services, you’ll first need to be a paying Deezer subscriber. If you are, head to the Deezer app on your iOS device (make sure you’re on iOS 14.3 or later), hit the settings cog in the top right, then scroll down and hit “Connect with HomePod.” You can then play music from Deezer on your Apple speakers by saying “Hey Siri, play [insert cool and relevant band of choice] on Deezer&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u5PDD0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s smart speakers now work directly with Deezer, but still no Spotify&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5oidUz"&gt;Alternatively,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you can make Deezer your default player from Apple’s Home app and avoid having to specify which streaming service to use. We weren’t able to test this ourselves, but it’s likely the same process as for other third-party streaming services. So go to Home Settings by hitting the house icon in the top left of Apple’s Home app, tap on your face under the “People” section,” then go to “Default Service” and choose Deezer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzwbri"&gt;Phew. Isn’t it fantastic when these services &lt;em&gt;just work&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AShI0p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple HomePod mini review: playing small ball","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="c3dlfx"&gt;Of course, the struggle to offer these sorts of basic, third-party integrations is exactly what’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker"&gt;hurt&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s smart speakers, likely contributing to the company’s decision to discontinue the original HomePod in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;March this year&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the reasonably-priced and good-sounding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt; still soldiers on. In addition to Deezer, these devices can now directly integrate with other streaming services including Apple Music, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and Pandora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuR9VH"&gt;What’s missing from this list, of course, is Spotify. Although Apple says it’s enabled integration with the music streaming giant, as far as we know Spotify hasn’t switched things on at its end. If you’re searching for an explanation, look no further than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;huge lawsuit Spotify is currently pursuing against Apple&lt;/a&gt;. As an alternative, you can use Spotify to play music on HomePod speakers, but you’ll need to connect via AirPlay, which is frustratingly slow and lacks voice controls — one of the big draws of using a smart speaker at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82dyym"&gt;But hey, that’s what you, the unlucky consumer, get for being stuck between two warring corporations. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to hide apps from your iPhone’s home screen using iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone games" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7MsKC4IL9WCnMxho9Z8yeE3GYPU=/0x0:3441x2294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245433/iphone-games-004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9tHJL"&gt;If you get annoyed with the number of apps that crowd your iPhone’s home screen, you probably welcomed a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21291695/apple-ios-14-updates-home-screen-redesign-features-release-date-wwdc-2020"&gt;came with iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;: the App Library, which gathers all of your apps into various categories and displays them on a separate page to the right of your home pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9dNBXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14’s App Library to organize your apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21443994/ios-14-app-library-iphone-organize-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pt9K1X"&gt;The App Library doesn’t only add some automatic organization to your iPhone’s home pages, but allows you to clean up your home screen by hiding as many apps as you want. You can keep your favorites front and center, and get the more utilitarian or less-used apps out of the way. (In fact, one way to keep a clean screen is to have all your newly-installed apps appear in your App Library only — we offer directions on how to do that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21443994/ios-14-app-library-iphone-organize-how-to"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQvLxm"&gt;If you want to organize your current apps by hiding some of them, there are several ways to do it. You can remove individual apps from the home screen, you can hide an entire screen of apps, or you can organize several apps by putting them into a folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwz9rr"&gt;Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vjeqk2"&gt;Hide a single app&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Long-press on an app and select “Remove App”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoswT8gw8DQFQzcLTVfk_jITo7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494263/IMG_6FDA0D8317B4_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on an app and select “Remove App”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Remove from Home Screen”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkFpNCzdZ1YD4yxdcVDXS2ZDXC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494261/IMG_0106.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Remove from Home Screen”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3fNxy"&gt;To hide individual apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dCkcpw"&gt;Press on your selected app until a menu appears. The menu will include a number of options, depending on the app’s features (for example, if I press on an app for Microsoft Teams, the menu will let me make a new call or start a chat). But you will always get an option (in red) to remove the app. Tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dYLK3y"&gt;You will now have the choice of deleting the app from the phone or removing it from the home screen. Select the latter. You’ll still find the app in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1tHXdP"&gt;If the app is not already in the App Library, then after you tap “Remove App,” you will instead be given the choice of either deleting the app or moving it to the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hNL7OI"&gt;Hide a page of apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long press the screen and tap the series of dots at the bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYpm-d8akSfLGxkJjGFbz-bQHe4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494282/IMG_70E40F5ECAB6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press the screen and tap the series of dots at the bottom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Uncheck the screen that you want to hide" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pldHVJRMw7Ti3jEUwGSO5odrScc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494275/IMG_8FD48CFB7F74_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncheck the screen that you want to hide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rALNn7"&gt;You can also hide an entire page of apps — and get rid of that page — at one blow if you want. And since it’s really easy to also restore that same page, it’s a great way to hide groups of apps that you only use occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v4tT06"&gt;Tap and hold on an empty part of your screen until the apps begin to jiggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XKAP6x"&gt;Tap on the dots at the bottom of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZQPXkm"&gt;You’ll now be able to see small versions of all your screens (except the App Library and Today View). Beneath each visible screen is a checkmark; uncheck any screen you want to hide and tap “Done” in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wXDkoH"&gt;To “unhide” any of the screens, follow these same directions and replace the checkmark of the screen that you want to see again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P0gvzg"&gt;Use folders to organize apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Move one app on top of another to create a gray folder" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIpIBK9-M5LOQWtd7jjCpYtCNps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494310/IMG_F1C450C97344_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move one app on top of another to create a gray folder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the folder to access the apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4GXqYO_GOuozrOkz0QtaYgPcgwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494266/IMG_0D571D5779F9_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the folder to access the apps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SK6n99"&gt;You can use folders on the home screen to gather similar apps together and save space. You won’t be completely hiding the apps — they’ll be there. But they’ll be consolidated in a single space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPxg35"&gt;It’s very simple to create a folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="626Ixd"&gt;Long-press on an app in the home screen until the icons jiggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dMfIlH"&gt;Move the app onto one of the other apps you want to group it with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ufgkAJ"&gt;You’ll now have a gray icon that contains the icons for the apps in the folder. Tap on the icon to open the folder and access the apps in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f6j7NI"&gt;iOS will assign a name to the folder depending on what apps you’ve put in it. To change the name, long-press on the folder, and select “Rename” from the pop-up menu. Then type in the new name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the folder to access the apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pq0N0qhP4_upKkheuMYVu92wt1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494270/IMG_0C514D9DDEC0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on the folder to rename or remove it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can rename it anything you like" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1skcDiJqHcDYYlA5oUP-CjpD8O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494272/IMG_B98F55477CAA_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can rename it anything you like&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Fcht3h"&gt;To remove an app from a folder, simply open the folder, long-press the app until it jiggles, and move it out of the folder and to another space on your home screen. If you remove all the apps from a folder, the folder will disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="el18TB"&gt;If you want to get rid of a folder, you can also long-press on it and select “Remove Folder.” Any apps that were in the folder can then be found in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UT4l6g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxDiB3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egtIJp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNNBa0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bwkyff"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the bad iPhone web app experience keeps coming up in Epic v. Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OIbeBrT5UyAXI-cns6znc8cu6Eo=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245096/xcloudiphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Safari just doesn’t support key features — and Safari’s the only option&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8gwpz8"&gt;Something keeps coming up at the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial as a potential alternative for getting &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on the iPhone: web apps. It’s an intriguing idea, as web apps are able to do surprisingly complex things: just look at a Chromebook or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;game streaming services on the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. But potential is far from reality, because the ability for web apps to look, feel, and perform as well as native apps on iOS is severely limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9Merj"&gt;These web apps aren’t the preferred way for consumers or developers to use or create apps on the iPhone, either. But Apple has forced companies like Microsoft and Nvidia to use web apps, instead of native ones available in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yylJtA"&gt;Though the term itself hasn’t really come up explicitly, what’s being discussed are Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs. If you’re unfamiliar, think of them as slightly more advanced web apps that you can “install” directly from your web browser onto your home screen. Google has been pushing the idea (though support for PWAs on its own platforms is a little mixed), and some companies like Microsoft and Twitter have wholeheartedly embraced PWAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUwtju"&gt;Not Apple, though. There are a variety of reasons for that — ranging from genuine concern about giving web pages too much access to device hardware to the simple fact that even Apple can’t do everything. There’s also the suspicion that Apple is deliberately dragging its feet on support for features that make PWAs better as a way to drive developers to its App Store instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRg3ygALY-Q38sy-_H2NB_ZyQDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10437351/fortniteiphonex.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt; running on an iPhone before its removal.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J19AAK"&gt;But the App Store has restrictions that aren’t tenable for some developers. That’s the whole crux of this trial for Epic, after all. On the stand, a Microsoft executive detailed the company’s struggles to get its xCloud game streaming service onto iOS. Lori Wright, VP of Xbox business development at Microsoft, revealed the company spent around four months talking to Apple to try and get xCloud launched as a native app. Apple seemed, initially, open to the idea of letting Microsoft use the same model as Netflix or Audible. But Apple changed its mind and forced Microsoft, Nvidia, and others to list cloud games as separate apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCMbLT"&gt;Submitting Xbox games one-by-one was simply a nonstarter for Microsoft, so it resorted to making a web app. In addition to the technical hurdles a web app involves, it also introduces a discoverability issue. Users simply aren’t used to installing apps from the web on their iPhones. Apple has effectively trained everybody that if they want an app, they go to the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0etUj"&gt;Wright essentially admitted that the only reason Microsoft is releasing Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) as a web app is because Apple’s terms on the App Store are too onerous. “People don’t play games through the browser on iPhone,” said Wright, but “it was our only outcome in order to reach mobile users on iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXkjIF"&gt;Even the judge in the case seemed confused by Apple’s rule, which says that services that stream movies can offer them all in a single app, but services that stream games have to separate each game for individual listing and review. “I can use Netflix with a native app and I can see lots of different movies or TV shows or whatever. Is it that you didn’t want to use a subscription model?” Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers asked at one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Uu-KLuKdNnlK8sa1T0vd91UANM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334298/microsoft_xcloud_e3_2019_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has forced Microsoft and others to head to the web for gaming streaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2sTjH"&gt;But back to those technical hurdles: they’re high, numerous, and can be blamed both on the nature of web apps and Apple’s own decisions. Safari on the iPhone only &lt;em&gt;recently&lt;/em&gt; became capable of supporting a service like Xbox Cloud Gaming via specific controller support. Until then, that sort of thing was on the list of features Apple was reticent to include in Safari. There are legitimate reasons to block things like Bluetooth access from web apps, including fingerprinting for tracking, but it was getting harder to justify and Apple needed some kind of escape valve as pressure mounted to support cloud gaming services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYerIx"&gt;Google software engineer Alex Russell recently &lt;a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/"&gt;published a very comprehensive list of all the features that Safari on iOS doesn’t support yet&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s a long list. For PWAs to truly be a viable alternative to App Store apps, there are at least a few of these features that need to be enabled. The inability to send push notifications via a web app, for example, is particularly galling as it’s already possible on Safari on macOS. An app that can’t send notifications is simply not competitive with an app that can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="gEm2RS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Grant is touching on some more of the benefits to native versus web apps; push notifications and ARKit both come up. The former is another example of Apple letting native apps reduce friction points — Epic needs to convince the judge these smaller features are meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390045337000284161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h9L1lz"&gt;As Russell notes, his “interests and biases are plain” as a Google engineer. But it doesn’t change the fact that there are many things that a PWA cannot do on the iPhone that a developer like Epic would need to support &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as a web app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EQVkX"&gt;“Native [iPhone] apps would have access to a far wider range of APIs than web apps,” explained Andrew Grant, engineering fellow at Epic Games, during the trial. “Access to things like push notifications, to Siri, to health data, and augmented reality features” are also limited to native apps, said Grant. Web apps also have to be far smaller than native apps, and are capped at about 50MB in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jl61s4"&gt;Plus, from a simple performance perspective, web apps have more overhead than native apps — and lack access to Apple APIs that can speed up games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0ncWG"&gt;In fact, this was a sticking point for a lot of the questioning of an Nvidia employee. Nvidia, like Microsoft, has been trying to get its GeForce Now cloud gaming service into the App Store, but has faced the same restrictions that Microsoft is struggling with. Nvidia director of product management Aashish Patel spent a lot of time answering questions around latency in a browser and the benefits of using native apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZgVIj"&gt;“There are less controls over the streaming, so you could argue in some ways it’s worse,” than a native app, said Patel. Developers are also locked into using the video codecs provided in Safari on iOS, whereas they could use alternatives that might be better at handling latency inside a native iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5THJwULmAlKJTxhxmhw3tU-Irjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19206401/akrales_190914_3666_0259.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All iOS browsers run the same WebKit engine underneath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KtWlda"&gt;All of this is compounded by yet another Apple policy: no third-party browser engines. You can install apps like Chrome, Firefox, Brave, DuckDuckGo, and others on the iPhone — but fundamentally they’re all just skins on top of Apple’s WebKit engine. That means that Apple’s decisions on what web features to support on Safari are final. If Apple were to find a way to be comfortable letting competing web browsers run their own browser engines, a lot of this tension would dissipate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEbgNQ"&gt;As it relates to &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, a lot of this PWA discussion isn’t germane to the fundamental arguments in the case. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as a PWA would necessarily be a streaming app instead of a native game, and that introduces an entirely different set of compromises. Which is why it’s so fascinating to see Apple’s lawyers float web apps as a potential solution — because web apps on the iPhone are famously more limited than they are on other platforms, including even Apple’s macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SC0v1r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The human-readable versus machine-readable code bit is back now — Grant is talking about how web apps don’t go through the same kind of compilation process that increases processing efficiency, yet another reason they’re not as good as native apps.&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390047726549749760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HcaeCs"&gt;Even if every single browser feature was available on mobile Safari or even if Apple allowed alternative browser engines on the iPhone, a web app will never match the performance of a native app. At the end of the day, though, all the discussion of web apps in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case highlights the limitations of Apple’s App Store policies, not of PWAs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internal emails reveal how badly Apple wanted to keep Netflix using in-app purchases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v4h4D6CLronvfEYrCk6F1XhPj8Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69244186/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kNJ4s1"&gt;Internal emails revealed during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; show that employees at Apple were considering giving Netflix special treatment to convince the streaming service to not abandon in-app purchases. In the run up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/28/18159373/netflix-in-app-subscriptions-iphone-ipad-ios-apple"&gt;Netflix removing its subscription offering&lt;/a&gt; to avoid Apple’s fees, a presentation circulated within Apple proposed to advertise Netflix in its retail stores, use a portion of its cut of App Store commission fees to pay for search ads, and even bundle Netflix with other Apple services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wkdav4"&gt;The emails, spotted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/05/netflix-apple-in-app-purchase/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, start with an explanation of a test Netflix wanted to run to study the impact of disabling in-app purchases on iOS. Netflix’s main concern, as Director of App Store Business Management Carson Oliver wrote, was over the “voluntary churn” of subscribers through the App Store. The exact amounts are redacted, but that seems to suggest that Netflix subscribers from the App Store cancelled the service more than subscribers who joined other ways, like through Netflix’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ch-v_51dkLOdt7otKzrq0A5XTas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494902/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_5.55.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carson Oliver’s summary of Netflix’s in-app purchase test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Eaa8G1"&gt;Since Apple takes a 30 percent cut from subscription fees as part of its App Store policy, there’s also clear financial reasons why Netflix might want to consider not using IAPs. Netflix could keep more of each monthly subscription without Apple’s cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2aLBc"&gt;In Apple’s first internal responses to Netflix’s plans, Oliver asks whether the company should consider punishing Netflix if it went forward with its test. There’s a several-month gap between the initial thread of emails and Apple’s later Netflix discussions, but the tone seems to have changed once Netflix appeared committed to A/B testing the removal of in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2GqYV"&gt;An email from July of 2018 showed Apple employees had created a presentation in favor of in-app purchases. It included reminders of the things Apple has done for Netflix and floated new deals, like offering subscriber discounts (Apple would eventually&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419634/apple-app-store-subscription-offer-codes-ios-ipados-14"&gt; launch something like that in 2020&lt;/a&gt;) and letting Netflix determine what Netflix shows and movies Apple writes about it in the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uL3cMR"&gt;Apple also highlighted all of the promotion it did for Netflix in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15741096/apple-app-store-games-redesign-announcement-wwdc-2017"&gt;editorial section of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Apple also calls out that Netflix was featured more than any partner, and content written about the streaming service’s shows had boosted its downloads by six to seven percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmhnXm"&gt;But in the same presentation, Apple considered floating even more benefits to Netflix, some of which went beyond what the company has publicly offered other developers — though in the email it was stressed that “the ‘What we could do’ section is inclusive of pie in the sky ideas for completeness, and these ideas have not yet been approved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7naa4R"&gt;The presentation included email campaigns devoted to promoting just the Netflix app, carving out a portion of subscription fees for advertising in the App Store, and the possibility of bundling Netflix with Apple’s other services, well before Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20850842/apple-tv-plus-release-date-price-shows-oprah-streaming"&gt;Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt; or its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541685/apple-one-subscription-individual-family-premier-music-tv-plus-arcade-icloud-news-fitness"&gt;Apple One bundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3J89oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10485382"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I2F2Cw"&gt;Whatever discussion between the companies did eventually happen, in-app purchases were still removed from Netflix’s app and the company doesn’t seem to have been hurt by it in the longterm — Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;reached over 200 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P20zlS"&gt;What this whole email saga is illustrative of is how Apple’s policies for developers seem to have exceptions. The details aren’t fully explained in the presentation, but Apple does bring up offering “video partner program benefits” to Netflix, which sound similar to the deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;it cut with Amazon for Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;. The emails could serve as evidence that for lucrative and powerful partners, Apple seems to be willing to make concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
