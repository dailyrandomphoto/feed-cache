    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZMern"&gt;Apple Music is pushing more extensively into classical music. Today, Apple announced that it has acquired &lt;a href="https://www.primephonic.com/"&gt;Primephonic&lt;/a&gt;, a service that specializes in streaming the classical genre, and will incorporate the app’s functionality and playlists into Apple Music. The result will be “a significantly improved classical music experience,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-acquires-classical-music-streaming-service-primephonic%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648604%2Fapple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-streaming-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be a standalone Apple Music classical app coming sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBTHxN"&gt;Effective immediately, Primephonic is no longer accepting new customers, and the service as it exists today will shut down on September 7th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X85KIJ"&gt;Apple says Primephonic’s playlists and “exclusive audio content” will be first to be integrated into Apple Music. Down the line, it’ll add “the best features of Primephonic, including better browsing and search capabilities by composer and by repertoire, detailed displays of classical music metadata, plus new features and benefits.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn9ZSb"&gt;In a show of how serious Apple is about appealing to classical fans, the company says “a dedicated classical music app” will launch next year that will use Primephonic’s “classical user interface that fans have grown to love.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZrAiO"&gt;Primephonic launched three years ago, and its team says this deal is about scale and reaching more listeners. “As a classical-only startup, we can not reach the majority of global classical listeners, especially those that listen to many other music genres as well,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.primephonic.com/"&gt;a note on its webpage&lt;/a&gt;. “We therefore concluded that in order to achieve our mission, we need to partner with a leading streaming service that encompasses all music genres and also shares our love for classical music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JPDEw"&gt;According to Primephonic’s FAQ, customers with an active subscription will receive a prorated refund. They’ll also be getting a code to redeem six free months of Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfbxSn"&gt;As I wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;my early review of Apple Music’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, classical lends itself extremely well to Dolby Atmos mixes — so I’m looking forward to the service evolving into a better home for the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple cares about privacy, unless you work at Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_vkm8vk7K3TJmJbPOjZRKE5RhsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793705/acastro_210828_4732_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company has taken a strong stance on safeguarding its customers’ data — but some employees don’t believe it protects theirs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="i72298"&gt;Jacob Preston was sitting down with his manager during his first week at Apple when he was told, with little fanfare, that he needed to link his personal Apple ID and work account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a66Mno"&gt;The request struck him as odd. Like anyone who owns an Apple product, Preston’s Apple ID was intimately tied to his personal data — it connected his devices to the company’s various services, including his iCloud backups. How could he be sure his personal messages and documents wouldn’t land on his work laptop? Still, he was too giddy about his new job as a firmware engineer to care. He went ahead and linked the accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7C692k"&gt;Three years later, when Preston handed in his resignation, the choice came back to haunt him. His manager told him to return his work laptop, and — per Apple protocol — said he shouldn’t wipe the computer’s hard drive. His initial worry had come to pass: his personal messages were on this work laptop, as were private documents concerning his taxes and a recent home loan. Preston pushed back, saying some of the files contained highly personal information and there was no reasonable way to make sure they were all removed from the laptop without wiping it completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JTFGIN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If they did this to a customer, people would lose their goddamn minds.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DHpRb1"&gt;He was told the policy wasn’t negotiable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8jpj8"&gt;Preston’s story is part of a growing tension inside Apple, where some employees say the company isn’t doing enough to protect their personal privacy and, at times, actively seeks to invade it for security reasons. Employees have been asked to install software builds on their phones to test out new features prior to launch — only to find the builds expose their personal messages. Others have found that when testing new products like Apple’s Face ID, images are recorded every time they open their phones. “If they did this to a customer, people would lose their goddamn minds,” says Ashley Gjøvik, a senior engineering program manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fATl5U"&gt;Apple employees also can’t use their work email addresses to sign up for iCloud accounts, so many use their personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rw557J"&gt;The blurring of personal and work accounts has resulted in some unusual situations, including Gjøvik allegedly being forced to hand compromising photos of herself to Apple lawyers when her team became involved in an unrelated legal dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5fNLD"&gt;Underpinning all of this is a stringent employment agreement that gives Apple the right to conduct extensive employee surveillance, including “physical, video, or electronic surveillance” as well as the ability to “search your workspace such as file cabinets, desks, and offices (even if locked), review phone records, or search any non-Apple property (such as backpacks, purses) on company premises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGA1QT"&gt;Apple also tells employees that they should have “no expectation of privacy when using &lt;em&gt;your or someone else’s personal devices for Apple business&lt;/em&gt;, when using Apple systems or networks, or when on Apple premises” (emphasis added). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXwTkm"&gt;Many employees have a choice between getting an Apple-owned phone or having the company pay for their phone plan. But one source tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that trying to maintain two phones can become impractical. In software engineering, certain employees are expected to download a “live-on” program that puts out daily builds with bug fixes. “You can’t have a successful live-on program without people treating these devices exactly the same as a personal phone,” the source says. “So a work device or a work account just won’t cut it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OHPENx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You must link your personal Apple ID with your AppleConnect work account”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gcIeVu"&gt;None of these policies are unique. Tech companies almost always have rules in place to search employees’ corporate devices, including personal devices used for work. It’s also common practice for tech companies to ask employees to test new software, which could potentially expose personal information. But Apple sets itself apart from other tech giants through its commitment to consumer privacy. As &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-initiative"&gt;Tim Cook said at the CPDP Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in January 2021&lt;/a&gt;, businesses built on buying and selling user data, without the knowledge or consent of consumers, “[degrade] our fundamental right to privacy first, and our social fabric by consequence.” The lack of employee privacy has made the perceived hypocrisy particularly irksome to some workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAgJJd"&gt;Now, as employees begin to push back against a variety of Apple norms and rules, these policies are coming under the spotlight, raising the question of whether the company has done enough to safeguard personal employee data. It might seem like a company obsessed with secrecy would be sympathetic to its employees’ wishes to have confidential information of their own. But at Apple, secrecy requires the opposite: extensive knowledge, and control, over its workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="W0EPAn"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fX9LEK"&gt;This is how it starts: a new Apple employee is told during onboarding that collaborating with their colleagues will require them to make extensive use of iCloud storage, and their manager offers a two terabyte upgrade. This will link their personal Apple ID to their work account — in fact, the instructions for accessing this upgrade explicitly say “you must link your personal Apple ID with your AppleConnect work account.” The connection will give them access to collaborative apps like Pages and Numbers that they might need to do their jobs. (Apple employees who do not have a business need to collaborate do not go through this process.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sL0ABq"&gt;Employees &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; pause during onboarding and say they want to create a new Apple ID specifically for work or use a different phone. But most do not — it seems a little paranoid, and the Apple instructions say to go ahead and use your personal account. What’s more, most Apple devices don’t support using multiple Apple IDs. To switch between iCloud accounts on an iPhone, you have to completely sign out of one ID and into another — a clunky, disruptive process. It is far easier culturally and technically to simply link personal and work accounts, which adds a new Apple Work folder to the employee’s iCloud account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CYWXBP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I get mad that I have to use my personal phone to text my boss.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rsRVfM"&gt;In theory, this Apple Work folder is where all of the collaborative documents for employees are supposed to live in order to keep personal and work files separate. In practice, the owner of a document often forgets to store files in the work folder, and documents quickly become intermingled. In fact, when Apple employees create a document in, say, Pages, the app automatically enters the personal email address used for their Apple ID. “I asked my manager about it and it’s just sort of an issue everyone deals with,” Preston says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ9yZ8"&gt;Employees can choose to not sync certain folders, like their photo libraries. But others, like messages, can be trickier. Apple adopted Slack in 2019, but some teams still use iMessage as a primary way to communicate, which makes opting out of a message sync nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cND06r"&gt;Over the past few weeks, employees have been discussing the difficulty of setting up different Apple IDs to keep work and personal files separate, noting that while it’s possible, there are significant technical hurdles. “I don’t understand why they didn’t create an Apple ID and iCloud account from our work email address during the onboarding process,” one employee said on Slack. “I get mad that I have to use my personal phone to text my boss,” said another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Gb5oHV"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KX6B7I"&gt;Concerns about data privacy are not ubiquitous inside Apple. Many employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they were aware the company gave itself extensive rights to search their data, but — for various reasons — weren’t overly worried about the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HS4l18"&gt;“When I joined Apple, I personally expected it to be pretty invasive and took some serious steps to separate my work and personal life,” one source says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uvat9x"&gt;For other employees, however, the mixing of personal and work data has already had real consequences. In 2018, the engineering team Ashley Gjøvik worked on was involved in a lawsuit. The case had nothing to do with Gjøvik personally, but because she’d worked on a project related to the litigation, Apple lawyers needed to collect documents from her phone and work computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qMBbDh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All data that has your face in it is good data.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjR32s"&gt;Gjøvik asked the lawyers to confirm that they wouldn’t need to access her personal messages. She says her team discouraged the use of two phones; she used the same one for work and personal and, as a result, had private messages on her work device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWh2Gt"&gt;A member of the legal team responded that while the lawyers did not need to access Gjøvik’s photos, they did not want her to delete any messages. During an in-person meeting, Gjøvik says she told the lawyers the messages included nude photos she’d sent to a man she was dating — a sushi chef who lived in Hawaii. Surely, those weren’t relevant to the lawsuit. Could she delete them? She says the lawyers told her no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="n70Td0"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JxFw4s"&gt;In 2017, Apple rolled out an app called Gobbler that would allow employees to test Face ID before it became available to customers. The process was routine — Apple often launched new features or apps on employees’ phones, then collected data on how the technology was used to make sure it was ready for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwqUgC"&gt;Gobbler was unique in that it was designed to test face unlock for iPhones and iPads. This meant that every time an employee picked up their phone, the device recorded a short video — hopefully of their face. They could then file “problem reports” on Radar, Apple’s bug tracking system, and include the videos if they found a glitch in the system. “All data that has your face in it is good data,” said an internal email about the project. After rumors of criticism,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple eventually changed the codename to “Glimmer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pGlrWf"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Zoe Apple Feature|103688" data-volume-uuid="580d2e156" data-volume-id="103688" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-325" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jV2FDY"&gt;Unlike other Apple features, Glimmer wasn’t automatically installed on employee phones. It required an informed consent form so employees would know what they were getting into. Still, for some people on engineering teams, participation was encouraged — even expected, according to two staff members. Once it was installed, some data that didn’t contain personally identifiable information would automatically upload to Radar, unless employees turned off this setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Pznio"&gt;Apple was careful to instruct employees not to upload anything sensitive, confidential, or private. But it didn’t tell people what was happening with the hundreds of images they didn’t upload in Radar reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMLdGA"&gt;The reports themselves were also a cause for concern. When employees file Radar tickets, they include detailed information about the problems they are seeing. In 2019, Gjøvik filed a ticket about Apple’s photo search capabilities. “If I search for ‘infant’ in my photo library, it returns a selfie I took of myself in bed after laparoscopic surgery to treat my endometriosis,” she wrote, including four images in the ticket. The default sharing settings for the ticket included all of software engineering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o3fzws"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re the one tech company that takes privacy seriously.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gprojb"&gt;Radar tickets also are not removable. Even when the tickets are closed, they remain searchable. In training, employees say they are told: “Radar is forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFxerl"&gt;What’s more, when employees file Radar tickets, they are often asked to include diagnostic files, internally called “sysdiagnose” to give Apple more information about the problem. If they are filing a bug about iMessage, they might be asked to install a sysdiagnose profile that exposes their iMessages to the team tasked with fixing the issue. For employees using a live-on device, default settings can mean that, as they are filing a Radar ticket, a sysdiagnose profile is being automatically created in the background, sending data to Apple without the employee realizing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjiYsZ"&gt;When sysdiagnose profiles are not included, employees have been known to post memes calling out the omission. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/On4EnZwfGWeTJIUzgvtp5knMPOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814656/IMG_3D14F61845E9_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="apGDlX"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="g3Kohu"&gt;Gjøvik is currently on administrative leave from Apple due to an ongoing investigation into claims she made about harassment and a hostile work environment. If she leaves the company, she’ll likely face the same conundrum as Jacob Preston, related to the mixing of her personal and work files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ujrz0L"&gt;Employees likely wouldn’t care too much about this were it not for another Apple rule that bars them from wiping their devices when they leave the company. If they do, they’ll be in direct violation of their employment agreement, leaving them vulnerable to legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG6d7p"&gt;After Preston gave notice, he received a checklist from his manager that explicitly said: “Do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; wipe or factory reset any Apple owned units (such as laptops, Mac, ipads, and iPhones).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1N0xn"&gt;“Before joining Apple I had a lot of respect for the company,” Preston says. “They’re the one tech company that takes privacy seriously. But then they go and have these policies that are hypocritical and go against their stated values. It’s sort of hard to reconcile. It’s like now that I’m leaving, my privacy isn’t a concern anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6Tj11j"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 reportedly has flat sides and bigger screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3FJ6kTRJM7msaX0SC0af6SVElI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69791607/vpavic_200929_4216_0128.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eE2i2p"&gt;The upcoming Apple Watch will feature its first new hardware design in years, according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman’s &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter. Gurman says the Apple Watch Series 7 will have “a flatter display and edges,” seemingly continuing Apple’s quest to flatten the sides of every product in its lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pmZVT"&gt;The display is said to be slightly larger than the current panels found in the Series 6, and the cases’ sizes will also be a little bigger than before, with each model getting a 1mm bump to 41mm and 45mm. Unverified leaked images last week suggested the same &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1430866547787149315"&gt;41mm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1430698847450189824"&gt;45mm&lt;/a&gt; sizing. Gurman says Apple will include multiple new watch faces to make the most of the extra screen real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgOepv"&gt;Physical appearance aside, the Series 7 will also have a faster processor, according to Gurman. However, there reportedly won’t be any major health-focused upgrades this year, though Apple “may” include a body-temperature sensor in next year’s model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WVxDPW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 6 review: minute improvements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WGSRhu"&gt;An updated design for the Series 7 would continue an every-three-years cadence for major Apple Watch hardware refreshes. The first and last time Apple changed the case design of the Apple Watch was the Series 4; that basic appearance has remained unchanged through the Series 6, save the introduction of new materials and finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7ZLo0"&gt;Apple usually announces new watches in September, so a reveal for the Series 7 may not be far off. Last year the Series 6 and SE watches were a headline announcement at Apple’s September event, since the iPhone 12 unveiling was pushed back to October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 could have satellite connectivity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S3VPiN8oube9tQWoXUnhGVXMq0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69790682/acastro_190530_1777_wwdc_2019_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Kjyga"&gt;Finally a fun iPhone 13 rumor! If Apple holds to its traditional schedule we’re mere weeks away from a new iPhone, and until now the rumors have been slight and, dare I say boring. Yet noted Apple prognosticator and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is now claiming the iPhone 13 could have the ability to make satellite calls built right in, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/29/iphone-13-to-feature-leo-to-make-calls-and-text/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j35M46"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The X60 would likely be supporting another element of 5G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ErnFaS"&gt;In a note to investors, Kuo claims that the iPhone 13 will be able to connect directly to low earth orbit (or LEO) satellites thanks to a customized Qualcomm X60 baseband chip. LEO satellites are probably best known as the backbone of Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service which relies on satellites in a lower orbit to beam internet down to customers and avoid some of the common pitfalls of satellite internet, including high latency, and common blackouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFD2U2"&gt;But Starlink isn’t the only company using LEO satellites for connectivity. Hughesnet and OneWeb have combined forces to roll out a competitor to Starlink and &lt;a href="https://www.inmarsat.com/en/about/technology/orchestra.html"&gt;Immarsat announced a new constellation&lt;/a&gt; intended to blend with terrestrial 5G networks for a more global solution. More crucial for this iPhone rumor is Globalstar, which &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/globalstar-stock-price-qualcomm-iot-devices-5g-modem-satellite-technology-2021-2"&gt;saw its stock skyrocket&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year when Qualcomm announced its upcoming X65 chip would support Globalstar’s Band n53 tech. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-businesswire/da8bf860a2be436c8ce7b886c8dd3d67"&gt;3GPP had previously approved Band n53 as a 5G band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ELbxsr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Everything you need to know about 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="v2Tuej"&gt;If this rumor is true the X60 would likely be supporting another element of 5G, which is currently comprised of a whole mix of technologies, including the ultrafast but limited range millimeter-wave and the more widespread, but slower C-Band. LEO 5G would provide support in places that don’t yet have towers beaming down the other forms of 5G speed—particularly useful in many rural areas that often struggle to get 3G or 4G connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txbaUQ"&gt;What that means for battery life remains to be seen. There’s also the tree factor. Hopefully, the X60 chip in the iPhone 13 won’t be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;as susceptible to arboreal interference&lt;/a&gt; as a Starlink’s Dishy McFlatface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46wKlU"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MagSafe charger and the latest GoPro highlight this weekend’s best deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3CK8E198tvDEWPA5BaR5GVKhuJ4=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69787554/akrales_201018_4238_0464.0.12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MagSafe makes for a convenient charger around the house&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pdpAZu"&gt;The ecosystem of MagSafe chargers for the iPhone 12 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;might not be very expansive&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s hard to go wrong with Apple’s base magnetic wireless charger — especially when it’s discounted to $30 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The magnetic puck can provide the iPhone 12 Mini with up to 12 watts of power or the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro with up to 15 watts, so long as you use a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20-watt power brick&lt;/a&gt;. It can also top off other iPhones that support wireless charging without magnets. In fact, it can power up any device that supports Qi charging, including AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D0rzh1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10676303"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3GEdaz"&gt;It’s not too late to seek out some fun and adventure before the summer winds down, and this GoPro deal could help you document it. The GoPro Hero 9 Black is a rugged little action cam capable of capturing 5K video and 23.6-megapixel photos. It’s versatile enough to record underwater footage or capture a timelapse sequence, and portable enough to be worn or placed into any situation for a unique perspective. The GoPro Hero 9 Black is on sale from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DK5ZH44?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $350 — its best price ever — saving you $50 and (hopefully) helping motivate you to live a more exciting life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eTOlFB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10332746"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7QUlF5"&gt;School is about to be in full swing, and if you’re looking to pick up one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops available&lt;/a&gt;, the M1-equipped MacBook Air should be at the top of your list. Apple’s new chip makes for lightning-fast performance, which is further buoyed by great battery life, a revised scissor-switch keyboard, and the ability to run iPhone and iPad apps natively. The only thing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21559478/apple-m1-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-design-same-chip-transition-hardware"&gt;hasn’t really changed&lt;/a&gt; since its Intel-based predecessor is the laptop’s iconic, wedge-shaped design, which, given the excellent build quality, isn’t necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p1F4X"&gt;Although the 2020 MacBook Air recently dropped to as low as $850, it’s back up to its typical sale price of $899 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5KWB9H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604825-REG%2Fapple_mgn63ll_a_13_3_macbook_air_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22644815%2Fapple-magsafe-charger-gopro-hero-9-black-action-cam-m1-macbook-air-xbox-controller-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, now its second-best price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="88Zl6D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="asazSb"&gt;If there ever was an Xbox controller that took a cue from the abstract expressionist movement of the late 1940s, the &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; Limited Edition Xbox Wireless Controller would be it. The forthcoming Xbox Series X / S controller — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639740/xbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller"&gt;revealed during the Gamescom&lt;/a&gt; 2021 Xbox stream — is more vibrant than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607786/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-aqua-shift-special-edition-blue-rubber-side-grips"&gt;recently-announced Aqua Shift controller&lt;/a&gt; for the Xbox Series X / S, with a translucent-yellow build, splashes of color, and joysticks designed to match the aesthetic. It also comes with some exclusive &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;DLC, though it won’t arrive until the game launches on November 9th. Normally $75, you can &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-Forza-Horizon-5-Limited-Edition-for-Xbox-Series-X-S-Xbox-One-and-Windows-10-PCs%2F168090079" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder now for $6 off at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0xTpFU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10722273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This matches the lowest price we’ve seen on the midrange device, which remains an excellent phone that has yet to see a replacement.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The App Store is too big to change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufI18ykJAB9-tAqCIK2pLV2KwXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69787458/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVSgM1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;Apple made waves this week&lt;/a&gt; by announcing a $100 million settlement with small app developers who sued the company. But despite the changes announced yesterday, nothing is really changing for developers — the App Store is too big and too reliant on in-app purchase fees for that to happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuyIpb"&gt;Apple’s settlement &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22645070%2Fapple-app-store-policies-purchases-cut-fees-change-class-action" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;includes several new policies&lt;/a&gt; that it says “clarif[y]” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;the App Store’s rules&lt;/a&gt;. Developers can now contact customers about alternative payment methods using data collected from their app (so long as the notification itself is done outside their apps), which they had previously been barred from doing. Apple promises to keep the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces Apple’s revenue cut down to 15 percent for developers who make less than $1 million a year, in its current state for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PQim7S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s $100 million settlement agreement changes a key App Store rule for developers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u3QmCZ"&gt;The same goes for organizing its search results by “objective characteristics” like downloads, star ratings, and text relevance. Developers can set new price points for apps, and Apple promises to give them more information about how appeals work. It also plans to publish an annual transparency report about the App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSGOpw"&gt;But none of this is likely to make much of a difference in the long run to how the App Store actually works, or how the developers who make most of its money work with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XMtMd"&gt;This settlement gives concessions to small businesses on the App Store, but a handful of huge companies make most of the money on the App Store itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8F86jh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An estimated 98 percent of App Store developers are considered “small businesses”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ud2urf"&gt;While Apple itself didn’t give any numbers on how many of its developers fall into the “small app” category of making less than $1 million, a SensorTower report from late last year claimed that roughly 98 percent of all App Store developers qualify for the program. That report also noted that those developers — which Apple calls the “vast majority” of iOS app developers — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;only account for 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the App Store’s total revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slglWg"&gt;The economics of the App Store in 2021 are rules set by one multitrillion-dollar company to capture revenue from in-app transactions on the 2 percent of developers that account for 95 percent of commerce on Apple’s platforms. And all these rules and regulations and settlements and clarifications are to mollify the vast majority of developers who are effectively just bystanders caught in that larger crossfire. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJRKx8TEuwF2n_56VKmkMbwIgzw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689244/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gw1be"&gt;So what does Apple care if it has to give up $100 million here (the payout from its latest class action suit) or $59 million there (the estimated yearly cost to Apple of the Small App Business program)? As long as it’s able to defend the 30 percent cut of purchases that flow through its store from the bigger developers and apps, it can give whatever concessions it needs to on things like search rankings or new price points for apps to settle class action suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BSTlV"&gt;Apple’s biggest change, the option to discuss alternate payment methods, also has a hidden edge. Developers are now allowed to discuss alternative payment methods for subscriptions or services outside of their app using contact information obtained in the app — for example, they can now offer a form to submit an email address to sign up for deals to be sent to your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRvlLw"&gt;But if you want to actually sell something &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;your app, you still have to use Apple’s payment methods (and pay Apple’s cut), something that’s still a major point of contention for a lot of developers. And as last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;dramatic fight between Apple and Hey&lt;/a&gt; showed, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;not always easy to bypass Apple’s payments&lt;/a&gt; even if you are willing to jump through Apple’s hoops and only sign up users outside the app, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KBkyOQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The App Store runs on subscription and in-app purchases from a relatively small number of developers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTPQC5"&gt;The simple fact is that the App Store is a massive business for Apple at this point, and in 2021, the business of the App Store &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases and subscriptions. Consider the top-grossing apps offered on Apple’s store. &lt;a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/apps/ios/top/"&gt;App Annie’s list&lt;/a&gt; of 50 top grossing is absent any paid apps; &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/rankings/top/iphone/us/all-categories?date=2021-08-27"&gt;SensorTower’s list of 200&lt;/a&gt; includes just one, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; (at 109th place as of publication time, and as a game that notably also features in-app purchases). The biggest moneymakers on the platform — and therefore, the biggest moneymakers for Apple — are all free-to-play games, streaming services, and subscription-based apps that rely on customers buying and subscribing through Apple’s payments processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DWeDc"&gt;With the amount of money at stake here, Apple was never going to make it possible (or even easier) for developers to alert users to alternative payment methods within their apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYBcNg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;App Store was estimated&lt;/a&gt; to bring around $64 billion in sales in 2020. Factoring in the company’s 30 percent cut, that works out to roughly $19 billion in revenue for Apple. Though the actual number is likely slightly smaller, given that Apple offers reduced 15 percent cuts for things like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;for subscriptions after a year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvPAHh"&gt;But at the end of the day, Apple was never going to budge. The App Store is too big and too important to the company, and the way the App Store works in 2021 means that — unless a court decides otherwise, as Epic, Spotify, and others are actively trying to do — nothing will really change for the core parts of the app economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkmXD1"&gt;And that, of course, is something that Apple’s clarifications won’t interfere with at all. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oX86cP"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-service-program-for-no-sound-issues#ntf"&gt;announced a service program&lt;/a&gt; to fix failing receivers on iPhone 12 and 12 Pros (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/27/apple-launches-new-iphone-12-service-program-for-no-sound-issues/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company says that non-Mini or Max phones made between October 2020 and April 2021 may have an issue where no sound comes out of the earpiece when making or receiving calls, and that it’ll fix the issue for free as part of the new program. According to Apple, the problem is caused by a component in the receiver module failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o14osJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-service-program-for-no-sound-issues#ntf"&gt;Apple’s page&lt;/a&gt; says that only a “very small percentage” of devices may be affected. While it can be hard to tell what Apple means by “small percentage” (it &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks"&gt;infamously used the phrase&lt;/a&gt; when describing the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;butterfly keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that experienced issues), it doesn’t appear that the earpiece issue is widespread — searching for reports of failing receivers on Reddit or Twitter only turned up a few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9OQk3M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The issue covered doesn’t seem widespread&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xAPIFk"&gt;Still, for those with these phones, it’s nice to know that if your earpiece starts to go you’ll have some recourse. While all iPhone 12s are still under Apple’s one year warranty, the service program covers devices for two years after purchase, giving your earpiece an extra year of coverage. There is one thing to note if you’ve got this problem and are looking to send your phone in, though: Apple says that if your screen is cracked, it’ll have to be fixed before it’ll carry out the receiver repair. While the earpiece fix won’t cost you anything, the screen damage repair could, so just be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBPwF3"&gt;Apple also says that phones “will be examined prior to any service” to make sure they’re eligible for the program. This likely means that you won’t be getting a free fix if you’re like me and broke your phone’s receiver by accidentally spilling boiling hot pickling liquid into it. C’est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How small developers compete with the defaults on your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ap6-Q_uvxQHrLLrBzjjiyRDvqeE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69782731/VRG_ILLO_4687_Indie_App_Devs.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There are built-in calculator, camera, and to-do apps — but small devs can make them better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="U3ptjf"&gt;James Thomson started developing PCalc in 1992 as a way to learn to program for the Mac. Since then, he’s rewritten the calculator app multiple times to feature new UI changes, ported it to the iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, and maintained it for the Mac over the decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22VzVl"&gt;But PCalc’s popularity — let alone financial success — is an unlikely one. After all, Thomson doesn’t just have to sell customers on the idea of &lt;em&gt;paying&lt;/em&gt; for a calculator app; he has to convince them to spend $10 on his app in a world where Apple already offers its preloaded Calculator app for free on every iPhone and Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uz0V92"&gt;Apple bundles each iPhone with over 35 applications, spanning web browsing, email, weather, clock, calendar, camera, music, and virtually every other major part of the phone. It also has a huge home-field advantage for most of its apps, setting them as the default, with no way to change to any other option (something that the company is currently dealing with in a number of antitrust cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSoyYL"&gt;That leaves developers like Thomson in a tough spot, forced to simultaneously work with Apple to be distributed through its App Store, while still trying to outdo Apple’s own default apps with smaller — sometimes even one-person — teams. And yet, despite those challenges, many alternative apps have not only survived, but thrived in the cutthroat world of the App Store. The key is standing out: creating a better, richer experience than the more pared-down default apps provide, by offering apps with more advanced, unique, or different features than Apple’s vanilla alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot showing three PCalc windows. In the center is a calculator with advanced functions visible." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/461pIo7eJjAQxXQu7HX6yBZ2zR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804663/4.8_Hero_small.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TLA Systems&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCalc for Mac.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tlcoMd"&gt;“I’ve always notionally competed with the built-in apps since day one, so I try not to stress out too much about it,” Thomson says. “Apple has to make relatively straightforward apps that can be easily used by a billion or so people, so there’s a lot of things they can’t or won’t do. You just need to go a bit deeper and build something that will appeal to a smaller number of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfM1II"&gt;It’s a similar strategy taken by popular alternative camera app, Halide, which offers far more advanced features than Apple’s own camera app. Halide co-founder Sebastiaan de With says, “We try to target our products to a market that Apple would be foolish to chase. For example, exposing manual exposure controls would alienate most of their very casual audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="izC5KH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We try to target our products to a market that Apple would be foolish to chase”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWBmUg"&gt;One way to reach an audience, though, is simply by making apps that add the features you yourself were looking for. “When we launched, Halide was a passion project. We were two friends that loved photography and our dream was to make a camera app that was perfect for us,” says de With. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELmcUK"&gt;That logic applies to smaller apps, too. Mustafa Yusuf, the developer of to-do list app Tasks, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he was motivated to create his app because the default iOS Reminders app just didn’t have the features he wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q2ubiN"&gt;“When I started [developing apps], as a to-do list, it gets really messy very quickly,” Yusuf says. “A feature cannot just be ‘to-do’ and done — there are a lot of steps in between and there was no way for me to do that in an orderly or a neat fashion, so it got really messy really quick, and then I just resorted to pen and paper.” So he created his own app, Tasks, which was built around offering the kinds of sub-tasks and filtering that he was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two screenshots of Halide. One shows options for auto exposure, manual exposure, and zebras. The other shows a waveform at the bottom of the viewfinder." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRLbIDZL9cl6cIwkVQmJd_18VBY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804688/2_Up___Pro_Tools.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lux&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halide includes advanced exposure tools like zebras and waveforms that you can’t get in the default camera app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7H5yKy"&gt;There are also other areas that give the more niche apps an edge. While Apple tends to only update its apps with major features once a year as part of its annual iOS releases, third-party developers can move at a much more rapid pace, adding more features and updates throughout the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmamSx"&gt;That doesn’t mean that Apple events are carefree. The company is infamous for its history of “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133023/apple-bluemail-blix-restored-mac-app-store-sherlocking-patent-lawsuit"&gt;Sherlocking&lt;/a&gt;” features and integrating them into its own apps. “I would be lying if I didn’t hold my breath every time there was a WWDC keynote,” Thomson says, noting the possibility that Apple may one day finally make an iPad calculator app. And de With notes that some Halide features have shown up in Apple’s Camera app later on, like its shutter animation. “It could be great minds thinking alike, or just a nice nod to us. Who knows!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuPa58"&gt;One challenge facing alternative default apps, however, is pricing. The App Store in general has been in a race to the bottom almost since its inception; in 2021, paid apps are a rarity among big names, and the top-grossing apps on the platform are — without exception — free apps with either subscriptions or in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrY8bh"&gt;And for apps like Tasks or Halide, which have to outdo their free alternatives, that’s also meant having to face the reality of subscriptions and free trials. “I cannot imagine having a paywall to even try the app out — if I had that barrier to entry, people just go solo, because there’s just a ton of free alternatives,” says Yusuf. “Forget Apple itself, right, like Google has its own thing, Microsoft has its own thing going on.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tasks app on Mac and iPad shows a navigation bar and three columns of to-dos reading “Do,” “Doing,” and “Done.” The iPhone version only shows a single column at a time." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RoeUqxIhFQuigPF4ByT68u3lcMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804678/EnrzFk1WMAY_vwG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mustafa Yusuf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tasks on an iPad, Mac, and iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CoPrPg"&gt;Subscriptions are a double-edged sword, however. They provide developers with recurring, steady revenue that they can rely on — there’s a reason that they’ve increasingly cropped up among apps like Halide, Carrot Weather, and Fantastical, which all aim to offer alternatives to Apple’s default apps. But they’re also a tougher sell to customers, who tend to be saddled with higher costs over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1fafE"&gt;It’s one of the reasons that PCalc still maintains its upfront price, despite experimenting with a free version with in-app purchases a few years ago. “As a developer, I’d really love the recurring income from a subscription model, but I don’t honestly think it’s a great fit for a standalone utility like PCalc that doesn’t have any online infrastructure to maintain,” Thomson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GrRZ0S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Even 1 percent of that billion is still a pretty huge market for an indie developer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TsMBUB"&gt;The truth of the matter is, though, that even if things dramatically change on iOS and Apple were to turn around and announce tomorrow that it would offer full access for any app to be set as a default, it seems unlikely that apps like Tasks, Halide, or PCalc will ever approach the popularity of the built-in options. Free is free, and for millions of iPhone customers, the basic apps that come with their phones are enough for the job; good is the enemy of great, especially when “good enough” comes preinstalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hF3X9C"&gt;But the sheer size of platforms like iOS (and Android, which offers slightly more options to developers when it comes to competing with defaults) means that even in the more limited circumstances, there’s still plenty of room for these alternate apps. As Thomson points out, there’s over a billion Apple devices out there. “Even 1 percent of that billion is still a pretty huge market for an indie developer, and you can hopefully find an audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaFeCr"&gt;And if the day comes when Apple relents and gives developers the chance to set their apps as defaults and face its own even more head-on (as has already happened with services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21301478/apple-ios-14-default-apps-browser-email-changes-features-report"&gt;email and web browsers in iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;), at least some developers will leap at the chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3IMPga"&gt;“Yes. A million times yes,” says de With to the idea of making Halide a default. “If it were an option on the table, we would jump through whatever hoops necessary — even if that means adjusting our app for these new considerations.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $100 million settlement agreement “clarifies” App Store rules for developers, but doesn’t change much</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIws0cqrESJtDaW4vTXq-uP4JDM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69781576/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61502r"&gt;A proposed agreement between Apple and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652460/apple-class-action-lawsuit-monopoly-app-store"&gt;a class-action lawsuit representing US app developers&lt;/a&gt; includes a $100 million payout from Apple. The &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/press/apple-ios-app-developers/us-ios-developers-to-benefit-from-100-million-apple-small-developer-assistance-fund-and-changes-to-app-store-policies-in-developer-antitrust-class-action-settlement"&gt;settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt; also has Apple “clarifying” its policies to explain that iOS developers can contact their customers, with permission, using information collected inside their apps to tell them about payment options outside the App Store. The change is a shift to the anti-steering policy that has been a big point of contention between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;Apple and its critics for years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TmUqp"&gt;The change, while potentially important for developers, isn’t quite as significant as it may seem. In an update to the App Store Guidelines in June, Apple already changed its rules to allow developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;to communicate with customers outside of their apps&lt;/a&gt;, but at that time, they weren’t allowed to contact users about alternate payment options using information obtained inside the app — they would have had to figure out how to obtain their contact info another way. If this proposed agreement is approved, that restriction would no longer be in place, which should make it easier for developers to reach out to users. Still, it’s not what many developers have been asking for: a way to let users know, &lt;em&gt;inside their app, &lt;/em&gt;that they don’t have to pay using Apple’s in-app payment system and incur its up-to-30-percent toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1XFgjO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The proposed $100 million payout would be split by developers who made less than $1 million per year from the App Store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DCRkq9"&gt;Apple’s press release spins the entire settlement as a generous offer to developers, including the anti-steering change: “To give developers even more flexibility to reach their customers, Apple is also clarifying that developers can use communications, such as email, to share information about payment methods outside of their iOS app,” &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates/"&gt;the company writes&lt;/a&gt;. “As always, developers will not pay Apple a commission on any purchases taking place outside of their app or the App Store. Users must consent to the communication and have the right to opt-out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiPlG1"&gt;The company is also making a number of other concessions as part of the proposed agreement for &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15721902/cameron-v-apple-inc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameron et al v. Apple Inc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the big one being a payout of $100 million, which will be split among small developers who earned $1 million or less “for all of their apps in every calendar year in which the developers had an account between June 4, 2015, and April 26, 2021.” Apple has decided to name this the “Small Developer Assistance Fund.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99SSei"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.smallappdeveloperassistance.com/"&gt;website for eligible developers&lt;/a&gt; isn’t fully operational yet (and may not be until the settlement is approved by a judge), but court filings show how the money could be distributed. A proceeds tier ranging from one penny to over $1 million sorts out the potential return, with developers in line for a minimum payment of between $250 and $30,000. That will vary depending on how many people submit approved claims, with leftover funds going to the Girls Who Code nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ciylng"&gt;One of the lawsuit’s named plaintiffs, Richard Czeslawski, &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/press/apple-ios-app-developers/us-ios-developers-to-benefit-from-100-million-apple-small-developer-assistance-fund-and-changes-to-app-store-policies-in-developer-antitrust-class-action-settlement"&gt;says in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “...we’ve gained the ability to use contact information obtained from signups in our app to communicate with our users outside the app about purchasing alternatives to IAP. That’s a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMS3GM"&gt;Other points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MxAvSc"&gt;A promise to keep the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;, which allows developers who earn less than $1 million in a year to apply for a reduced 15 percent commission from their sales, in place in its “current structure” for at least the next three years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UbCuwt"&gt;The company will publish an annual transparency report about the App Store. Apple says the report will include “meaningful statistics about the app review process, including the number of apps rejected for different reasons, the number of customer and developer accounts deactivated, objective data regarding search queries and results, and the number of apps removed from the App Store.” It’s unclear when the first report will be released, but the company is committing to releasing the report for at least three years. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4NMX3q"&gt;Developers will be able to set more than 500 price points for subscriptions, in-app purchases, and paid apps. Right now, they’re limited to fewer than 100, so the jump will allow developers to offer a wider range of prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OLFgtE"&gt;Apple is committing to keeping the current App Store Search system in place “for at least the next three years.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1431058415263039488?s=21"&gt;Tapbots developer Paul Haddad points out why&lt;/a&gt; that’s not necessarily what all developers want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JHR0UR"&gt;The company will add an unspecified amount and type of additional information about the app appeals process &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/"&gt;to the App Review website&lt;/a&gt; to “help developers understand how the appeals process works.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="PqSZj7"&gt;The proposed changes come on the heels of another big App Store change announced Thursday: Apple announced that it will take a 15 percent cut of publishers’ in-app purchases and subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642902/apple-news-partner-program-lower-commission"&gt;if they join Apple News&lt;/a&gt; instead of 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will take a smaller cut of publishers’ sales if they join Apple News</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple News on a MacBook and iPhone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VbenwCYxz6C6cERjRNiXJFzkIAc=/95x0:1748x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779318/image__2_.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5e7ktH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-introduces-the-news-partner-program/"&gt;has a new offer for publishers&lt;/a&gt;: join Apple News, and it’ll only take 15 percent out of your in-app purchases and subscriptions instead of 30. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/news-partner/"&gt;Publishers can apply to Apple’s News Partner Program&lt;/a&gt; to take that bargain, but they have to agree to Apple’s requirements, which naturally benefit Apple and go beyond just maintaining a channel in Apple News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAVW3L"&gt;The list of specific eligibility requirements to apply is short but worth sharing in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="re918R"&gt;You must maintain a robust Apple News channel in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and publish all content to that channel in Apple News Format. If you’re based outside of these regions and do not publish in Apple News Format, you must share content via an RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABvMvR"&gt;The primary function of your app must be to deliver original, professionally-authored news content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRF37b"&gt;Your app must be available on the App Store and allow users to purchase auto-renewable subscriptions through Apple’s in-app purchase system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAbIAM"&gt;The Account Holder of an Apple Developer Program membership must agree to a separate addendum to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DVrn3S"&gt;So publishers are expected to maintain their Apple News channel, publish in the Apple News Format (ANF), and offer an app in the App Store that offers auto-renewable subscriptions and only “original, professionally-authored news content.” Apple says the News Partner Program will also support and fund organizations that educate readers on news media literacy and “further efforts to diversify newsrooms and news coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BvrIdQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A dramatic reduction in fees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJq28u"&gt;It’s extra work to maintain an app and publish in an entirely separate, proprietary format, but based on what Apple reportedly asked of publishers in the past, this might be a welcome reprieve. Apple traditionally takes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12774758/apple-developers-app-store-new-subscription-rules"&gt;a 30 percent commission on in-app subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; that drops to 15 percent after a year, but before Apple News launched, rumors suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18222281/apple-news-subscription-service-50-percent-cut-publishers-media-deal"&gt;Apple was asking publishers for 50 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, news publishers weren’t very happy about that, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21378156/apple-news-publishers-subscription-deal-app-store-cut-terms-amazon-letter"&gt;once they found out Amazon got special treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VyJQr"&gt;After the rough treatment, it’s not clear if the News Partner Program will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307242/apple-news-new-york-times-app-not-available-free-articles-subscription"&gt;entice former publishers like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; There’s also the consideration of how this looks considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; in which Apple is currently embroiled in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;and abroad&lt;/a&gt;. But the company hasn’t exactly been one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;to consider the optics of major business shifting decisions&lt;/a&gt; as of late, so maybe it’s hoping publishers won’t either.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s incorrect, Apple will support those efforts. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
