    <title>Adobe releases Apple Silicon version of Premiere Pro in beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1pSOOnlCu8CTFOf7nfR1F0j2pY=/0x0:749x499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559369/PPro.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r6qYc8"&gt;Adobe has released an Arm version of Premiere Pro for macOS, allowing owners of new Apple Silicon M1 Macs to run the video editing software natively. The program is still very much in beta for now, however, and the &lt;a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-beta/discuss-premiere-pro-on-apple-silicon-m1/td-p/11691346?page=1"&gt;Adobe post announcing its availability&lt;/a&gt; lists a host of known bugs and missing features. News of its release was &lt;a href="https://the8-bit.com/adobe-premiere-pro-for-m1-macs-now-available-to-public-beta-testers/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The 8-Bit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/premiere-pro-premiere-rush-audition-for-m1-beta/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; adds&lt;/a&gt; that Adobe’s Premiere Rush and Audition have also been updated to run on the new machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkSxYy"&gt;Adobe says it’s porting Premiere Pro’s features over in phases, starting with its core editing functions and workflows, as well as popular codecs like H.264, HEVC, and ProRes. Third-party integrations will need to be updated by their respective developers to work on Apple Silicon. Adobe advises that users can run the current release version of Premiere Pro on M1 Macs using Rosetta 2 emulation while the Arm version is still in development, though some third-party integrations may not work in this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaQRE2"&gt;Premiere Pro joins other Adobe apps including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571070/adobe-photoshop-arm64-beta-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571070/adobe-photoshop-arm64-beta-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Lightroom&lt;/a&gt; that have seen releases for Apple’s new Arm-based Macs. It’s a relatively quick turnaround for Adobe considering the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini were only released just over a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dozens of Al Jazeera journalists targeted in apparent iOS spyware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CbJr-LdQ9t6mMic2yNHFwEeQFas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559162/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QGHkvY"&gt;36 personal phones belonging to Al Jazeera journalists, producers, anchors, and executives were hacked in a spyware campaign between July and August 2020, &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/"&gt;a new report from Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt; alleges. The attacks reportedly used Pegasus technology provided by the Israeli firm NSO Group, and are thought to be the work of four operators. Citizen Lab says it has “medium confidence” that one is working on behalf of the UAE government and another for the Saudi government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1mZNr"&gt;The attacks are worrying not just because they appear to show politically-motivated targeting of journalists, but also because they’re part of a trend of using increasingly advanced methods that are harder to detect. According to Citizen Lab, the attacks seem to have used a zero-click exploit to compromise iPhones via iMessage, meaning the attacks happened without the victims needing to do anything, and leave much less of a trace once a device is infected. In July 2020, the exploit chain was a zero-day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="b4U0XN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS 14 is not thought to be vulnerable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xl91yS"&gt;Citizen Lab’s report says “almost all iPhone devices” which haven’t been updated to iOS 14 appear to be vulnerable to the hack, meaning the infections it found are likely to be a “miniscule fraction” of the total number. It has disclosed its findings to Apple, and the company is looking into the issue. Citizen Lab’s analysis suggests the spyware can record audio from a phone (including ambient noise and audio from phone calls), take photos, track location, and access passwords. Devices updated to iOS 14 don’t appear to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUvkiT"&gt;Citizen Lab discovered one of the hacks after Al Jazeera journalist, Tamer Almisshal, allowed the organization to install a VPN on his device because he was worried it might have been compromised. Using this software, Citizen Lab, noticed that his phone visited a suspected installation server for NSO Group’s spyware. Seconds later, his phone uploaded over 200MB of data to three IP addresses for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwYgD5"&gt;As well as the Al Jazeera employees, Citizen Lab reports that a journalist with Al Araby TV, Rania Dridi, was also the victim of hacks using NSO Group’s spyware. These attacks date back to October 2019, and appear to include two zero-day exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0MCsi"&gt;This is not the first time allegations have emerged that spyware from NSO Group has been used to target journalists. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/20/citizen-lab-nso-dozens-of-aljazeera-journalists-allegedly-hacked-using-israeli-firm-spyware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the software has allegedly been used to target journalists in Morocco, as well as political dissidents from Rwanda and Spanish politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ewhJZ"&gt;When contacted for comment a spokesperson for NSO Group told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Citizen Lab’s report was based on “speculation” and “lacks any evidence supporting a connection to NSO.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJTXOs"&gt;“NSO provides products that enable governmental law enforcement agencies to tackle serious organized crime and counterterrorism only, and as stated in the past we do not operate them,” the spokesperson said. “However, when we receive credible evidence of misuse with enough information which can enable us to assess such credibility, we take all necessary steps in accordance with our investigation procedure in order to review the allegations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhDZmC"&gt;As a result of its investigation, Citizen Lab is calling for more regulations over the use of surveillance technology, and for a global moratorium on its sale and transfer until safeguards are put in place to guard against its misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Bridgerton, Palmer, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fZShpCHvIFY6ai3whgaN086rHDM=/231x72:1634x1007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68557464/Screen_Shot_2020_12_20_at_1.34.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRK60L"&gt;Hi, I’m Jay! I’m subbing in for your usual trailers guide Kim Lyons while she takes a well-deserved holiday break. I’ve really been looking forward to writing this post. Trailers are fun! They’re like bite-sized movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KY1ma"&gt;Unfortunately, there weren’t a ton of trailers to choose from this week. I suppose studios don’t want to launch big trailers for upcoming blockbusters shortly before everyone takes off for the holidays. But there were still a few good ones to watch, including a trailer for a series launching on Netflix later this week. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="icRUIG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpv7ayf_tyE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q9TbTN"&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XCvNbh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; is Shona Rhimes’ upcoming British period drama for Netflix, the first series resulting from her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16142342/shonda-rhimes-deal-netflix-greys-anatomy-scandal"&gt;mega-deal with Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like it should hit a lot of the expected high points from a period drama, such as a budding relationship between two people of high society, lots of witty one-liners, and extravagant settings, dancing, and costumes. And I’m sure Rhimes’ influence will make the show all the more exciting. &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; will be released on Netflix on December 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7BExhw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8jVuOheTNGQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j6RMOS"&gt;Palmer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JafKlA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Palmer&lt;/em&gt; stars Justin Timberlake as a man trying to rebuild his life after being in prison. Soon after he returns home, he begins taking care of a small boy, Sam, whose mother has disappeared. The movie looks like it will focus on how the two help each other overcome their difficulties. The movie will be released on January 29th on Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LfOlfO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6sxCFZ8_d84?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bCBwY0"&gt;Nomadland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5yYPf8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; is about a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who hits the road in her van and becomes a nomad. It’s the third movie directed by Chloé Zhao, who also directed &lt;em&gt;Songs My Brothers Taught Me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Rider. &lt;/em&gt;The trailer is beautiful and contemplative — the movie feels like it will be perfect for a quiet night curled up in a blanket. &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; is set for a US theatrical release on February 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v1SxkE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwYhA5YvdNc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BtmiMn"&gt;Outside the Wire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fMhc1x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outside the Wire’s&lt;/em&gt; trailer has lots of athletic jumps, explosions, robots, and loud drumming, so I hope that translates to a fun and campy action movie. (Basically, it seems like the opposite of &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt;.) And Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/only-on-netflix/81074110"&gt;official description for the movie&lt;/a&gt; makes me even more intrigued: “Set in the future, Harp (Damson Idris), a drone pilot, is sent into a deadly militarized zone where he finds himself working for Leo (Anthony Mackie), an android officer, tasked to locate a doomsday device before the insurgents do.” Sweet, I’m in. &lt;em&gt;Outside the Wire&lt;/em&gt; will hit Netflix on January 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OFICxT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SntsSsMLUWA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3cHU9z"&gt;WandaVision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dir6hL"&gt;Disney has also released another short trailer for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming Disney Plus series from Marvel Studios. Elizabeth Olsen stars as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany as Vision. If you’ve been anticipating &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, you won’t have to wait long until you can finally watch it — the show premieres on January 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JI7aQo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFmMCq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNLx7C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wM7igq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jsXF6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just temporarily closed all 53 stores in California and over a dozen in London</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store SoHo STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrGZwPSsEtFW25xPILUVPvG_ylk=/6x0:1020x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68554340/apple-store-soho-stock-logo_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iyFjdG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac’&lt;/em&gt;s Michael Steeber &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelSteeber/status/1340288965841219584"&gt;noticed a interesting coincidence today&lt;/a&gt;: the company has temporarily closed every single retail store in California, many more across the US, both stores in Mexico, both stores in Brazil, and is about to close 16 additional stores across the UK. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/19/apple-retail-stores-closed-holiday-season/"&gt;As Steeber points out&lt;/a&gt;, that’s nearly 100 stores if we include ones it closed in Germany and the Netherlands last week, leaving nearly a fifth of the company’s locations now closed worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceDpeM"&gt;I checked &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fretail%2Fstorelist%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F19%2F22190895%2Fapple-close-retails-stores-covid-19-london-california-pandemic#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s complete list of stores&lt;/a&gt; to confirm, and sure enough: every California store, all four in Tennessee, all three in Utah, all four in Minnesota, two in Oklahoma, and the stores in Portland, Oregon; Anchorage, Alaska; Omaha, Nebraska; and Albuquerque, New Mexico are all closed this upcoming week — as well as the 16 additional stores in the UK, Mexico and Brazil starting tomorrow, December 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DwrbkE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stay home, wear a mask&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bhZgnS"&gt;It’s not hard to guess why the stores are reclosing, particularly in California &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-19/california-coronavirus-record-cases-deaths"&gt;where COVID-19 saw its four deadliest days yet in a row last week&lt;/a&gt; as part of an ongoing surge, and in London where Prime Minister Boris Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-19/london-put-in-emergency-lockdown-as-u-k-fights-new-virus-strain"&gt;has just put the city in emergency lockdown starting midnight&lt;/a&gt;. Apple confirmed the gist&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of it in a statement: “Due to current Covid-19 conditions in some of the communities we serve, we are temporarily closing stores in these areas,” the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-12-19/apple-temporarily-shuts-all-california-stores-as-covid-surges?__twitter_impression=true"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qdDRh"&gt;Yesterday, California activated its emergency alert system in the SF Bay Area for the first time since the pandemic began, sending a message directly to every phone to help people understand that a stay-at-home order is now in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Apple puts another supplier on probation after exploited workers smashed up a building</title>

  &lt;p id="4qOySW"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556154/apple-supplier-pegatron-student-labor-violation"&gt;the second time in two months&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is putting one of the companies it hires to build the iPhone on notice for violating labor laws. &lt;em&gt;Reuters, Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and others are reporting that Apple has put Taiwanese manufacturing giant Wistron on “probation” — meaning it won’t receive any new business from Apple until it sorts things out — after the supplier was found exploiting workers at a plant in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krl426"&gt;The reason we’re hearing about this at all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22172383/workers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;is rather incredible&lt;/a&gt;: on December 12th, some 2,000 workers decided to protest unpaid wages by rioting at one of Wistron’s offices, smashing up the lobby and overturning vehicles. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TOIBengaluru/status/1337615298761912321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1337615298761912321%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F13%2F22172383%2Fworkers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;There’s video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ib8q0g"&gt;It now turns out that the workers’ complaints were legitimate: &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/indian-iphone-factory-apologizes-to-workers-for-mishandling-wages-11608388075?mod=mhp"&gt;Wistron is admitting as much&lt;/a&gt;, and the local government found serious labor violations in its preliminary investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3114491/wistrons-apple-factory-india-committed-serious-violations"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-india-wistron/apple-supplier-wistron-could-not-manage-scaled-up-india-plant-government-report-says-idUSKBN28T0C9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;They say Wistron was indeed underpaying wages and forcing some people to work overtime. And that’s just Wistron itself. The &lt;em&gt;SCMP &lt;/em&gt;reports police are also investigating middlemen who are targeting Apple’s contract workers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="RITUTM"&gt;There have also been allegations of middlemen exploiting the contract workers and skimming their wages, with police looking into the role of six contractors who acted as go-betweens for Wistron. They reportedly lured workers by promising them an additional allowance if they forewent breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S3BeRM"&gt;The investigation also reportedly reveals that 8,500 of the Wistron factory’s 10,500 workers were contractors rather than full-time employees, and that the plant may have only been permitted for 5,000 workers to begin with. (Wistron started assembling iPhones in India &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15651842/apple-iphone-india-assembling-begun"&gt;back in 2017.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLKjkZ"&gt;Wistron &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chandrarsrikant/status/1340205614484504576"&gt;issued an apology&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it’s “enhancing its processes and restructuring our teams to ensure these issues cannot happen again,” adding that it’s already established “a 24-hour grievance hotline” and “an employee assistant program.” The company says it also sacked its VP of business in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFlr7E"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybNMYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MlkRf"&gt;The question now is whether Apple will do anything meaningful to keep its suppliers from exploiting workers now that they’re making headlines yet again. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/12/8024895/apple-slave-labor-working-conditions-2015"&gt;a notable history of being associated with labor violations&lt;/a&gt;, and a recent report suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;that Apple turns a blind eye to them&lt;/a&gt; even when it knows there’s a problem. Did Apple know about this? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: two new Google antitrust cases and an AirPods Max review </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QTMjBY"&gt;It seems like there’s no sign of tech news stopping for the holidays. In &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;s &lt;/em&gt;last regular episode of 2020, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn and Nilay Patel bring on senior reporter Adi Robertson and editor Chris Welch to explain the biggest stories in tech from this past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd5sEh"&gt;In the first half of the show, Adi explains two (!) more antitrust cases brought against Google this week: one from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas attorney general&lt;/a&gt; and the other from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;a coalition of 38 states&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;breaks down their arguments about Google’s alleged anti-competitive behavior around ad tech and search manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2gnAW"&gt;In the second half of the show, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; shift gears to a review of the latest product announcement from Apple: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. Chris reviewed the new $550 headphones for the site, and he details his experience on the show — from comfortability to design and sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaKqS2"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like a privacy debate between Facebook and Apple, some rumors about the next Samsung flagship phones, and the ability to “ProRAW” image capture on the iPhone 12 Pro — so listen through to hear it all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple explains how the AirPods Max conserve battery life — with or without the case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mbEe7tg3aOiglzwJ2U5i7-NDI4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547607/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckRZ6B"&gt;After some initial confusion around how the AirPods Max handle power management, Apple has tried to clarify the issue with &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886"&gt;an updated support page&lt;/a&gt; outlining how and when its new $550 headphones automatically conserve battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyxn56"&gt;Originally, the company said that “when stored in their soft, slim smart case, AirPods Max enter an ultra‑low‑power state that preserves charge.” But there was uncertainty about what happens when they’re left &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the case. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;In my review&lt;/a&gt;, I found that the headphones lost only a few battery percentage points when left out overnight with no case — nothing close to a worrying level of drain. But not everyone had that experience; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvvo6vUpJRc"&gt;Marques Brownlee&lt;/a&gt; observed a greater amount of battery loss when the AirPods Max were idle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgLlfQ"&gt;According to Apple, the AirPods Max enter a “low power mode” when removed from your head and left stationary for five minutes outside of the case. If they’re left in that state for 72 hours, they go into a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; power mode that switches off Bluetooth and features like Apple’s Find My location tracking. This, essentially, sounds like when they actually turn “off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgvvoN"&gt;But somewhat surprisingly, the smart case doesn’t immediately trigger this deeper sleep mode as quickly as I would’ve thought. Inserting the AirPods Max into the case puts them into that lighter low power mode right away. But it takes 18 hours of the headphones being in the smart case for them to enter the ultra-low power mode. When the case is factored in, Apple never mentions that the headphones have to be “stationary” to enter these modes. But the fact that it takes almost an entire 24 hours for the AirPods Max to hit that point where they maximize battery — even in the case — is a bit surprising to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnVW3m"&gt;Clearly, the company is prioritizing quick device reconnections and convenience over eking every last bit of battery out of the AirPods Max. One big question is what happens if the headphones are left worn around your neck when removed; since they’re not stationary in that scenario, my guess is that they remain fully active until taken off and put on a table or stand. It’s possible that Apple could adjust these default behaviors through firmware updates, but for now, this is how the AirPods Max work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18Qv0J"&gt;Even if I’ve seen minimal battery drain, and just as I say in our video review, I still wish they had a power button. For simplicity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In 2020, live product launches turned into infomercials</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aq1uGK45AzLyJpC8pmeuQq5zcAM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547449/acastro_201207_4324_infomercials_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jWImwY"&gt;In a year when the spread of COVID-19 made bringing large crowds together impossible, companies around the world had to reevaluate their love affair with the live product launch. Packing hundreds of attendees into extravagant venues to hang on every word of company executives was never going to be possible in an era of social distancing. Instead, events moved online, and many changed completely in the process as companies dropped risky product demonstrations in favor of slick prerecorded video segments. These events effectively turned from live launches into infomercials, and it makes me wonder how the likes of Apple, Amazon, Google, Sony, or Microsoft will be able to go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrRDC"&gt;It’s a striking change, thanks in part to how consistent the format for most launches has stayed over the last three decades. In 1984, Apple CEO Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tQ5XwvjPmA"&gt;showed off the Macintosh’s features&lt;/a&gt; through onstage demonstrations, a slideshow presentation, and video segments like the famous &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA"&gt;Ridley Scott-directed ad&lt;/a&gt;. Decades later, in 2019, the format had barely changed. When Apple CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6XBRvfupm0"&gt;launched the iPhone 11&lt;/a&gt; alongside a host of other devices last year, the budgets may have been bigger, the product list longer, and the demos more polished, but the whole event followed the same playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mHJV2R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The format for products launches has been consistent for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uHYfIu"&gt;One day after Samsung held a similarly traditional in-person event in February to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guptCU6yUEk"&gt;unveil its Galaxy S20 smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;GSM Association canceled Mobile World Congress&lt;/a&gt;, an annual trade show that was due to take place in Barcelona. The announcement didn’t come out of the blue — multiple companies, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21123169/lg-electronics-mwc-2020-cornavirus-cancel-withdraw-outbreak-concern"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131118/mwc-2020-coronavirus-intel-sony-amazon-cancel"&gt;Nvidia, Intel, Vivo, Sony, and Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, had already dropped out — but it made it clear to the industry that the days of business as usual were over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62ajMi"&gt;But even in a pandemic year, especially a year where many needed new equipment to adapt to new ways of working, gadgets still needed to come out. The question became &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;to launch them. Early on, many companies appeared to simply take the presentations they would have otherwise done in person and move them online. The reduced audience noise was the only hint that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4nFTqmuQxY"&gt;Huawei’s P40 series launch event in March&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t happening in a typical room full of journalists, while &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOWVrkL_DEE&amp;amp;t=1209s"&gt;OnePlus was more upfront about the empty auditorium in which it launched its 8 series&lt;/a&gt;. Sony didn’t even bother with a big empty room for its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph8LyNIT9sg&amp;amp;t=513s"&gt;PS5 Game Developers Conference presentation&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it opted to have the console’s lead system architect, Mark Cerny, outline its capabilities in front of what appeared to be a green screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D74V8K"&gt;Before long, however, companies were experimenting with formats that would have never been possible with an in-person audience. Samsung, for example, had giant augmented reality versions of its devices appear during its &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/KnkckgwLcV8?t=508"&gt;August Unpacked event live stream&lt;/a&gt; for its onstage presenters to pretend to gawp at. The presentation may have been happening live, but these elements wouldn’t have been possible with a regular audience present.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Oexepa3emEXVjYuu4z8-l3uSus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159720/msedge_IHNfdSlQh9.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmS5rlX9cDA&amp;amp;t=4686s" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual flourishes like this would be impossible during an in-person event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4fAy7o"&gt;No one shifted quicker or more completely to a new presentation style than Apple. Its live product launches gave way to streamlined prerecorded presentations filled with computer-generated graphs and sweeping transitions around the firm’s monolithic donut-shaped headquarters (often nicknamed “the spaceship”). The first of these was its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q8AKghK44M"&gt;Worldwide Developers Conference keynote in June&lt;/a&gt;, but it used similar formats for its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMk1PYowq8M&amp;amp;t=8s"&gt;trio&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpw_z9vBPAE&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umoEDgl_xBo&amp;amp;t=3s"&gt;launches&lt;/a&gt; later in the year. Other companies, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaBXd-96uNg&amp;amp;t=10s"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSE1Ya_xOoY&amp;amp;t=488s"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpVMKZ"&gt;They may have changed their launches primarily for health and safety, but they gained a lot from their new approach. Presentations could be more dynamic and densely packed with information as they were honed to their essential elements. These new launches were also less reliant on the often-shaky onstage charisma of company executives. But most importantly, these presentations removed the possibility of anything &lt;em&gt;going wrong&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C4TrvN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prerecording a presentation removes the possibility of things going wrong&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IzHFB2"&gt;The tech world has a long and illustrious history of onstage mishaps — whether it’s an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42614281"&gt;LG robot that repeatedly fails to respond to commands&lt;/a&gt;, the Tesla Cybertruck’s supposedly bulletproof glass that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/m7atGkba-Z8?t=72"&gt;smashed not once but twice&lt;/a&gt; after being hit by a ball bearing, Apple’s new facial recognition security &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TLMpuZp4iw"&gt;failing to recognize faces&lt;/a&gt;, or Microsoft’s speech recognition technology &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX8oYoYy2Gc"&gt;failing to recognize speech&lt;/a&gt;. Live demonstrations always carry the risk of things going sideways. Sometimes nothing goes wrong onstage at all, but an audience’s laughter will shatter the illusion that $999 is a reasonable price to pay &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuW4Suo4OVg"&gt;for a monitor stand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poPv1t"&gt;But the risk of failure means a live demonstration is that much more impressive when it goes right, like Google’s demonstration of its Glass eyewear at its I/O developer conference &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7TB8b2t3QE"&gt;back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. “This can go wrong in about 500 different ways,” was how Google co-founder Sergey Brin introduced the demo, which saw a group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3121164/project-glass-demo-io"&gt;live-stream their skydive&lt;/a&gt; down to San Francisco’s Moscone Center using Google Glass. It was an excessive, over-the-top display, but it left little doubt that the device was capable of what Google showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sccj7O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7TB8b2t3QE?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=524&amp;amp;start=524" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ryY5CU"&gt;Few launches are as over-the-top as this, but everything from a demonstration of a voice assistant to new augmented reality developer tools is made that little bit more believable by watching it happen live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="siAiSw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Live” doesn’t guarantee “real,” but it helps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kR5KnF"&gt;And yet, a live demonstration is no guarantee of authenticity. Take the presenters who played &lt;em&gt;Kinect Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; at Microsoft’s E3 press conference in 2010, who appeared to be &lt;a href="https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/e3-2010-star-wars-kinect-video/"&gt;miming along with the on-screen action&lt;/a&gt; rather than controlling it directly. Other showcases give unfinished products a bit of a helping hand, like when the original iPhone’s antennas had to be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/magazine/and-then-steve-said-let-there-be-an-iphone.html#after-story-ad-2:~:text=The%20software%20in%20the%20iPhone%E2%80%99s%20Wi%2DFi,wouldn%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20travel%20as%20far."&gt;connected to wires running offstage&lt;/a&gt; during its 2007 unveiling to make up for its unstable Wi-Fi radio software. In some cases, we’re so conditioned to expect trickery that an onstage hiccup can actually make a presentation more impressive by revealing that it’s being done for real, like when &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4 &lt;/em&gt;co-director Bruce Straley found himself onstage &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/20/8817971/uncharted-4-e3-demo-blooper-snafu-gaffe"&gt;without the controller to actually play the game&lt;/a&gt; at Sony’s E3 presentation. The resulting 30 seconds of idle animation was enough to prove that the subsequent gameplay was definitely being played live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjhyIQ"&gt;Live demos don’t prove that what you’re seeing is real, but they’re still a lot more believable than something prepared ahead of time. A prerecorded infomercial just doesn’t have the same stakes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/peIeoOEkrFTQ2e_USYh2TppYDHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159748/msedge_BlyQF5A9fz.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AwdkGKmZ0I" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was harder to believe Apple’s performance claims based on a prerecorded presentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q9LqJ"&gt;In 2020, every presentation went off without a hitch, but it was hard not to doubt what we were being shown. Apple attempted to re-create some of the impact of a live event &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE?t=5718"&gt;during its WWDC 2020 presentation&lt;/a&gt; when Craig Federighi revealed that a previous macOS Big Sur demonstration had &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; taken place on Macs running Apple Silicon rather than Intel chips. But considering any crashes or hitches could have been easily edited out, the revelation didn’t have the same impact as it would have. Most remained skeptical of the company’s claims until they were actually able to use the laptops for themselves months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KL1ozA"&gt;2020’s shift in product launches saw companies trade risky live demonstrations for tightly scripted videos. The question now is how quickly they’ll want to go back when it’s safe to do so. For some, I suspect the control they’ve had this year will be hard to give up. They’ll have seen how consistent and reliable a virtual launch can be, and the idea of returning to the unpredictability of doing things live won’t seem worth the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2441uH"&gt;Personally, I hope most companies avoid the temptation. Live launches might be fraught, logistical nightmares, but they’re also an opportunity to have a real impact and show why a new device, service, or game is actually worth paying attention to. Journalists will always exist to eventually separate reality from marketing, but a show-stopping event can be the thing that gets people interested enough to read a review in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the most affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Sometimes, there just isn’t a deal happening. In that case, we’ve mentioned how much the most recent sale price was for, so you know when to take the plunge. But most of the time, there’s some sort of deal going on, be it on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, you’ll find it mentioned with any and all context you need to hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rFr0TF"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad 2020 review: here we go again, again|95745" data-volume-uuid="d243cb26d" data-volume-id="95745" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-699" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the tablet with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can get the base iPad with 128GB of storage for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J61NFNR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$380 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s2PEas"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, carrying forth the same 7.9-inch display and design from previous iterations with refreshed internal specs within. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini with Wi-Fi support, set at $400 and $500, respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on this model are a little rarer, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8VVG4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$350 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $394 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18282956/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-ios-features-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2019 &amp;amp; 2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display and features thinner bezels around the display and has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u6ZCyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air 2019 review: happy medium","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18282956/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-ios-features-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, this year’s iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. However, the model that also supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;If you’re looking for the latest iPad model, B&amp;amp;H Photo has select colors on sale. You can get the 64GB configuration in &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594485-REG%2Fapple_myfn2ll_a_10_9_ipad_air_wi_fi.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Silver for only $569&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594484-REG%2Fapple_myfm2ll_a_10_9_ipad_airwi_fi_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Space Gray model for $579&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7jir3Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oBFocq"&gt;If you don’t mind the last generation model, Best Buy is discounting the 3rd Gen 2019 iPad Air by &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724958762425958680" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 off for the 64GB model&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $430. Or, you can get a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724958787565478388" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model, which is down to $600&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X1XOEB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nFcTiz"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-86" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the one that came in 2018, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less-expensive models, this one ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also has Face ID to unlock instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and has a high refresh display. The iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, and that comes through in the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800, and bumping up the screen size to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each size supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec model going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, the 128GB model with Wi-Fi is on sale starting at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553825-REG%2Fapple_my252ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$769 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08637NV8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$794 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you are ok with spending $1,000 or more on this model, you can get 512GB of storage for $999 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553815-REG%2Fapple_mxdf2ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;; or you can buy 1TB for $1,200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08634Y7QW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553817-REG%2Fapple_mxdh2ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eK4A7f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, both Amazon and B&amp;amp;H Photo also have the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale starting at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=958f5d1d759db7b7f32427d6bb516a5c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$949 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553841-REG%2Fapple_my2j2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5ZZTi"&gt;The latest development in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing lawsuit between Epic Games and Apple&lt;/a&gt; over the iPhone maker’s App Store policies is a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F488521365%2FApple-Versus-Epic-Federighi-Must-Testify%23from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2F22187339%2Fepic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-testimony-tim-cook-craig-federighi#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new order&lt;/a&gt; from Judge Thomas Hixson outlining rules for Apple CEO Tim Cook’s planned testimony in the case, as well as whether software engineering chief Craig Federighi may have to participate in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFqyIy"&gt;The court order, spotted on Thursday by &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-must-hand-over-craig-federighi-documents-epic-games-lawsuit-court-rules?utm_source=im_tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw_card&amp;amp;utm_content=72410&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iMore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/17/judge-orders-tim-cook-and-craig-federighi-to-testify-in-epic-case"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, gives us our first glimpse into how Apple’s executive leadership may be involved in the ongoing antitrust lawsuit, which is scheduled to go to trial as early as July of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PwjasY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple failed to limit Tim Cook’s eventual testimony to just four hours&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AuKda0"&gt;The order, issued on Wednesday following a December 15th hearing, says Apple will not be able to limit Cook’s testimony to four hours, as the company had sought. Only after Apple provides the necessary documents requested by Epic’s lawyers on the App Store’s operations can the length of testimony be determined, the order states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3bdGC"&gt;Hixon also shot down a request from Apple to replace Federighi with Erik Neuenschwander. the company’s director of privacy engineering. Federighi is now listed as a document custodian, which will have an effect on which documents are entered into discovery at the request of Epic’s lawyers. It does not, however, mean he has to testify — but there is a possibility he will be ordered to do so in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qU9Y2q"&gt;“The Court rules for Plaintiffs and orders Apple to make Federighi a document custodian instead of Neuenschwander. First, Plaintiffs have shown that Federighi is a higher-level decision maker whose documents are more likely to go to the heart of Apple’s business justification defense,” reads the order. “Second, if Plaintiffs have guessed wrong, and Federighi’s documents are not as relevant as Neuenschwander’s are, that hurts Plaintiffs. Assuming the requests are relevant and proportional, it is up to Plaintiffs to decide what discovery they want to take to prove their claims, and if they make bad choices, that’s their problem.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoQxdL"&gt;The case is still in the preliminary stages, and much of the public back-and-forth criticism from Apple and Epic that erupted in August has quieted as both sides’ lawyers have begun preparing for the next stages of the lawsuit. An upcoming deadline for new filings is set for January 6th, 2021 with a hearing two days later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Fo2735"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Apple CEO Tim Cook and software engineering chief Craig Federighi were ordered to testify in case. That is incorrect; Apple offered to have Cook deposed, but was disputing the length of time. Federighi was made a document custodian, but a decision has not been made whether he will have to testify in the case. The headline has been updated to reflect these changes. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
