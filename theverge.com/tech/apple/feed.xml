    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jwd5Mq"&gt;In 2019, an &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/28/its-middle-night-do-you-know-who-your-iphone-is-talking/?utm_term=.f643c2a83a4c"&gt;article in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Geoffrey Fowler described the author’s shock when he discovered just how many of his iPhone apps were collecting and uploading information about his usage while he slept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqUHGx"&gt;As we all know by now, data is a huge commodity these days. If you use a phone, laptop, or any type of computing device (unless you’re a security expert or a high-end hacker with access to sophisticated blocking tools), you’re paying for your apps by contributing marketing and other info to the companies that supply them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdXttf"&gt;As Fowler’s article demonstrated, iPhone users are not immune to this. Since his article was published, Apple has made some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;laudable changes to its privacy policies&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s still a good idea to take charge of your own data. There are some simple ways to minimize the amount of tracking that app vendors can do and the amount of data they can access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="exJEUb"&gt;Turn off personalized and location-based ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WBCofK"&gt;According to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223"&gt;Advertising &amp;amp; Privacy&lt;/a&gt; page: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="q8RHB4"&gt;Apple’s advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wLQYsb"&gt;However, the page goes on to say that contextual data, such as info about your device, its location, your App Store searches, and what you read on Apple News could be collected. You can get around this somewhat by &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074"&gt;turning off personalized and location-based ads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qhWD8Y"&gt;To turn off personalized ads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WdWeaM"&gt;Select your “Settings” app, tap on “Privacy,” and scroll down to and select “Apple Advertising” (it will be near the bottom of the list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7xqUx9"&gt;Toggle “Personalized Ads” off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-13TMuhA1KUgUKSGpDPAiCkMTWU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354741/IMG_DBA61BE67C50_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can toggle off personalized ads from Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also toggle off Location Services" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zRIXFHciFirbr26IjadMqQNZ8IM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354742/IMG_B32453FF7846_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also toggle off Location Services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tFThlr"&gt;To turn off location-based ads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="exNzsg"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services” (at the top of the display).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RGKWdi"&gt;Toggle off “Location Services.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IuI4ot"&gt;On this page, you can also change several of your apps, such as the App Store or Maps, to allow location access never, ask next time, or while using the app. Also, note that you can still use the “Find My Phone” feature; it will temporarily enable Location Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGtgw9"&gt;If you want to see how effectively your phone is protected, you could try taking the &lt;a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/"&gt;Panopticlick test&lt;/a&gt;, which is offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It monitors device fingerprinting, among other things. I ran it on an Apple iPhone 11 after following the above instructions, and I got a “partial protection” result for blocking tracking ads, blocking invisible trackers, and protecting from fingerprinting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1wLgon"&gt;Lock down Safari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2syYGD"&gt;If you use the Safari browser on your iPhone, there are several things you can do to make it safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In your iPhone’s Settings, select “Safari”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNe8EpVqCnaJX1_zwU2FGFXDYEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354806/IMG_6A5B7FC23344_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your iPhone’s Settings, select “Safari.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Enabling “Block All Cookies” is more secure, but can also be inconvenient" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fgFFNGBuWMM1KsGcpzCqqNEhxEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354812/IMG_06711E4C44E2_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enabling “Block All Cookies” is more secure but can also be inconvenient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9Lo0v1"&gt;Go to “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zdMkKN"&gt;Select “Safari,” and scroll down to the “Privacy &amp;amp; Security” section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="or38q5"&gt;Turn on “Prevent Cross-Site Tracking” (which means advertisers and other third-party content providers can’t track you from one site to another).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oX8nX2"&gt;Turn on “Block All Cookies.” The cookies collected by various websites can contain a great deal of information about how you use the site, what info you put into it, etc. By blocking cookies, you prevent that data from being collected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8bM4Zf"&gt;However, you will probably make things very inconvenient for yourself. Your visits to sites will not be recorded, so, for example, you may not be able to revisit a playlist or repurchase the same T-shirt you bought last year. Some sites will even refuse entry if you don’t allow them to collect cookies. It’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fv7b88"&gt;Turn off Background App Refresh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0XgVrk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202070"&gt;According to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, the reason to have Background App Refresh turned on is to allow suspended apps (apps that aren’t currently active) to “check for updates and new content.” According to Disconnect, the privacy app company that Geoffrey Fowler cites in his article, it also allows apps to collect marketable tracking data and transmit that data even when you’re not using the app. Interestingly, iPhones ship with Background App Refresh turned on, but it’s not terribly hard to turn off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eAlq90"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:6359379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2sishI"&gt;Go to “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EKg5tY"&gt;Select “General.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NxM8Zy"&gt;Select “Background App Refresh.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UX9E4h"&gt;You’ll see a list of all the apps that use this feature, and they’re all going to be turned on. Find “Background App Refresh” at the top of the page, and tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ITsFC2"&gt;You’ll be brought to a page that lets you enable it for Wi-Fi and cellular data, for Wi-Fi only, or you can turn it off altogether. Select “Off.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XNsYpK"&gt;If you go back to the previous page, you’ll see that all of the toggles for the various apps are completely gone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ahdHe2"&gt;You may want to be selective about which apps can work in the background. Some apps might not work well otherwise. For example, Google Photos won’t automatically back up your camera roll unless this feature is enabled. So you can, if you wish, leave “Background App Refresh” on, and then choose which specific apps you want to toggle off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YLMFr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 8th, 2021, 5:00PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on May 30th, 2018; several portions have been updated to reflect changes in iOS. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spice up your daily pandemic walk with these apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JTL09TXMNTLmfl06h24EoUsf-k=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68931867/final.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Keep the routine fresh&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vfp7Lm"&gt;As you may have heard one or two times, we’re now roughly a year into COVID and pandemic lockdown life. To fill the void in our lives that was once occupied by social gatherings, visiting family, and breathing indoor air freely, many of us have turned to new hobbies and habits. Some of them are even healthy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEv0XJ"&gt;Taking a daily or, if I’m being honest, &lt;em&gt;semi&lt;/em&gt;-daily walk is a lockdown habit that has seen me through These Unprecedented Times. I’m &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roobeekeane/status/1347644813320073220?s=20"&gt;not alone, either&lt;/a&gt; — without gyms or really anywhere else to go at all, lots of us have embraced (or at times, endured) a daily walk around the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5qr1L"&gt;To be sure, it’s not always easy. I got tired of walking by the same houses and the same pieces of fossilized trash about six months in. It rains a lot where I live and that can turn an otherwise pleasant walk into a real bummer. Other days, the motivation just isn’t there and the mailbox is as far as I get. But a few tricks along the way have helped me and fellow &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers stay committed to the walk ritual. Here are some techniques to keep your pandemic walk routine fresh and the apps that can help you put them into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BIctUh"&gt;Find a new route&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vw0WdGgH1BgVp5TrwbEgDrqQfgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354699/footpath.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footpath helps you map out new routes and gives you key information like elevation change along the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bEBgeP"&gt;This year I’ve embraced the life-changing magic of hauling myself out of my own neighborhood and going on a walk somewhere else. It feels counterproductive driving somewhere to take a walk, but it really does help shake things up when I’m burned out on my usual route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zvSG2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alltrails.com/"&gt;AllTrails&lt;/a&gt; is an app popular with hikers, but it’s also great for finding nearby parks and trails you may not know about, whether you’re in an urban spot or farther from the city. There’s also an active community who leave helpful tips, like whether the restrooms are a horror show or if the parking lot is a hotspot for break-ins. All of its basic features are available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZygxB3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://footpathapp.com/"&gt;Footpath&lt;/a&gt; is another good tool to help identify a new route, whether it’s close to home or somewhere unfamiliar. Use the app’s detailed street map to draw roughly where you’d like to go; the app will snap your route to the nearest streets and pathways. Footpath gives you important details about the route like mileage, elevation gain / loss along the way, and even a time estimate that factors in hills so you know what you’re getting into. You can trace out the full route or draw a path to a destination you’d like to reach and the app can create a loop route back to your starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEtefm"&gt;The free version will help you brainstorm some new walks, but more advanced features like turn-by-turn navigation — iPhone only for now but coming to Android soon — require an Elite subscription ($23.49 annually). Alternatively, you can add Elite features to individual saved routes for a one-time fee of $1.99 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Rmyp3f"&gt;Make it mindful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khOWzU"&gt;Any therapist or Silicon Valley CEO will tell you about the benefits of meditation. My brain is too noisy for a traditional sitting-and-breathing meditation, but I find walking meditations a lot easier to get into. &lt;a href="https://app.www.calm.com/program/wAzjO76/mindful-walking"&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.headspace.com/meditation/walking-meditation"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; (each is $69 for an annual subscription) offer walking meditations of various lengths; the ones offered by Headspace are tailored to more specific circumstances, like walking in a city or just back and forth at home. There are also plenty of free options if you search YouTube or your streaming music service of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aES93I"&gt;Find something to tune into&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/05OGacEC6uRchhIWbp9WT1AFXww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354708/apple_time_to_walk_apple_watch_airpods_01252021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time to Walk is an Apple Fitness Plus feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vhm8rP"&gt;Finding a bite-sized podcast to listen to during walk time is a nice bonus incentive to take a break and head out the door. &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2rTT1klKUoQNuaW2Ah19Pa?si=b5snZO3iT66QKGQPD24Yqw"&gt;NPR’s &lt;em&gt;Short Wave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a quick ten-ish minutes with episodes every weekday. One of my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues uses her walk to catch up on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/06iGnWl5EnkJktsKhSNeAQ?si=brnULdIcRHi2RbOUrfm4lQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gamertag Radio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Or check out an audio book from your local library with the &lt;a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/"&gt;Libby app&lt;/a&gt; to make walk time double up as your reading time. And for something a little more freeform, use the time to listen in on a conversation on &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; or Twitter Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONIgIv"&gt;If you’re an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-fitness-plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22320002%2Fwalking-apps-pandemic-strava-footpath-alltrails-seek" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; subscriber, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;Time to Walk&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. Featured celebrities like Dolly Parton share stories, recorded as they walk in places that are meaningful to them. It’s a nice, reflective experience with a diverse range of hosts. You will need a subscription to Apple’s $79 / year fitness service and an Apple Watch, so it’s more likely to be an option if you’re already invested in those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LOz6NS"&gt;Gamify it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f12e8YMF5OIjGprB0TbULvPTCmw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354714/seek.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seek helps you identify local animals and plant life, rewarding you with badges as you observe more species.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WFthGB"&gt;It works on kids and it works on adults: when all else fails, turn it into a game. Tracking walks on &lt;a href="https://www.mapmyrun.com/app"&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/mobile"&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt; can give you that extra sense of accountability and accomplishment when you get back home and tap the “finish” button. It’s a neat little trick that works on my lizard brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJypyF"&gt;Or, do as another of my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues does and take note of local critters and plant life with the &lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app"&gt;Seek app&lt;/a&gt;. It uses your phone’s camera to identify plants, birds, and other kinds of fauna. Best of all, it will keep track of species you’ve indentified and award badges as you identify more. Badges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="asxYQT"&gt;Of course, that’s just the real-life version of the classic catch ‘em all game. Another &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer uses that oldie but goodie &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to keep her neighborhood walks interesting. If you missed its rise in popularity the first time around, here’s the gist: several years ago, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; tricked a bunch of us into going outside to look for AR characters in real-life locations. Once you find them, you can capture them by flinging virtual pokéballs at them on your phone screen. Keep it casual and just see how many different pokémon you encounter and capture on your walk route, or seek out rarer pokémon more aggressively. It’s your world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and nonprofit Common Sense Media team up to provide kid podcast recs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5yi4JxpFcgJiPb1wdfjGZdTZY_s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68928583/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJce2y"&gt;Apple is making it easier for parents to find podcasts to listen to with their kids. The company is teaming up with nonprofit Common Sense Media, which specializes in age-based content reviews, to curate various collections that’ll appear in the Apple Podcasts app in the US and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshowsforkids&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F8%2F22316197%2Fapple-podcasts-common-sense-media-kids-content" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. The initial four themes focus on narrative storytelling, shows that kids themselves recommend, mysteries and dramas, and Common Sense’s “all-time” picks. Programming comes from Tinkercast, American Public Media, WNYC Studios, Rebel Girls, and Nickelodeon, among others, and Common Sense will provide age group recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nljTL"&gt;The collections will be updated monthly with new themes being tied to “important historical and cultural moments,” like Women’s History Month. You’ll see these show suggestions starting today in Apple Podcasts’ main homepage carousel, and then they’ll be available through the Browse tab indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZWk5bi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Four collections will launch today&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wTL4E9"&gt;Podcasts for children have become increasingly popular as the hype around audio grows and parents look for ways to keep their kids entertained without relying on a screen. Common Sense &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/the-best-podcasts-for-kids"&gt;previously published&lt;/a&gt; podcast recommendations, but this new partnership with Apple represents its biggest commitment to audio programming yet. Hot Pod writer Nick Quah &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/kids-podcasts-see-a-bump/"&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt; that kid podcast creators saw huge bumps in listenership at the start of the pandemic. One company, Gen-Z Media, said its show &lt;em&gt;Six Minutes &lt;/em&gt;performed about 2 million downloads a month, but during the pandemic, it was on track for 3 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYSdcw"&gt;Other companies, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200272/spotify-kids-playlist-rollout-app-launch-beta"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436457/amazon-kids-rebranding-freetime"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, place their kid-approved content into separate apps and experiences. Apple seems to think that’s unnecessary for now and that parents can instead rely on themed collections to oversee what their kids enjoy listening to. Apple &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; provide a kid-oriented device experience, but that’s more to give parents control and insight into what their children are consuming than having Apple actually whitelist content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple mixed-reality headset likely coming sometime in 2022, analyst predicts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GM6j7JAfkcWWDb-2Kqv5qjSxH0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925839/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rC9zwg"&gt;Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts in a new research note that Apple will release a “helmet-type” mixed reality headset next year, augmented reality glasses in mid-2025, and an AR contact lens product by 2030-2040, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jLmg9"&gt;“We foresee that the helmet product will provide AR and VR experiences, while glasses and contact lens types of products are more likely to focus on AR applications,” Kuo writes in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAGYsV"&gt;While several prototypes of Apple’s mixed reality headset weigh between 200 and 300 grams, Kuo says, if Apple can solve some technical problems the headset could end up weighing between 100 and 200 grams, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reported. He added that the headset will likely be priced in the $1,000 range in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERZ1mP"&gt;The headset will be able to offer an immersive experience Kuo says will be “significantly better” than those on the market now, with Sony micro-OLED displays, and should be able to run independently of an iPhone, “more like a portable product” than a mobile one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b5abT"&gt;Kuo’s note is mostly in line with other predictions of a headset &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;hitting the market sometime in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but with the price tag closer to $3,000. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that Apple was using a fabric mesh material to reduce the weight of the headset, and had a rendering based on “internal Apple images of a late-stage prototype” that showed what the headset might look like. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple to stop selling iMac Pro base model, which is listed as available ‘while supplies last’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xV0wrJwOqKM0YdwIvufCLd_sflI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68922212/jbareham_171213_2180_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The iMac Pro was first introduced in 2017 | Photo James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crCdu2"&gt;In a sign that the iMac Pro is on the way out, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F6%2F22316831%2Fapple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only model currently available&lt;/a&gt; for purchase on the Apple Store website is the $4,999 base configuration, “while supplies last.” As first &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/06/apple-discontinues-imac-pro-apple-store-says-buy-while-supplies-last/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all build-to-order configurations for the iMac Pro have been removed from Apple’s site (but may still be available at third-party retailers like Amazon). Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; once supplies of the base model run out, iMac Pro will no longer be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FC56W-wMtMpr1uWQt3-A1zlWfTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22349982/buy_imac_pro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Kim Lyons/The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A screengrab of the Apple Store listing for the iMac Pro on March 6th, 2021&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O0NIJ2"&gt;It’s not a huge surprise that Apple may be phasing out the iMac Pro; there have been well-sourced reports that the company will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;introducing a redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt; and doing a revamp of the Mac Pro sometime this year. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported in January&lt;/a&gt; that the overhaul would get rid of the “chin” beneath the screen, and have a flat-back design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3wXiN"&gt;Apple hasn’t officially deemed the iMac Pro as discontinued, but it’s unusual for the company to use “while supplies last” in its product listings. In the meantime, the 27-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353899/apple-imac-2020-webcam-price-specs-release-date-announcement"&gt;iMac introduced in August&lt;/a&gt; is a solid option Apple says is popular among professional iMac users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTSizt"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15741540/apple-imac-pro-announced-price-specs-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;launched the iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 with an eye toward gaming, VR, and high-end editing and graphics work. It was first unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference that year, with Apple touting it as “the most powerful Mac ever,” replacing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission"&gt;outdated Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to run a battery life report on your Windows laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XFhRLRTU_TPv314udxi31dIGur4=/0x0:1401x934/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68920093/2021_03_05_12_57_46_Window.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLEqZP"&gt;When my editor told me about Window’s built-in battery report, my first thought was: “How have I never heard of this before? Also, that sounds pretty useful!” So I looked at the guide he sent (&lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/generate-battery-report-windows-10"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Laptop Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and tried it out. It ended up being just as interesting as it sounded, so I figured I’d share, in case you also haven't come across this handy built-in tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vVa2I"&gt;Windows has been keeping track of how your laptop’s battery is doing since it was installed. The report, which you can run using just two command prompt commands, will show how many cycles you’ve used on your battery and how it’s been used in the past three days. It will also give you a picture of what Windows estimates your battery life &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;be versus what it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBdzup"&gt;So if you’re curious about your battery status or you’ve been noticing that your battery life has been a bit of a drag lately and are wondering if it’s due to neglect or some power virus on your computer sucking back a bunch of juice, this report should let you know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BS1W6n"&gt;First, open the Command Prompt tool. To do that, you can search “CMD” from the Start menu, and click on Command Prompt to open it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hOBzv4"&gt;The report will be spit out as an HTML file, so we’ll want to make sure it’s easy to find. To do that, type in:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="U84nf8"&gt;cd %HOMEPATH%/Desktop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nSCkQd"&gt;This command simply navigates your current directory to your desktop, so when you generate the report, you can find it there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C5yFIG"&gt;To generate the report, type:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0iuN04"&gt;powercfg /batteryreport&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7eeRF7"&gt;This runs the powerconfig tool and tells it to spit out a battery report, which should now be sitting on your desktop as an HTML file. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0l81HX"&gt;Double-click the file to open it up in your browser (or it might ask you which program you want to open the file in, which would be your browser). Now you can see all of that sweet, sweet battery information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2harnZA_gc4oHos7EWjqSZNBLKI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348843/2021_03_05_12_58_45_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery usage graph can tell you how fast your battery drains over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idS43L5kQsUnn7xGLTXvw0Zk0Yg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348842/2021_03_05_12_58_28_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This could help you get an idea of how you use your battery or show your recent computer habits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aou0giOVBFxfinE0FN9vmQdXI-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348845/2021_03_05_12_59_16_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing the design capacity estimate versus your actual time could tell you whether it’s time to replace your battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9ES6Yz"&gt;One caveat: my laptop is used, and as a policy, I completely nuke whatever Windows install is on any laptop I buy, overwriting it with a new one. If you’ve just bought a used laptop and want to know what state the battery is in, you’ll probably want to run this tool &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; wiping Windows, as it seems the cycle count only reflects what’s happened on the current Windows install. My laptop is a 2018 model, and I’m pretty sure it’s gone through more than 177 cycles since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guYuTT"&gt;Even if you’re on a newer install, you can get a general sense of the health by looking at the design capacity and then the full charge capacity to see how different they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUR5NY"&gt;If you’re an Apple user who’s feeling left out, don’t worry: macOS lets you access some battery information, too, though there isn’t as much historical data. To see it, go to the Apple menu in the top left, and click “About This Mac.” Then click the System Report button, and under Hardware, go to Power. There, you can see the cycle count of your battery, its estimated health, and all of your current power settings. To see your battery usage graphs over the past 24 hours or 10 days, go to System Preferences and then Battery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/33ojstncKFLw3Ojat3wySNP4FIE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348871/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_1.15.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has fewer graphs built in, but you can see usage statistics in System Preferences &amp;gt; Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Jay Peters? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzjJVtEToH8cmyxn7XEX72FBRBk=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918189/jpeters_210301_4457_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How he adjusts the workspace to his needs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Wc3oae"&gt;The Verge lives on news, and Jay Peters is one of the news writers who keeps it going — searching out the latest info about what’s going on in technology, entertainment, and culture, and writing it up for the site. As with the rest of us, Jay has been doing most of his work from home over the last year — here’s how he manages it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMtXYq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1wng0"&gt;I’m a news writer here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m fortunate to get to cover all sorts of things in tech, gaming, entertainment, and more. On any given day, I might write about things like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22298495/pokemon-hardware-gadgets-pikachu-poke-ball-mini-camera-consoles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; gadgets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299339/spider-man-movie-title-no-way-home-tom-holland"&gt;Marvel movie titles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291805/chun-li-ryu-fortnite-street-fighter-mortal-kombat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins&lt;/a&gt;, or even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/25/20982612/monopoly-longest-game-ever-edition-hasbro-trolling"&gt;Monopoly Longest Game Ever edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lw0e3Y"&gt;I had a bit of a roundabout path to this job. Out of college, I worked in technology PR, got my start writing about tech at &lt;a href="https://techmeme.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techmeme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in August 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8It11H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq831Q"&gt;Getting the setup to where it is now has taken years. I’ve experimented with different desks, mice, keyboards, laptop stands, monitor arms, and even at one point attached the Nintendo Switch dock to one of the legs of the desk using velcro. And I’m always tinkering with my setup, so anything I have set up now could change down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H20O2r"&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; the desk is, it was a happy coincidence that my current apartment has a corner that’s the perfect size for this desk and the dresser (which holds things like game controllers and my notebook). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlVoCN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What adjustments have you had to make for working at home and how do you deal with distractions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LaKJz"&gt;My wife and I have been working from home since 2017, so our physical work environments haven’t changed much due to the pandemic. Because we live in a studio, though, we have to communicate every day about our schedules and meetings so that we can avoid both being on the phone at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIIsTH"&gt;To keep out distractions, I usually just put in my AirPods Pro, without sound. That’s often enough to block things so I can stay focused. But if I need a little white noise, I turn on this extended YouTube video consisting entirely of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA"&gt;ambient engine noise from the USS Enterprise from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been my go-to for years. And when I feel like working to some music, I have been turning to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0nBYI0owpeY"&gt;lo-fi remixes of video game music&lt;/a&gt; as of late. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWcnWHktfRy_NtgLYHnVYywfnOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347074/jpeters_210226_4457_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jLjAkC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself, which I see is a sitting / standing desk. How did you choose it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ4z71"&gt;It’s a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fview%2Fid%2F233%2Fs%2Fjarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo%2Fcategory%2F3%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fully Jarvis standing desk&lt;/a&gt;. I used a sitting / standing desk at my PR job and got used to being able to switch back and forth, and standing makes me feel less lazy about being parked in front of a computer all day. I also find switching between sitting and standing relieves back pain and helps with a repetitive strain injury (RSI) in my wrists that first flared up a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEmnzy"&gt;One of the best add-ons I got for the desk was the programmable memory unit, which lets me tap a button to adjust the desk to my preferred sitting and standing positions. I also got the casters (wheels) so that I could wheel it over to my and my wife’s lounge chairs, which are right behind the desk. I can bring the desk over, adjust the monitor a bit lower, and then use it to watch movies and play video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gke2wF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you have less desktop space than most of the desks we’ve seen from your colleagues. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esZcpp"&gt;Space is at a premium in my studio, so a smaller desk works better for me right now. I’m also fortunate that I can technically do my entire job with just a laptop, so I don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a bigger desk — though a keyboard, mouse, and monitor make it much easier! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8KMi0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting-looking desk chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="278I3C"&gt;It’s the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fchairs%2Fhag-capisco-chair.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Capisco Chair by HÅG&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought so, too, when I first saw it on Fully’s online store. I had no plans to buy it because of the price, which starts at $829. But I tried it out at the Fully showroom in Portland and it was my favorite chair there, so I sprung for it. Every single day, I’m glad that I did, since I can comfortably sit in it for hours and it helps a lot with my posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wsCwXH"&gt;
&lt;div id="V6qQSL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371531" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bh3IJJ"&gt;
&lt;p id="3IWtjE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KobMOI"&gt;I’ve got a new 13-inch MacBook Air with Apple’s custom M1 chip inside. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;It’s a fantastic machine&lt;/a&gt;. The only upgrade I added was 16GB of RAM. I didn’t add any onboard storage because the majority of my digital life is stored online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fK68T"&gt;The monitor is an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BZNDOO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus VS228H-P with a 21.5-inch screen&lt;/a&gt;. My Amazon account tells me I bought this all the way back in 2015, but even though it’s old, I remain very happy with it. (I will admit that I thought this was a 24-inch screen for, uh, years.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCykmp"&gt;It’s attached to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078455485/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;monitor mount from Huanuo&lt;/a&gt;, and I bought it because it was the tallest one I could find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7wSxQD"&gt;
&lt;div id="7l3USa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10349083" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NXzpJY"&gt;
&lt;p id="gP5TLb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting display setup. How did you decide on it? Does it work well for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5p4S1R"&gt;I use a single monitor because I get distracted too easily if I have more than one. I’d like to upgrade to something bigger or maybe even an ultrawide someday, though (especially now that I know I have a 21.5-inch monitor instead of a 24-inch one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSqIBS"&gt;The extremely tall monitor mount serves two purposes: it helps a lot with my posture and is highly adjustable, which means I can bring it to a lower height when I’m sitting in the chairs behind the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3SYS2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a little about the mouse you have to the right of your keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mIPfn"&gt;It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.contourdesign.com/product/unimouse/"&gt;Contour Unimouse&lt;/a&gt;. My wrists can hurt if I use a “flat” mouse for too long, so I spent a lot of time and money trying out different vertical mice to see which one was the best fit for me. I like the Unimouse a lot because of just how high it angles — the company’s website says it’s 70 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9tpAe"&gt;The mouse pad is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072C93TQL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;VictSing Ergonomic Mouse Pad&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t remember why I picked it over others, but it works great for me and it’s cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ieiC33_m2Ij3HXVTrZYm9jUhWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347059/jpeters_210226_4457_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzULIS40j4oD8nJMgiRVlV0Gpj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347068/jpeters_210226_4457_0010.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nT4SIW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re the second person I’ve seen who uses a split keyboard. Do you find it better than a traditional keyboard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67oxdT"&gt;I do! It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freestyle-Ergonomic-Mechanical-Programmable-Adjustable/dp/B07CX9KQRQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kinesis Freestyle Pro&lt;/a&gt; with the additional tenting accessories and wrist pads. I happily used the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fmicrosoft-sculpt-ergonomic-desktop%2F8xk02kz6k69w%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for years, and also tried other ergonomic keyboards like the &lt;a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2-dvorak/"&gt;Kinesis Advantage2 QD&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/"&gt;ErgoDox EZ&lt;/a&gt;. But the Freestyle Pro just feels the best to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMMkwP"&gt;I also like that I can program specific keys to macros. On the left side of my keyboard, you can see that I have crudely taped scraps of Post-It notes over some of the keys — those scraps are reminders of what I have programmed the keys to do, like Command + L to quickly highlight the link in the URL bar of my browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LRvHCG"&gt;
&lt;div id="g4whKL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371799" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eB4Ssr"&gt;
&lt;p id="oZcvCf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech (headphones, speakers, etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2F70e"&gt;During the workday, my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; hardly ever leave my ears — they’re comfortable, sound fine, and work really well with my Mac and iPhone. I have just one criticism: unlike the original AirPods, the AirPods Pro tend to fall out when I’m talking on calls or eating. Hopefully Apple tweaks the fit of the AirPods Pro a little for the next model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTe2pE"&gt;My webcam is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C920-Pro-Webcam-Black/dp/B00829D0GM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech C920 HD Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It’s great and much better than my MacBook Air’s webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgaftI"&gt;My &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q9JXWTP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C hub is the Totu 13-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. It’s honestly overkill for my needs, but it works fine. Sometimes, though, it emits a dog whistle-pitched squeal that is really annoying. And the charging pad is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CHOETECH-Wireless-Charging-Compatible-Included/dp/B07THTPJFS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=chotech&amp;amp;qid=1614707259&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Choetech charging pad&lt;/a&gt;. It works well enough, though it charges my iPhone very slowly and sometimes requires me to shift my devices around a bit until their charging indicators turn on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu4nTB"&gt;To the left of my desk are my &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/consoles/console/playstation5-digital-edition-console.3005817"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles%2Fxbox-series-x%23purchase#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/system/"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;. I have mostly only owned Nintendo consoles until recently, so I’ve been spending a lot of my pandemic free time catching up on older PlayStation and Xbox games on the PS5 and Series X. (I’m currently tearing my way through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493208/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-ps4-review-vanillaware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) They’re all sitting on an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fmalm-2-drawer-chest-white-stained-oak-veneer-10178601%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310104%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IKEA Malm two-drawer chest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZg5V1"&gt;And throughout the day, I sip water from my trusty &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hydroflask.com%2F21-oz-standard-mouth-w-sport-cap%3Fcolor%3Dblack&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310104%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hydro Flask water bottle&lt;/a&gt;. I swapped the cap for a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083F0JKA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Klean Kanteen Sport cap&lt;/a&gt;, though, which I find leaks less than Hydro Flask’s sport cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DWMdce"&gt;
&lt;div id="S9hyEl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10376102"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e0NMs7"&gt;
&lt;p id="885Vop"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you sent in the photos, you apologized for the cat hair on some of your devices. Tell us about the cat!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wc1Hvu"&gt;Meet Gouda! He’s an eight-year old exotic shorthair and his tongue never goes all the way inside his mouth. But don’t be fooled by his cuteness, he’s full of trouble. He enjoys knocking small objects off counters and waking my wife and me up thirty minutes before the alarm goes off. But we love him dearly anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Find My feature could let you know if you’re the one being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uu22iw8ZbremJQTbBPB24Di5UwQ=/1006x321:2825x1534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68914440/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_12.42.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KuLOxg"&gt;Apple’s Find My app might get a new safety feature to help prevent someone from using the kinds of devices tracked in the app to stalk you instead. “Item Safety Alerts”, spotted in the iOS 14.5 beta, will notify you if an unknown device being tracked on Find My is “moving with you” so you can remove it or disable it, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/04/ios-14-5-beta-3-changes-features-airtags-find-my-item-safety-alerts-video/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fv8saz"&gt;The feature seems designed to counteract a scenario where a Find My-compatible device is hidden in a pocket or bag and then used to track someone’s movements. The Item Safety Alerts setting was found in early versions of iOS 14.3, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/04/apple-brings-back-airtags-anti-stalking-feature"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but was removed until its reappearance in iOS 14.5. The setting is enabled by default in the beta and Apple seems to want it to stay on. If you turn off the setting off, the system will warn you that unknown devices can see your location without you being notified, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1367483996905570317"&gt;Apple blogger Benjamin Mayo&lt;/a&gt; shared on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZW2Rg5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Something I hadn’t considered before: new beta includes a Item Safety setting in Find My. This is how Apple is trying to prevent 'stalking' with AirTags. If someone secretly hides a tag in your possessions, your phone will notice and warn you about it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NVJyAZlthw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NVJyAZlthw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1367483996905570317?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xsUT0a"&gt;Addressing the risk of stalking in Find My is newly important because of Apple’s plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;open up the app to third-party accessories&lt;/a&gt;. Hiding an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook in someone’s bag to track them is difficult, but a small keychain-sized device like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;Tile’s upcoming ultra wideband (UWB) tracker&lt;/a&gt; could be a lot easier. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt; could also be a candidate for misuse, and reintroducing this feature into iOS might mean they’re on their way to release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tXg8jy9k8c0dG_TGibgzY3HIsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345924/iOS_14.5_Beta_3_AirTags_Item_Safety_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My settings screen with ‘Item Safety Alerts’ turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="PyrCdp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10318020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UyRnzj"&gt;While it’s not necessarily as powerful as a GPS beacon with a cellular radio, Apple’s Find My network may have more reach than you’d think. If an Apple device comes near one of these supported trackers, it can update its location, even if the tracker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647146/apple-find-my-app-tracker-friends-iphone-wwdc-2019"&gt;doesn’t have its own connection to the internet&lt;/a&gt;. Tile’s “Community Find” feature works similarly. AirTags could theoretically expand the reach and precision even more, with an added UWB signal in the tag that can make items easier to find behind walls and in other rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54ZRpg"&gt;There are at least a few examples where gadgets like this have been abused: In 2018, a woman in Texas noticed her ex-partner kept showing up at restaurants, other people’s houses, and even an out-of-town trip, without a clear way of knowing where she was, &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/woman-says-ex-used-tile-device-to-stalk-her/3719155/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC 13 &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. She’d later learn her ex had stashed a Tile tracker in the front console of her car, and was using it to find her. A Texas beauty queen shared &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/texas-beauty-queen-claims-stranger-targeted-tracking-device/story?id=38749046"&gt;a similar stalking story in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLyrPz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pceXmG"&gt;iOS 14.5 is in beta right now, and the first beta appeared to have a long-awaited feature: it seemed you would be able to set Spotify and other music services as the default for Siri requests. But Apple has clarified &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the feature doesn’t actually work that way. Instead, selecting a music service for Siri requests is apparently intended to improve Siri’s smarts so that it can better know your audio-listening preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="penUze"&gt;In our testing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify"&gt;the first iOS 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt;, when you would ask Siri to play a song, it would show a list of music services to play a song from. After you made your choice, Siri song requests would then play from the service you selected without requiring you to pick again. But you’re not actually picking a default service, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnCp6L"&gt;“The feature is an attempt to help Siri to learn the listening apps you want to use for different types of audio content — not just music,” according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “Perhaps you want to use Spotify to listen to music, but prefer to keep up with your podcasts in Apple Podcasts or some other third-party podcasts app. And you may want to listen to audiobooks in yet another app.” Apple’s assistant may even ask your preference again in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyDZHb"&gt;Apple also noted to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;that there’s no setting in iOS where you can set your music service default, unlike the options available for setting a default email service or browser. (We also observed this when we tested the feature with the first beta of iOS 14.5.) However, you can still ask that a song play from a specific service as part of your Siri request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAXYrI"&gt;Apple still seems to be tweaking the feature, as it was &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/17/hands-on-with-ios-14-5-beta-2-changes-and-features-video/"&gt;dropped from the second beta&lt;/a&gt; before being reintroduced this week with the third. And because it is still in beta, there’s always the chance the feature could change ahead of the final release. Apple declined to comment if it would appear in the public version of iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELyk0O"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 4th, 7:45PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Apple declined to comment on if the feature would appear in the final version of iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenHaystack is a new open-source tool that lets you create DIY AirTags on Apple’s Find My network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OpenHaystack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWv4gZcgIkCpqVS0u4KSp5A2mEM=/155x0:1748x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911699/OpenHaystack_Screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OpenHaystack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzuy7b"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;promised to open up its Find My app to third-party accessory makers&lt;/a&gt;. But ahead of that, there’s a new tool that will let anybody make their own Bluetooth tracking tag to use with the Find My network so they can track its location. &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack#installation"&gt;OpenHaystack&lt;/a&gt; is a new open-source tool developed by security researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/seemoo/seemoo/index.en.jsp"&gt;Secure Mobile Networking Lab&lt;/a&gt;, who have essentially reverse-engineered the way Apple devices register themselves to the Find My mesh network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEZeQU"&gt;It is, in short, a way to create your own DIY AirTags today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zlLXv"&gt;OpenHaystack works via a custom Mac app that can be used to track the location of custom tags that you create. As of right now, the tool has direct support to make a tracking tag using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910685/bbc-micro-bit-final-design-giving-away-to-kids"&gt;BBC micro:bit mini computer&lt;/a&gt;, though other Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device support could be added by other developers in the future. Once registered on Apple’s Find My network, the OpenHaystack app will be able to report the tag’s location just like Apple’s Find My app works for iPhones and other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvYYZC"&gt;The whole system is a bit of a hack — in the sense that it’s complex, not in the sense that it’s actually hacking anything. It uses a plugin for Apple Mail (which authenticates you as a genuine Apple user) to get the necessary access to Apple’s Find My network to create and locate the keys — so Mail needs to be running for OpenHaystack to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPS6sM"&gt;There don’t appear to be serious security implications for the Find My network itself, either (though the team has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849"&gt;submitted other bug reports to Apple&lt;/a&gt;). That doesn’t mean you should just go ahead and start using OpenHaystack, however. There’s an important disclaimer on the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XbBH78"&gt;OpenHaystack is experimental software. The code is untested and incomplete. For example, OpenHaystack tags using our &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware"&gt;firmware&lt;/a&gt; broadcast a fixed public key and, therefore, are trackable by other devices in proximity (this might change in a future release). OpenHaystack is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GB48S3"&gt;A high-level understanding of how the security model for Find My works also helps understand why OpenHaystack is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToMNk7"&gt;Find My works by using a combination of public and private keys. Any Apple user can access the public keys for devices in the Find My network, but you need the private key in order to actually access location information. This means not even Apple can access your location information without your private keys. The network is possible because Apple devices communally track the public keys, but only users can get location data from private keys.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How OpenHaystack gets on the Find My network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n70MOz"&gt;What OpenHaystack does is create one of those public / private key pairs for your own Bluetooth tag and uses Apple Mail to register it in the Find My network. To Apple, it just looks like another iPhone. The Mac app then accesses the public key database, pairs it with the private key you created, and bam: secure location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byvR9j"&gt;From the way it’s designed, it seems like it might be difficult for Apple to cut off OpenHaystack easily without also cutting off a bunch of older Apple devices. However, it’s also surely true that Apple as a company won’t like the whole thing and may try to find a way to block it. A developer could use the system to create a way to add Android devices to the Find My network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnABVp"&gt;The team behind OpenHaystack has written a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02282"&gt;paper detailing its methods&lt;/a&gt; and disclosing a now-fixed security flaw. It also released the &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware"&gt;source code for its firmware&lt;/a&gt;, which other developers could use to adapt OpenHaystack to other BLE devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhvZGZ"&gt;Apple’s &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; support for third-party accessories is still coming. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-AUC002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22313461%2Fopenhaystack-apple-find-my-network-diy-airtags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin has already announced a set of earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that will support Find My. Given how complex the setup of OpenHaystack is, it probably won’t gain mass adoption. It’s similar in some ways to AirMessage and Beeper, two tools that use Mac utilities to redirect iMessages to Android devices. Apple’s ecosystem is locked down in any number of ways, but the Mac finds a way.&lt;/p&gt;
