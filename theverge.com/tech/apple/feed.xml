    <title>Apple’s Invasion feels like the first chapter of a sci-fi epic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBT6IX4NQ20qtGe-IsN-TpUjf4I=/482x0:3359x1918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258618/Invasion_Photo_011006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9n9RgM"&gt;The first season of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; on Apple TV Plus feels a little incomplete. Across its 10 episodes, which chart a handful of humans grappling with an alien invasion, the story slowly teases out the reality of what’s happening. There are hints here and there — a haunting artificial voice, a mysterious alien-killing weapon, a kid with seizures that may or may not show the future — but the biggest reveal of all doesn’t even happen until the very last shot in the final episode. It still managed to pull me in — but that pull has a lot to do with potential. Rather than standing on its own, the initial season of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; feels like the first chapter of a much grander science fiction epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83ezo3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; gets off to a slow start&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most stories about an alien invasion, which tend to focus on the alien part, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; lingers on human trauma. Early on, there’s barely even a mention of the invading extraterrestrials. Instead,&lt;em&gt; Invasion&lt;/em&gt;’s global story tracks a handful of different threads spread across the world, which ultimately end up loosely connected. Each has some tie to the otherworldly events: there’s a young boy in London who is prone to seizures that may be connected to the invasion; a family from Long Island that’s struggling with infidelity and also happens to possibly have a weapon that can kill the aliens; a space engineer in Japan who seems to be the only one able to communicate with them; and an American soldier who is separated from his squad in Afghanistan after what appears to be an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDs0Zv"&gt;The show does a great job of making you care about these characters, mostly because you spend so much time with them. You understand why the engineer is working tirelessly to find a stranded astronaut after lots of long, heartfelt scenes revealing their secret relationship. Likewise, while the soldier comes across as a jerk initially, his slowly revealed backstory ultimately turns him into a sympathetic figure. There’s lots of great character development going on, but it also requires patience since it takes quite a while to get to the actual aliens. For the first half of the season, it’s mostly just hints that there’s something going on beyond a natural disaster of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTc2-wBP-YFwG77benxDHPBkg08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079599/Invasion_Photo_011001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pzxnjQ"&gt;This all means that when the aliens do finally appear, it’s a huge deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776188/invasion-apple-tv-plus-episode-6-aliens"&gt;The reveal is great&lt;/a&gt; and neatly changes the tone of the show. From then on, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; becomes something different, balancing out its character drama (which never fully goes away, thankfully) with some intriguing alien mysteries and the flat-out horror of dealing with the invaders. There’s a terrifying scene in a secluded house, where a family tries to sneak away from one of the spiked blob creatures; later, we see the soldier making his way through a war-torn hospital amidst an infestation as if this was a first-person &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vgcp5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You never get much in the way of answers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AXaQXi"&gt;What you don’t get are much in the way of answers. There are some small revelations, like when you learn that the London teen had visions of the invasion before it happened or when it appears that the Japanese researcher discovers how the aliens communicate. But nothing is ever clear. Even when it seems like the aliens have been defeated, the show throws another twist at you. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Mystery is important, and those unknowns are part of what has kept me coming back. But the result is that season 1 doesn’t feel like a complete story, with its own distinct arc. It’s 10 episodes of setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ9WrR"&gt;The good news is that Apple revealed earlier this week that &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is coming back for a second season, with co-creator Simon Kinberg saying they would be “expanding our universe in the most intimate and epic ways.” And after a full season of setting things up, I’m anxious to see where it’s finally going.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s concessions in China reportedly include a secret $275 billion deal and one odd change in Maps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="China Development Forum (CDF) 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-g6pMQeaQtsPNtqxMwj3xHnbY0=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70257237/937560290.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook attends China Development Forum (CDF) 2018&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Visual China Group via Getty Images/Visual China Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uuy4e9"&gt;Tim Cook has pushed Apple’s value within close range of $3 trillion, and a lot of that has to do with the former operations lead’s ability to manage a relationship with China, where many of its products are made and, increasingly, many of them are sold. A report this week from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; relies on unnamed sources and internal documents to peel back some of the details about Apple’s ties with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tTir7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 1,250-word MOU between Apple and China’s National Development and Reform Commission reportedly runs for five years and accounted for $275 billion in spending&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1kBY4"&gt;That includes a request Apple reportedly received in 2014 or 2015 about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senkaku_Islands"&gt;a small group of uninhabited islands&lt;/a&gt; that China and Japan apparently have a dispute over in terms of who owns them. Going by either the Senkaku Islands or the Diaoyu Islands, depending on which side of the argument you’re taking, they inspired a request from China to members of the Maps team to make them appear larger, even when viewers are zoomed out on the map. According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, not only did Apple eventually make the change, but even today, for viewers using its map from within China, the islands are still shown at a larger scale than the territories around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Satellite views of the Senkaku Islands" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYck_ik3Kilhuzno12VIIj354wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080195/588404986.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A satellite image of the Senkaku Islands located in the East of China on April 01, 2016 in Japan. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cVgQYI"&gt;The report also details disputes over everything from iTunes and iCloud to Apple Pay. The figure that looms over everything is a 1,250-word memorandum of understanding that &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says Tim Cook signed during a publicized trip to China in 2016. The way it’s laid out, Cook went to China because of repeated regulatory actions affecting Apple’s business. By signing a five-year agreement (with an option to extend to a sixth year) promising investments, business deals, and training in China, worth an estimated $275 billion, the aim was to avoid further disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj5SPP"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; has confirmed from its sources, that seems to have mostly held true. The report points out &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-becomes-largest-smartphone-brand-china-october-2021/"&gt;data from the analysts at Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; who said that in October, Apple became the largest smartphone brand in China, a title it hadn’t held in six years. Meanwhile, Apple has built new R&amp;amp;D centers in the country and started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;storing iCloud data for Chinese users there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWxick"&gt;However, that relationship also has downsides, with critics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18020508/how-china-complicates-apples-chest-thumping-about-privacy"&gt;questioning the company’s commitment to privacy&lt;/a&gt; — its Private Relay feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523871/china-private-relay-regulatory-reasons-not-launching-great-firewall-internet-censorship"&gt;will not be available in China&lt;/a&gt; — and business dealings with companies accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;links to Uyghur forced labor&lt;/a&gt;. That’s before we mention the other visible concessions that harken back to that decision about the disputed islands, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632029/apple-engraving-filter-censorship-keyword-china-hong-kong-taiwan"&gt;the numbers Apple won’t let you engrave on an iPad in China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728257/apple-quran-majeed-app-removed-china"&gt;takedowns of certain apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFqi7c"&gt;After the report surfaced, the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3159087/apples-reported-us275-billion-china-investment-questioned-state-media"&gt;&lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports (via &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/12/09/chinese-media-downplaying-apples-reported-275b-deal-with-the-country"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that a state-run tabloid in China referred to it as “McCarthyism,” claiming it was an attack “clearly driven by the ‘political correctness’ of Sinophobia.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony was bringing PlayStation Now to mobile phones, according to a confidential Apple presentation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PS2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CpfySOJughyosDwe9Z5uaGatSjQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70257065/vpavic_191126_untitled_0011_2_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cB1Lly"&gt;In 2017 — long before Apple declared that cloud gaming could only exist on the iPhone if it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;jumped through gigantic hoops&lt;/a&gt; — Sony was preparing to launch its PlayStation Now cloud gaming service on mobile phones, a confidential document reveals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocH39i"&gt;It could have been the single biggest expansion of Sony’s PS Now game service in years. Originally, the service streamed PS2 and PS3 games to smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and the PS3 and PS Vita, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14626676/playstation-now-discontinued-ps3-vita-smart-tvs"&gt;cut off all those original platforms in late 2017&lt;/a&gt; (coincidence?) to focus on the PlayStation 4 and Windows PC instead. While it recently added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397555/playstation-now-1080p-streaming-support-resolution"&gt;1080p streaming&lt;/a&gt; and a PS5 client, it’s never been offered on Android, iOS, or Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwJK83"&gt;But according to a confidential document unearthed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from the&lt;em&gt; Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple had insider knowledge of Sony’s upcoming launch. Apple had heard about a “[not-yet-announced] mobile extension of an existing streaming service for PlayStation users, streaming access to over 450+ PS3 games to start, with PS4 games to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNqD5z"&gt;A handful of PS4 games launched on PlayStation Now in July 2017, but the presentation notes that the service is “only PS3 games right now,” suggesting Apple got tipped off about more than just the move to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQIpa4A3pK-VvvsiYvmq1HnKaDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080005/ps_now_mobile.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;PlayStation Now is listed as a “mobile” subscription&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;in a document labeled “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL — ATTORNEY’S EYES ONLY”.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iINjJs"&gt;Why did Apple bring this up? It’s smack dab in the middle of an explanation of Apple’s plans to launch its own game subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, which wouldn’t be announced until two years later. At the time, Apple was preparing to target 30 top game studios and ask for as many as “a few hundred titles” to add.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qmpcx0LbKMEsJ6luj_yXTZMCeag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080073/apple_games_subs.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple describes its “game subscription service,” which would launch as Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqhn65"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;I wrote that Sony squandered the opportunity to be a leader in cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;, despite being the first major company to recognize its potential, buying &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of the early startups (Gaikai and OnLive) that proved out the idea. But despite Apple’s resistance to cloud gaming on the App Store — read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826297/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-streaming-exclusives-iphone-ipad-gamepas"&gt;my new story about what happened with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; — there’s an intriguing possibility that Sony isn’t giving up yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816087/sony-playstation-5-game-subscription-service-xbox-games-pass-now-spartacus"&gt;Sony reportedly now has a Project Spartacus&lt;/a&gt; that would bundle its cloud gaming service with a PlayStation Plus subscription, and it would bring original PS1 games and “eventually” PS5 games to the service too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRSIgj"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Jason Schreier’s scoop for &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t mention mobile phones at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmK2x1"&gt;While it’s possible Sony read the room and decided it wasn’t worth fighting Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17392470/apple-rejects-valve-steam-link-app-store-ios-game-steaming"&gt;the way Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft, and Google did for mobile access, it might also be that Sony decided to focus on selling more consoles instead — if you do have a PS4 or PS5 in your house, the company’s PS Remote Play app already lets you stream it (perhaps even &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2021/09/14/ps4-remote-play-ps5-games-over-mobile-data-update-download-broadcast-ios-android-iphone/"&gt;over cellular&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429291/sony-ps5-remote-play-dualsense-apple-mac-iphone-ipod-ipad-apple-tv"&gt;to a wide array of Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Android. You can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;stream a new PS5 to your old PS4&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a new lease on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5t8Yy"&gt;Sony wouldn’t comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Apple employee says she won’t withdraw her labor board complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DN-viq88iRgLXKnBD9TUqV9LjhM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251636/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhlsXd"&gt;Former Apple employee Cher Scarlett says the company didn’t adequately live up to its half of a settlement, so she won’t withdraw her complaint to the National Labor Relations Board as agreed, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__8jy2n3rr1sb"&gt;Scarlett says that her settlement with Apple required it to post “a company-wide memo clarifying employee rights including discussing pay &amp;amp; working conditions,” “in a prominent and visible location on the People site.” She says that the company did post a notice to its site, but that it was only up during the week that Apple employees were given off for Thanksgiving. “I’d argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible,” Scarlett &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032"&gt;tweeted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyTsr3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Despite the fact that there was no requirement for a time period, the agreement clearly stated "in a prominent and visible location on the People site".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible.&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f6ksV6"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, Apple also ignored changes to the settlement requested by the NLRB. Scarlett &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22788245/cher-scarlett-apple-nlrb-settlement-leaves-company-appletoo-pay-equity"&gt;left the company in November&lt;/a&gt;, after filing the complaint that accused the company of engaging “in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity.” While at the company, she worked to let employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;discuss and gather data about pay equity&lt;/a&gt; and was part of #AppleToo, a campaign about the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;failure to deal with harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has reportedly closed an Apple Store in Texas due to a COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GlyHyyF7X96_IbKY3YI_o7wC6Yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251538/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me4IJw"&gt;Apple closed one of its Southlake, Texas retail stores Wednesday after many staff members contracted COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-store-texas-closes-covid-outbreak-rcna8000"&gt;according to NBC News&lt;em&gt;’ &lt;/em&gt;Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. A manager told employees Wednesday that 22 staffers “have shared that they’re positive for COVID-19,” NBC News reported, and four of the store’s 151 employees reported positive cases right after Black Friday. The store will be closed through Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnEhom"&gt;NBC News’ report highlights a few worrying trends about the Southlake location. One employee said they had previously raised concerns about being unable to keep social distancing. He and another employee said the store was packed “shoulder to shoulder” on Black Friday. And a manager at the Southlake store apparently had asked employees to come even if they had called in sick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ftJJuM"&gt;NBC spoke with four current and former employees at the Southlake store who said they’ve received calls from their manager encouraging them to come to work, even when they called out sick. In two of these cases, the employee had taken the Covid-19 survey and the results said not to come in. The manager did not respond to requests for comment from NBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N5atlM"&gt;Apple’s official policy requires retail staffers to wear masks and to take a COVID-19 survey before they go to work. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;must also be tested for COVID-19 frequently&lt;/a&gt;: unvaccinated workers must be tested twice per week and vaccinated workers tested once per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrpsZe"&gt;The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Schiffer reported this month for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that many of Apple’s frontline workers find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic"&gt;working conditions to be untenable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDHSeq"&gt;Most of Apple’s corporate employees will return to the offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;in a hybrid work pilot&lt;/a&gt; beginning February 1st. The company originally announced its hybrid work plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; with the intent to return in September, but that was delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;to January&lt;/a&gt; and then to February. Facebook parent company Meta has also recently updated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1469042247450513410"&gt;its return to work policies&lt;/a&gt;. Offices will fully reopen on January 31st, but staff will be able to defer coming back by three to five months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhones will be able to give owners a detailed history of what parts were replaced</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtlW9ELdJJfE6WjGpt5djeHB1uw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249538/akrales_170620_1794_0029.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tG9xHD"&gt;Apple is about to add a new feature to iPhones informing users if the device was previously repaired and whether a genuine screen or battery was used (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/ios-15-2-shows-a-service-history-of-repaired-parts-in-your-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;via 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212878"&gt;parts and service history&lt;/a&gt; section will appear (under Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; About) with the upcoming iOS 15.2 update for iPhone — providing some insight and peace of mind for buyers of used or refurbished iPhones hoping to get a proper quality OEM unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtEGWM"&gt;The new update expands on a previous feature that can tell if a screen or battery was not genuine, now adding them in one place and even including a date on when the service was performed. Since the release of the iPhone 11, Apple started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884287/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-display-screen-replacement-verification-warning"&gt;including a warning&lt;/a&gt; when an aftermarket (ungenuine) screen was installed. Now iPhones as old as XR models can warn if a battery is ungenuine, while iPhone 12 and 13 can call out more including the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEQGbR"&gt;Earlier versions of iOS on the iPhone 13 threatened to make screen repairs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764251/iphone-13-screen-replacements-break-face-id-microsolder"&gt;more difficult&lt;/a&gt;, requiring microsoldering to avoid a warning label and deactivated Face ID sensors. iOS 15.2  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786274/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes"&gt;updates the process&lt;/a&gt; to allow repairs by users or a third-party shop without a complaint from the device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYqxLcQmlwwcUAJm69RK6XKJJzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075322/ios15_2_repair.001.jpeg.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15.2 with new Parts and Service History section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6HOm0z"&gt;Buying and selling used iPhones is a huge market, but it can be scary not knowing if a device will have a low-quality aftermarket&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;battery that might overheat — or annoying if the screen you get has terrible colors because it’s not really OLED (when it should be). This could happen if a repair was performed by a third-party shop that is not in Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20838307/apple-iphone-repairs-parts-independent-shops"&gt;independent repair program&lt;/a&gt; (IRP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EitIXY"&gt;With the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22787245/apple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy"&gt;Self Service Repair&lt;/a&gt; from Apple, customers will have a means of getting genuine parts and repairing iPhones at home. Since this method of service is supported by Apple, newer iPhones on iOS 15.2 repaired through self-service will acknowledge that a repair was done and the parts are genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeoeUB"&gt;Trading in or reselling iPhones might get more difficult, though — if aftermarket parts were used, then companies and independent buyers now have the leverage to quote lower values if a repair is reported in settings. This can lead to very &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368541/apple-trade-in-phobio-macbook-white-spots"&gt;frustrating situations&lt;/a&gt; especially if a phone needs to be sent in for inspection to confirm a trade-in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9Jrql"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZGJla"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AR headset reportedly uses 3D sensors for hand tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVPmyMe9aWsqzwUyemG7vkI4iDY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248440/acastro_170731_1777_0005_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkbnAo"&gt;Apple’s widely rumored upcoming mixed reality headset will make use of 3D sensors for advanced hand tracking, according to analyst Ming-chi Kuo, whose latest research note has been reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/apple-ar-vr-hand-gesture-interface/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/kuo-apples-mixed-reality-headset-to-have-advanced-hand-gesture-detection/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The headset is said to have four sets of 3D sensors, compared to the iPhone’s single unit, which should give it more accuracy than the TrueDepth camera array currently used for Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Cerzh"&gt;According to Kuo, the structured light sensors can detect objects as well as “dynamic detail change” in the hands, comparable to how Face ID is able to figure out facial expressions to generate Animoji. “Capturing the details of hand movement can provide a more intuitive and vivid human-machine UI,” he writes, giving the example of a virtual balloon in your hand flying away once the sensors detect that your fist is no longer clenched. Kuo believes the sensors will be able to detect objects from up to 200 percent further away than the iPhone’s Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bcjJHE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oculus Quest 2 review: better, cheaper VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ycJiW2"&gt;Meta’s Quest headsets are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21260554/oculus-quest-anniversary-hand-tracking-third-party-games-beat-saber-tracks"&gt;capable of hand tracking&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not a core feature of the platform and it relies on conventional monochrome cameras. Kuo’s note doesn’t mention whether Apple’s headset will use physical controllers as well as hand tracking. Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in January that Apple was testing hand tracking for the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PX4ay3"&gt;Kuo also this week provided some &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/kuo-apple-ar-vr-headset/"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; on what could come after Apple’s first headset. While he expects the first model to weigh in at around 300-400 grams (~0.66-0.88lbs), a “significantly lighter” second-generation model with an updated battery system and faster processor is said to be planned for 2024. The first model will arrive sometime next year, according to Kuo, and Apple reportedly expects it to sell about three million units in 2023. That suggests the initial product may well be expensive and aimed at early adopters. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s upcoming macOS 12.1 update will fix the MacBook Pro’s notch and menu bar issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A66lvRvT5xwTQrQMiBwwgAfDcHQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70247196/akrales_211020_4803_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7MdMDA"&gt;Apple’s upcoming macOS 12.1 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"&gt;will fix some odd interactions&lt;/a&gt; between its new MacBook Pros’ notched displays and menu bar apps, which should no longer be blocked behind the notch, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/macos-12-1-fixes-notch-obscuring-menu-bar-icons/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1U6zX"&gt;Previously, some users had reported issues where menu bar icons could end up getting pushed behind the notch in the event that too many were open. Or, as Apple’s changelog describes the issue, prior to macOS 12.1, “[menu] bar extras may be obscured by the camera housing on 2021 MacBook Pro computers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ttbR5Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple seems to have forgotten it built a notch in the MacBook Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="CRGxsh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WTF HAHAHAHA HOW IS THIS SHIPPABLE? WHAT IS THIS?! &lt;a href="https://t.co/epse3Cv3xF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/epse3Cv3xF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Quinn Nelson (@SnazzyQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143510111059968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VtDbB8"&gt;The bug admittedly was rare to begin with, requiring that users had enough menu bar icons (referred to by Apple as “menu bar extras”) to reach from the right side of the display to the notch’s location, but particularly large menu bar apps (like iStat Menus) could accomplish the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ula5Va"&gt;In addition to fixing the menu bar / notch bug, the new update also brings a few other issues, including HDR problems with YouTube and MagSafe bugs on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7IiAG"&gt;macOS 12.1 is still in beta, but given that the company has seeded the release candidate version of the software to developers, the update (and the bug fix for the notch issues) should be rolling out to all users in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will pay for Jennifer Lawrence to play Elizabeth Holmes in new Theranos film</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortune Global Forum - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pxoo7k-7HQrQf9OJFIaNGabPaLA=/0x0:2627x1751/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70246655/495430024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for Fortune&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L3yGHn"&gt;Apple says it will produce a movie about former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, with Jennifer Lawrence of &lt;em&gt;Hunger Games &lt;/em&gt;fame in the starring role. The movie, to be directed by Adam McKay, will be based on the bestselling book &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup&lt;/em&gt; by former &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter John Carreyrou. He &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;wrote the first news stories&lt;/a&gt; detailing Theranos’ problems, even as the company and Holmes were being lauded in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfmkHy"&gt;Holmes is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22792606/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-witness-stand-surprise"&gt;currently on trial&lt;/a&gt; facing 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud after it was discovered that Theranos’ blood testing technology didn’t meet the standards it claimed to investors. At the time of its unraveling, Theranos was valued at $9 billion, and Holmes was labeled the youngest self-made billionaire and featured on &lt;em&gt;Fortune’s&lt;/em&gt; 40 under 40 list. Later in 2016, Holmes &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2016/03/30/most-disappointing-leaders/"&gt;was named&lt;/a&gt; one of the world’s most disappointing leaders. She faces up to 20 years in prison, if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VO77Ec"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Elizabeth Holmes is on trial for fraud over her time at Theranos ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684354/elizabeth-holmes-trial-wire-fraud-theranos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OJkkmb"&gt;The film is yet another confirmed project about the Theranos scandal. Earlier this year, Hulu confirmed that it would be making &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/amanda-seyfried-elizabeth-holmes-the-dropout-hulu-theranos-kate-mckinnon-1234723500/"&gt;a docuseries&lt;/a&gt; starring Amanda Seyfried.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xaFk7o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 9th, 9:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this story stated that Adam McKay was the creator of Succession, he is not. McKay is an executive producer. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s excellent Smart Thermostat is even more affordable today </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-rikk4ve-Dbaex2opcFzYLFT5Tg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244108/jtuohy_211115_4885_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the Alexa app to control Amazon’s Smart Thermostat, which is currently enjoying its first discount.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="85aJOu"&gt;Even without a discount attached to it, Amazon’s surprisingly great Smart Thermostat is a good deal in itself. After our reviewer spent a decade testing almost every smart thermostat since the launch of the Nest Learning Thermostat, she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; it to be one of the best yet. That’s saying a lot, and it’s pretty impressive given this is an affordable smart thermostat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJWOjc"&gt;The thermostat is discounted for the first time today, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $47.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; — a 20 percent discount on its typical $59.99. Built in collaboration with Resideo, the makers of Honeywell Home Thermostat Technology, this gadget is capable of learning and adapting to your schedule, just like more expensive thermostats out there. With the price in mind, it does lack some features. Perhaps the most egregious omission is that it doesn’t integrate with platforms or voice assistants besides Alexa. Yet, if you’re looking for a good basic thermostat with which you can control the temperature of your home (even while traveling), this is definitely worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="took9t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SE0OPc"&gt;Sonos is offering great deals on its refurbished products through December 31st. You can buy, for example, the latest generation of the Sonos One for &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeDeals120821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fone-b-stock.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $100 less than its full $219 retail cost when purchased new. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/18/16490866/sonos-one-speaker-review-alexa"&gt;first-generation&lt;/a&gt; is also on sale for $129, but lacks Bluetooth Low Energy support, has a slower processor, and comes with less memory than the second-gen. Meanwhile, the first-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Sonos Beam&lt;/a&gt; soundbar is selling for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8532386-11556673?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fbeam-white-b-stock.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$259&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to $399, the price when purchased new. While it lacks Dolby Atmos support like the second-gen model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; it’s still a competent smart speaker that shares many features in common with the newer version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZAD3l"&gt;All of the discounted refurbished products will arrive in a box with the original accessories and cables. They’ve also been certified directly from Sonos, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21530290/refurbished-tech-products-gadgets-where-to-buy-amazon-ebay"&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; the company has tested and given each an internal and external cleaning and inspection. Each product also comes with a one-year warranty and a 45-day money-back guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N3fELm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="TMUytT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDSO0B"&gt;If you prefer earbuds to bulkier headphones, you might want to grab the second-gen Apple AirPods at Amazon since they’re just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99&lt;/a&gt;. That matches its second-lowest price after we saw the earbuds drop to $89 during early Black Friday sales. It’s also a lower price than what we saw on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when they were selling for around $110. Typically around $129, this model offers excellent wireless performance, reliable battery life, and is easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zVYh9F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y89YAm"&gt;If you’ve got a little more cash to spare, and you’re in the market for a pair of excellent over-ear headphones, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals120821"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; is bundling Sony’s WH-1000XM4 with Mophie’s Power Boost XXL 20,800mAh battery power bank for just $248. That matches the Black Friday and Cyber Monday price many retailers sold the $349.99 headphones for just by themselves. Mophie’s power bank typically sells for $39.95 itself, so this bundle is valued at around $390. Plus, the bundle also includes a small microfiber cleaning cloth to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6501a"&gt;As we noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; (and as you’ve probably read in our deals coverage many times before), Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM4 boast the company’s best noise-canceling capabilities yet. We gave the headphones a 9/10 partly because of it, along with their stellar comfort, sound quality, and the fact they also let you connect to two Bluetooth sources simultaneously (this was missing in the XM3). Meanwhile, Mophie’s portable power bank comes with two USB-A ports so you can charge your headphones and phone simultaneously, and it charges via Micro USB. The company claims as well that its 20,800mAh battery offers up to 77 hours of extra battery life, but note we haven’t tested this product, so we can’t confirm if this is truly the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQfWTW"&gt;Of course, if you prefer to just buy the headphones by themselves, many are still selling them for just $248, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2gyfQV3mV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="90yl6V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907261"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezhNoP"&gt;Govee’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Immersion TV LED backlights&lt;/a&gt; are fun, colorful lights that can make watching movies and gaming look more immersive. They sync to the colors on your screen (it supports 55- to 65-inch TVs) to make it appear as if its bezels have disappeared and the colors are expanding onto your walls. In other words, they’ll make for some pretty cool holiday gifts. Govee’s backlighting kit released in 2020 is back on sale at Amazon. For a limited time, you can pick one up for just $63.99 once you clip the $20 off coupon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the product’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsGMEZ"&gt;Govee is also selling this product direct &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.govee.com%2Fproducts%2Fimmersion-tv-backlights&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F8%2F22822289%2Famazon-thermostat-sonos-samsung-980-pro-razer-kishi-airpods-govee-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $62.99&lt;/a&gt; as a part of its holiday sale, which is a little cheaper. Still, if you prefer to shop from Amazon or are a Prime member, the Amazon deal could be the better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="plsQMm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10681491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zH8SZ"&gt;For those still trying to nab a PlayStation 5 — or for those lucky enough to already have one — one of our picks for the best SSDs compatible with the PS5 is currently at its best price ever. Normally $229.99, Amazon is selling the 1TB version of Samsung’s 980 Pro for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLX7TNT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169.99&lt;/a&gt; instead. That’s a $60 discount on Samsung’s blazingly fast SSD, which is one of the few kinds of drives on the market that meet Sony’s performance requirements. It’s also compatible with PC, though you’ll only get its advertised PCIe 4.0 speeds if you have a compatible motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyhOxD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="NPAcho"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The PlayStation 5 will be available for Walmart Plus members on Wednesday","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821037/ps5-playstation-5-restock-available-walmart-plus-queue-deal-sale"},{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall isn’t worthwhile at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VzJPoI"&gt;Shifting away from SSDs to gaming controllers, Razer’s Kishi is a great gift for gamers on the go traveling this holiday season. You can clamp it onto your Android phone and easily transform it into a Nintendo Switch lookalike. It’s also compatible with many games available on a variety of cloud-based gaming platforms, including Google Stadia, Microsoft xCloud, and more. It’s typically a bit pricey at $79.99, but right now both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9PMTEDGaM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086X8DHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are taking nearly 50 percent off, selling it for $44.99 instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wf8m22"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882522"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CH57MS"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other notable deals happening:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="title"&gt;If you’re an iPhone 12 Mini owner, Amazon is selling Apple’s black MagSafe leather case for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5PWGZY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$23.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $59 — a 59 percent discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CUE8yB"&gt;Right now, PayPal is selling a $100 GameStop gift card for &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/gifts/brands/gamestopdecgood"&gt;$90&lt;/a&gt; that you can also use at ThinkGeek, EB Games, Babbage’s, and Planet X stores. It’s a good chance to save a little on a holiday gift or while treating yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OKgxx0"&gt;Amazon’s also offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/epicdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;variety of deals&lt;/a&gt; on gift cards, like this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vudu-Gift-Cards-Email-Delivery/dp/B09J7SKH8N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 Vudu card for $40&lt;/a&gt; when you use the code &lt;strong&gt;VUDU&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="o4qnWv"&gt;Costco members can get one of Microsoft’s latest Xbox wireless controllers in white &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-wireless-controller-robot-white.product.100735150.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $30&lt;/a&gt; (normally around $55).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="4VjdQW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rThZTp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 8th, 11:45AM PT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;An earlier version of this story claimed that the Amazon Smart Air Thermostat was “built in collaboration with Honeywell Home.” It was not. It was instead built in collaboration with Resideo, the makers of Honeywell Home Thermostat Technology. We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlP4ir"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZN9Jk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yvs6YS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
