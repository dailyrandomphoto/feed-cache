    <title>SharePlay is now available on Macs as part of the latest macOS Monterey update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-VtpFJH48wkOgRJHiBnaNot5ctU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267350/akrales_211028_4820_0680.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a8AOYW"&gt;Apple has brought SharePlay to the Mac as part of macOS Monterey 12.1, which was released Monday. With SharePlay, you can now enjoy entertainment like movies, music, and games synchronized with your friends over FaceTime while on your Mac. (You can see a list of &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1583059388"&gt;some supported apps here&lt;/a&gt;.) And if you want to share your screen with your group, SharePlay supports that as well. My colleague Monica Chin ran &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;into some issues&lt;/a&gt; with SharePlay on Mac while the feature was in beta, however, so hopefully it works more smoothly now that it’s available widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rvlAc"&gt;macOS Monterey 12.1 adds some features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;also found in iOS 15.2&lt;/a&gt;. There’s the new Apple Music Voice Plan, a more affordable tier of the music streaming service that lets you access music with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734185/new-apple-music-voice-plan-price-features-app"&gt;just your voice and Siri&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to designate people as Legacy Contacts who can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;access your iCloud data when you die&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple will now let parents enable warnings that appear when their children receive or send iMessages with nude photos.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLznrt"&gt;The new version of Monterey is still missing one big feature, though. Universal Control, which lets you use one mouse and keyboard across Macs and iPads, was supposed to launch this fall, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832765/universal-control-apple-macos-monterey-ipad-delay-spring"&gt;Apple delayed it Monday to “this spring.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The MacBook Air with M1 processor is back down to $800 for today only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vO1qpXj53nwSXQfxIsb8Wy2UZZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266487/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Air with M1 processor first debuted just over one year ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ak2488"&gt;The MacBook Air with M1 processor, our top pick for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;the best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, is currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcsdQZjSND" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 off at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This brings the popular laptop from Apple down to its historical low price of $799.99. We have often seen this MacBook Air discounted by $50, $100, and even occasionally $150, but this level of sale is much less frequent, and as good as it gets. Best Buy’s deal on the MacBook Air is only running for today — scheduled to expire when it strikes midnight on December 14th — or while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuNF5X"&gt;The configuration of MacBook Air on offer today is the late 2020 model with the Apple-made M1 CPU, outfitted with the base-level 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM. You have your choice of colors from its three options of space gray, gold, and silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOfFBV"&gt;There are few other laptops as capable in this price range as the MacBook Air, whether you’re dabbling in productivity and work, everyday home and on-the-go computer use, or even light content creation. Its battery life is also exceptional. The biggest knock against this laptop — dongle life aside — is the awful webcam quality. Though there are worse problems to have, especially if you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;put some of that money saved toward a webcam&lt;/a&gt; that is much better than the cameras built into any laptop. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal Control won’t be coming to macOS Monterey until sometime this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8T_kPXe_J0aSmUGfYN4cUfZWmvc=/0x8:1630x1095/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266227/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_7.37.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vpqLBu"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;Universal Control feature&lt;/a&gt; has been delayed again, with the company’s website updating today to note that the drag-and-drop feature won’t be arriving until sometime “this spring,” as spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSWUpdates/status/1470468525613539334"&gt;the AppleSWUpdates Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIpYIX"&gt;Universal Control was originally announced alongside macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15 at WWDC back in June, but the feature — which promises to bridge Apple’s Mac and iPad devices, allowing users to use a single mouse and keyboard for both and to drag and drop content between the two — has yet to materialize in either macOS or iPadOS. Apple hasn’t even started offering Universal Control to developers or beta users to test yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kNcuje"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Universal Control on macOS Monterey works","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Nh2JJn"&gt;Apple had previously updated its website in October to indicate that Universal Control &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733044/macos-universal-control-later-this-fall-monterey-feature-delay"&gt;would be available “later this fall,”&lt;/a&gt; but with the official end of fall just a few days away, it seems that the company is no longer going to hit that estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1oyk3J9lwYF7uL2j0OVs-ksrusQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085160/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_2.14.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mLD03M"&gt;Universal Control isn’t the only major feature to have missed the initial release for Apple’s 2021 software updates. SharePlay, one of the company’s marquee software features this year, wasn’t available at the launch of either iOS 15 or macOS Monterey (the feature only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;arrived on iOS on October 25th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-macos-monterey-12-1/"&gt;just hit macOS today&lt;/a&gt;), while other more minor features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;also failed to make the cut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 15.2 with App Privacy Report, Digital Legacy, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r63_BgzBE2ppZdSgP2zSzs7Vwfk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265497/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should now be able to download iOS 15.2&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjCL3h"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15.2, which includes a ton of features and fixes, has started to become roll out to iPhones after an extensive beta period. According to Apple’s release notes, posted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2-watchos-8-3-and-tvos-15-2-to-all-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the update includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="txvrW9"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;The Digital Legacy program&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22812264/digital-legacy-death-estate-google-apple-how-to"&gt;designate who gets access to your data&lt;/a&gt; when you die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1i2stA"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;The App Privacy Report&lt;/a&gt;, which shows what permissions your apps use, and what websites they connect to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TqxDX0"&gt;Apple’s $4.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822631/apple-music-voice-plan-ios-15-2-release-candidate"&gt;voice-only plan for Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Jr09g"&gt;A fix for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;somewhat confusing state of the 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2XMGjZ"&gt;The update also brings with it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;some of Apple’s communication safety features&lt;/a&gt;, one of which will blur iMessages sent to children that an on-device scan tags as potentially being explicit. The feature was part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;Apple’s controversial suite of changes&lt;/a&gt; meant to fight child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which involved on-device scanning of photos uploaded to iCloud, as well as automatically notifying parents if their child chose to view pictures tagged as inappropriate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ItxICe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kb2zI4"&gt;Apple has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delayed the photo library scanning feature&lt;/a&gt; and has made it so that children get to choose whether to notify their parents. iOS 15.2 also brings changes to Safari and Siri that will redirect users to resources if they search for topics related to CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpg3CG"&gt;The update also includes Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824733/apple-iphone-part-service-history-ios-15-2"&gt;new parts and service history feature&lt;/a&gt;, which can show you which parts on your device have been replaced and whether the job was done using genuine Apple parts. Apple says that the iPhone XR, XS, and SE second-gen will show if your battery was replaced and that the iPhone 11 and up will also show if your display has been replaced. The iPhone 12 and 13 models will be able to show info about camera replacements as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsjGrg"&gt;The repair history will show up in Settings &amp;gt; General  &amp;gt; About, under the name and software version section. If you haven’t replaced the battery, screen, or camera on your phone, it won’t show up, according to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212878"&gt;Apple’s support document&lt;/a&gt; for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCRjka"&gt;To download iOS 15.2, go to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update. As usual, it can take a moment to roll out to everyone, so if you don’t see it you may want to check back in after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qY1oWF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 13th, 3:04PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added info about repair history info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases Android app to help find sneaky AirTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KY4BEXF4EvnZH2A-B3nMIj0kPB0=/0x56:566x433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265952/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_11.13.48.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tracker Detect works on Android 9 and above.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hnHV3z"&gt;Apple has released an app called Tracker Detect, which the company says will let Android users search for AirTags or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;other Find My-compatible trackers&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Chipolo One Spot tracking tag (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-launches-airtags-and-find-my-detector-app-for-android-in-effort-to-boost-privacy/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the app, it looks for devices that have been separated from their owners — if it finds any, it will let you play a sound on it so you can locate it, and it will give you instructions on how to figure out who the AirTag belongs to and how to disable it if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drdQju"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516178/apple-airtags-tracking-devices-update-play-sound-privacy-android-app"&gt;announced that this app was coming in June&lt;/a&gt;, promising that it would allow Android users to find potentially malicious trackers being used without their knowledge. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;Unlike on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, though, it doesn’t seem like this app will constantly do scans in the background and alert you if something is up — it’s purely a manual search. Tracker Detect also doesn’t help you keep track of the AirTags attached to an Apple account, so it’s not helping Android users actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; AirTags.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YdF_fcB-zP5g6_1OrmVltlHAPow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085120/Screenshot_20211213_133032.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can run a manual scan with Tracker Detect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zFc8wj"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that the app “gives Android users the ability to scan for an AirTag or supported Find My enabled item trackers that might be traveling with them without their knowledge. We are raising the bar on privacy for our users and the industry, and hope others will follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhVEWl"&gt;For at least two &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers, Tracker Detect didn’t show up in a Play Store search on our devices. However, you can install it by &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect"&gt;following this link to its store page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Apple employee says she won’t withdraw her labor board complaint</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhlsXd"&gt;Former Apple employee Cher Scarlett says the company didn’t adequately live up to its half of a settlement, so she won’t withdraw her complaint to the National Labor Relations Board as agreed, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__8jy2n3rr1sb"&gt;Scarlett says that her settlement with Apple required it to post “a company-wide memo clarifying employee rights including discussing pay &amp;amp; working conditions,” “in a prominent and visible location on the People site.” She says that the company did post a notice to its site, but that it was only up during the week that Apple employees were given off for Thanksgiving. “I’d argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible,” Scarlett &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032"&gt;tweeted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyTsr3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Despite the fact that there was no requirement for a time period, the agreement clearly stated "in a prominent and visible location on the People site".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible.&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f6ksV6"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/facilitate-settlements"&gt;NLRB says&lt;/a&gt; it can reject a withdrawal request made because of a private settlement if it “violates the National Labor Relations Act or Board policy.” Scarlett told&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the board initially rejected her request, and sent a list of 22 changes that the board would need Apple to make before it would approve the withdrawal. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the requested changes removed wording that would’ve prevented Scarlett from encouraging someone “to file any charge or complaint with any administrative agency or Court against Apple” for a year. According to Scarlett, Apple refused to make those changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7x6pQ"&gt;“I technically could ask for a unilateral withdrawal at this point,” Scarlett said in a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying that she had been “interested in doing that to avoid witnesses having to give testimony, because realistically the memo is the best outcome we would have gotten from the board.” According to Scarlett, the group of potential witnesses decided it was worth it to continue with the complaint, potentially risking retaliation for testifying, given how Apple handled posting the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2pYYC"&gt;Scarlett &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22788245/cher-scarlett-apple-nlrb-settlement-leaves-company-appletoo-pay-equity"&gt;left the company in November&lt;/a&gt;, after filing the complaint that accused the company of engaging “in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity.” While at the company, she worked to let employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;discuss and gather data about pay equity&lt;/a&gt; and was part of #AppleToo, a campaign about the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;failure to deal with harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s app tracking transparency feature isn’t an instant privacy button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BRtHG6ikFWC0DwMOxhTVOAhRjuI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70259172/FB_ATT_Prompt.001.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByQJj0"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69396795-f6e1-4624-95d8-121e4e5d7839"&gt;report from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; acts as a reminder of what Apple’s App Tracking Transparency settings do and do not do to protect your privacy (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/apple-reaches-quiet-truce-over-iphone-privacy-changes/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While asking apps to not track you does keep them from collecting and selling data tied to your personal advertising identity, it doesn’t keep developers from collecting any information about you at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAawK0"&gt;The feature, introduced in iOS 14.5, is meant to prevent app-makers from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;tracking what you do and selling that information to advertisers&lt;/a&gt;. Companies like Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;cried foul when it was introduced&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it would hurt their ability to show targeted, personalized ads, and therefore hurt businesses that relied on those ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k1GJHu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9G2ObX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies have turned to aggregated and anonymized data, which still comes from individuals&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WDIM97"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, though, developers have taken Apple’s rules to mean that they’re allowed to target ads at cohorts, or groups that people are put into without needing to have unique IDs assigned. The report says that developers like Snap, Inc. have continued collecting some data, including from those who have asked them not to track them, with the justification that anything that could be tied to an individual user would be anonymized and grouped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfnW4L"&gt;It’s a similar concept to FLoC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;Google’s plan for a post-third-party cookie internet&lt;/a&gt;, where individuals are assigned labels describing what kind of things they might buy instead of being tracked individually. Ads can still be targeted, without advertisers having to keep track of everything everyone does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RCvaE"&gt;Some developers &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/10/more-details-emerge-on-how-snap-facebook-and-others-are-skirting-app-tracking-transparency/"&gt;have admitted&lt;/a&gt;, though, that they also try to make predictions about what users do after seeing ads based on info they receive from ad companies. The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;also says that some personalized data, like IP address, location, and screen size, still makes its way to advertisers, to help ensure that ads fit properly and show up in the right language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFJlqH"&gt;According to the report, Facebook and many other companies are planning on selling ads using aggregated or anonymized data. While Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;partially blamed Apple’s policies&lt;/a&gt; for it missing its earnings goals last quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;it’s estimated&lt;/a&gt; that the ads affected by the rules only made up 5 percent of its annual ad revenue. In other words, Apple’s ad tracking permissions were never going to destroy Facebook’s ad business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77cmgb"&gt;None of this is to say that there are no privacy benefits to hitting the “Ask app not to track” button — a previous &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation found that Snap, Inc, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/31/22756135/apple-app-tracking-transparency-policy-snapchat-facebook-twitter-youtube-lose-10-billion"&gt;lost $10 billion combined after the feature was implemented&lt;/a&gt;, so there was obviously a market for ads driven by that data. But it’s good to remember that even Apple, a company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;prides itself on “standing up” for its users&lt;/a&gt;, can’t stop companies from collecting your data with a single switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="z2xR9j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to&amp;amp;nbsp;use the iOS app tracking blocker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"},{"title":"Keep it Locked","url":"https://www.theverge.com/c/22796344/cybersecurity-how-to-protect-hacked-account"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Invasion feels like the first chapter of a sci-fi epic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBT6IX4NQ20qtGe-IsN-TpUjf4I=/482x0:3359x1918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258618/Invasion_Photo_011006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9n9RgM"&gt;The first season of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; on Apple TV Plus feels a little incomplete. Across its 10 episodes, which chart a handful of humans grappling with an alien invasion, the story slowly teases out the reality of what’s happening. There are hints here and there — a haunting artificial voice, a mysterious alien-killing weapon, a kid with seizures that may or may not show the future — but the biggest reveal of all doesn’t even happen until the very last shot in the final episode. It still managed to pull me in — but that pull has a lot to do with potential. Rather than standing on its own, the initial season of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; feels like the first chapter of a much grander science fiction epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83ezo3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; gets off to a slow start&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most stories about an alien invasion, which tend to focus on the alien part, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; lingers on human trauma. Early on, there’s barely even a mention of the invading extraterrestrials. Instead,&lt;em&gt; Invasion&lt;/em&gt;’s global story tracks a handful of different threads spread across the world, which ultimately end up loosely connected. Each has some tie to the otherworldly events: there’s a young boy in London who is prone to seizures that may be connected to the invasion; a family from Long Island that’s struggling with infidelity and also happens to possibly have a weapon that can kill the aliens; a space engineer in Japan who seems to be the only one able to communicate with them; and an American soldier who is separated from his squad in Afghanistan after what appears to be an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDs0Zv"&gt;The show does a great job of making you care about these characters, mostly because you spend so much time with them. You understand why the engineer is working tirelessly to find a stranded astronaut after lots of long, heartfelt scenes revealing their secret relationship. Likewise, while the soldier comes across as a jerk initially, his slowly revealed backstory ultimately turns him into a sympathetic figure. There’s lots of great character development going on, but it also requires patience since it takes quite a while to get to the actual aliens. For the first half of the season, it’s mostly just hints that there’s something going on beyond a natural disaster of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTc2-wBP-YFwG77benxDHPBkg08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079599/Invasion_Photo_011001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pzxnjQ"&gt;This all means that when the aliens do finally appear, it’s a huge deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776188/invasion-apple-tv-plus-episode-6-aliens"&gt;The reveal is great&lt;/a&gt; and neatly changes the tone of the show. From then on, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; becomes something different, balancing out its character drama (which never fully goes away, thankfully) with some intriguing alien mysteries and the flat-out horror of dealing with the invaders. There’s a terrifying scene in a secluded house, where a family tries to sneak away from one of the spiked blob creatures; later, we see the soldier making his way through a war-torn hospital amidst an infestation as if this was a first-person &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vgcp5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You never get much in the way of answers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AXaQXi"&gt;What you don’t get are much in the way of answers. There are some small revelations, like when you learn that the London teen had visions of the invasion before it happened or when it appears that the Japanese researcher discovers how the aliens communicate. But nothing is ever clear. Even when it seems like the aliens have been defeated, the show throws another twist at you. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Mystery is important, and those unknowns are part of what has kept me coming back. But the result is that season 1 doesn’t feel like a complete story, with its own distinct arc. It’s 10 episodes of setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ9WrR"&gt;The good news is that Apple revealed earlier this week that &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is coming back for a second season, with co-creator Simon Kinberg saying they would be “expanding our universe in the most intimate and epic ways.” And after a full season of setting things up, I’m anxious to see where it’s finally going.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s concessions in China reportedly include a secret $275 billion deal and one odd change in Maps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="China Development Forum (CDF) 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-g6pMQeaQtsPNtqxMwj3xHnbY0=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70257237/937560290.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook attends China Development Forum (CDF) 2018&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Visual China Group via Getty Images/Visual China Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uuy4e9"&gt;Tim Cook has pushed Apple’s value within close range of $3 trillion, and a lot of that has to do with the former operations lead’s ability to manage a relationship with China, where many of its products are made and, increasingly, many of them are sold. A report this week from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; relies on unnamed sources and internal documents to peel back some of the details about Apple’s ties with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tTir7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 1,250-word MOU between Apple and China’s National Development and Reform Commission reportedly runs for five years and accounted for $275 billion in spending&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1kBY4"&gt;That includes a request Apple reportedly received in 2014 or 2015 about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senkaku_Islands"&gt;a small group of uninhabited islands&lt;/a&gt; that China and Japan apparently have a dispute over in terms of who owns them. Going by either the Senkaku Islands or the Diaoyu Islands, depending on which side of the argument you’re taking, they inspired a request from China to members of the Maps team to make them appear larger, even when viewers are zoomed out on the map. According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, not only did Apple eventually make the change, but even today, for viewers using its map from within China, the islands are still shown at a larger scale than the territories around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Satellite views of the Senkaku Islands" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYck_ik3Kilhuzno12VIIj354wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080195/588404986.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A satellite image of the Senkaku Islands located in the East of China on April 01, 2016 in Japan. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cVgQYI"&gt;The report also details disputes over everything from iTunes and iCloud to Apple Pay. The figure that looms over everything is a 1,250-word memorandum of understanding that &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says Tim Cook signed during a publicized trip to China in 2016. The way it’s laid out, Cook went to China because of repeated regulatory actions affecting Apple’s business. By signing a five-year agreement (with an option to extend to a sixth year) promising investments, business deals, and training in China, worth an estimated $275 billion, the aim was to avoid further disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj5SPP"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; has confirmed from its sources, that seems to have mostly held true. The report points out &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-becomes-largest-smartphone-brand-china-october-2021/"&gt;data from the analysts at Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; who said that in October, Apple became the largest smartphone brand in China, a title it hadn’t held in six years. Meanwhile, Apple has built new R&amp;amp;D centers in the country and started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;storing iCloud data for Chinese users there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWxick"&gt;However, that relationship also has downsides, with critics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18020508/how-china-complicates-apples-chest-thumping-about-privacy"&gt;questioning the company’s commitment to privacy&lt;/a&gt; — its Private Relay feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523871/china-private-relay-regulatory-reasons-not-launching-great-firewall-internet-censorship"&gt;will not be available in China&lt;/a&gt; — and business dealings with companies accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;links to Uyghur forced labor&lt;/a&gt;. That’s before we mention the other visible concessions that harken back to that decision about the disputed islands, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632029/apple-engraving-filter-censorship-keyword-china-hong-kong-taiwan"&gt;the numbers Apple won’t let you engrave on an iPad in China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728257/apple-quran-majeed-app-removed-china"&gt;takedowns of certain apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFqi7c"&gt;After the report surfaced, the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3159087/apples-reported-us275-billion-china-investment-questioned-state-media"&gt;&lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports (via &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/12/09/chinese-media-downplaying-apples-reported-275b-deal-with-the-country"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that a state-run tabloid in China referred to it as “McCarthyism,” claiming it was an attack “clearly driven by the ‘political correctness’ of Sinophobia.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="cB1Lly"&gt;In 2017 — long before Apple declared that cloud gaming could only exist on the iPhone if it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;jumped through gigantic hoops&lt;/a&gt; — Sony was preparing to launch its PlayStation Now cloud gaming service on mobile phones, a confidential document reveals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocH39i"&gt;It could have been the single biggest expansion of Sony’s PS Now game service in years. Originally, the service streamed PS2 and PS3 games to smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and the PS3 and PS Vita, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14626676/playstation-now-discontinued-ps3-vita-smart-tvs"&gt;cut off all those original platforms in late 2017&lt;/a&gt; (coincidence?) to focus on the PlayStation 4 and Windows PC instead. While it recently added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397555/playstation-now-1080p-streaming-support-resolution"&gt;1080p streaming&lt;/a&gt; and a PS5 client, it’s never been offered on Android, iOS, or Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwJK83"&gt;But according to a confidential document unearthed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from the&lt;em&gt; Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple had insider knowledge of Sony’s upcoming launch. Apple had heard about a “[not-yet-announced] mobile extension of an existing streaming service for PlayStation users, streaming access to over 450+ PS3 games to start, with PS4 games to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNqD5z"&gt;A handful of PS4 games launched on PlayStation Now in July 2017, but the presentation notes that the service is “only PS3 games right now,” suggesting Apple got tipped off about more than just the move to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;PlayStation Now is listed as a “mobile” subscription&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;in a document labeled “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL — ATTORNEY’S EYES ONLY”.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iINjJs"&gt;Why did Apple bring this up? It’s smack dab in the middle of an explanation of Apple’s plans to launch its own game subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, which wouldn’t be announced until two years later. At the time, Apple was preparing to target 30 top game studios and ask for as many as “a few hundred titles” to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Eqhn65"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;I wrote that Sony squandered the opportunity to be a leader in cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;, despite being the first major company to recognize its potential, buying &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of the early startups (Gaikai and OnLive) that proved out the idea. But despite Apple’s resistance to cloud gaming on the App Store — read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826297/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-streaming-exclusives-iphone-ipad-gamepas"&gt;my new story about what happened with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; — there’s an intriguing possibility that Sony isn’t giving up yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816087/sony-playstation-5-game-subscription-service-xbox-games-pass-now-spartacus"&gt;Sony reportedly now has a Project Spartacus&lt;/a&gt; that would bundle its cloud gaming service with a PlayStation Plus subscription, and it would bring original PS1 games and “eventually” PS5 games to the service too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRSIgj"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Jason Schreier’s scoop for &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t mention mobile phones at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmK2x1"&gt;While it’s possible Sony read the room and decided it wasn’t worth fighting Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17392470/apple-rejects-valve-steam-link-app-store-ios-game-steaming"&gt;the way Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft, and Google did for mobile access, it might also be that Sony decided to focus on selling more consoles instead — if you do have a PS4 or PS5 in your house, the company’s PS Remote Play app already lets you stream it (perhaps even &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2021/09/14/ps4-remote-play-ps5-games-over-mobile-data-update-download-broadcast-ios-android-iphone/"&gt;over cellular&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429291/sony-ps5-remote-play-dualsense-apple-mac-iphone-ipod-ipad-apple-tv"&gt;to a wide array of Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Android. You can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;stream a new PS5 to your old PS4&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a new lease on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5t8Yy"&gt;Sony wouldn’t comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
