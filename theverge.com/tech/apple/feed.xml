    <title>It’s game over for Arizona’s controversial App Store bill</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The legislation disappeared before a scheduled vote last week, and now it’s likely done for the year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bkMQgy"&gt;Arizona House Bill 2005, a hotly contested piece of legislation that would have imposed developer-friendly changes to Apple and Google’s mobile app stores, is now on death’s door. The &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt;, which would have allowed alternative payment systems on Android and iOS that bypass the stores’ 30 percent cuts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349302/arizona-hb2005-bill-vote-skipped-senate-apple-google-ios-android-app-store"&gt;mysteriously disappeared last week&lt;/a&gt; prior to a scheduled vote that could have sent it straight to the governor’s desk to be signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBIRDW"&gt;The bill had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;just won a landmark victory in the Arizona House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, and the state Senate was officially set to begin its vote at 3PM local time. HB2005 was the first bill on the agenda, yet it never came up. Now, it turns out that the Senate decided to pull the bill at the last minute, and its sponsor tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that its fate is effectively sealed for the rest of the year. Arizona will wrap up its congressional session next month with no plans to hear HB2005 again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73lQ9d"&gt;That’s bad news for the bill’s proponents, which include a coalition of app makers and prominent Apple critics that have been outspoken in recent months on the need for regulations on mobile app distribution. The fight is being led by the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), an industry group consisting of Apple critics and competitors like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games and Spotify, that has taken the fight against alleged app store monopolies to the local stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOVBtO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These bills are part of a far-reaching push to enact state-level app store regulations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCBpiZ"&gt;The CAF has begun lobbying state legislatures to introduce bills in more than a half-dozen states at this point, to varying degrees of success. HB2005 was its most promising campaign yet, after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failure in North Dakota last month&lt;/a&gt; sank one of the first legitimate app store bills to go to vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHBsWI"&gt;The primary goal of these bills is to allow developers to bypass Apple and Google’s 30 percent app store commission, while much loftier aims include forcing Apple to allow entire alternative app marketplaces on iOS and making it illegal for tech companies to retaliate against developers for trying to bypass the app store policies. Apple has decried such bills by saying they threaten to “destroy the iPhone as you know it” by opening it up to security risks and undermining the revenue stream it says helps enforce App Store reviews and other benefits, though the company has only ever spoken publicly about such legislation through submitted testimony. Without Arizona, the movement is that much weaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3I4ZjZ"&gt;So who killed HB2005? We don’t really know, but a clearer picture is beginning to emerge. At the very least, congressional members have now been willing to say publicly that Big Tech lobbying had a noticeable effect on the bill just before it went up for a vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9CrNP"&gt;State Rep. Regina Cobb, the bill’s sponsor and a Republican representing the state’s fifth district, claims Apple and Google “hired almost every lobbyist in town” and named six specific lobbyists who, she says, caused Senate members who’d previously agreed to vote to waver. “We thought we had the votes before we went to the committee yesterday, and then we heard that the votes weren’t there and they weren’t going to take the time to put it up,” Cobb said of the Senate Commerce Committee’s decision to pull the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5nTLK"&gt;That lines up with what Commerce Committee Chair J.D. Mesnard, a Republican who represents Arizona’s District 17, &lt;a href="https://prospect.org/power/big-tech-lobbyists-take-down-arizonas-app-store-bill/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect &lt;/em&gt;on Friday of last week&lt;/a&gt;: he pulled the bill because he felt it would fail. “I polled the committee members and there just wasn’t enough support for it,” Mesnard said in an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt;. “A number of members were conflicted on it, others were just opposed. There was some support for it, but it definitely was coming up short.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14vlSr"&gt;Cobb says she doesn’t think anything illegal or nefarious occurred, just lobbying as usual — unlike outspoken Apple critic and Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who publicly accused powerful corporations of making illicit deals, colluding with the chamber’s Democrats (some of whom opposed the bill) and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HFavHv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google “hired almost every lobbyist in town”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1GDH0"&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show,” Hansson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1374842497000673289"&gt;wrote on Twitter on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; of last week. “The bill was killed in mid-air while on the agenda with a backroom deal. Apple has hired the governor’s former chief of staff, and word is that he brokered a deal to prevent this from even being heard.” Although &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has heard a similar allegation from multiple sources with knowledge of the situation, no one, save Hansson, felt comfortable offering an explanation on the record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57ujSy"&gt;The seeming death of HB2005 and the confusion and mystery surrounding it underscore both the immense power of tech titans like Apple and Google and also the rough legislative road ahead for similar bills in Illinois, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and other states around the country. The clear takeaway is that although these bills are the result of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;successful lobbying efforts&lt;/a&gt; from the CAF and its partners, the Silicon Valley lobbying that has arisen to counter these bills has proven just as savvy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5swZGE"&gt;“There’s a legitimate issue here. It’s undeniable [Apple and Google] have gatekeeper power and hold sway over the app stores, and there’s just nowhere else to go. You have to go through one of these companies to get your app before consumers,” says Pat Garofalo, the director of state and local policy at the nonprofit American Economic Liberties Project, which has voiced support for the bills. “It makes perfect sense there are lots of forces — whether they be small, medium, or large — arrayed on both sides of this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrxQZJ"&gt;Cobb admits she took up the cause after being approached by the CAF and that having other big tech companies as the opposition didn’t help because it added extreme pressure to the impending vote and caused a number of congressional members on both sides to express doubt and confusion about the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5fdApK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I realized once you start taking on Apple and Google this way you’re going to be hit pretty hard.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YbD0G"&gt;“I realized once you start taking on Apple and Google this way you’re going to be hit pretty hard,” Cobb said. She said she had multiple meetings with Apple, including with longtime Apple veteran Tim Powderly, the director of federal government affairs at the company. She says the conversations were cordial, but that Apple was very intent on finding a compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZWKnn"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. Google did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PrEzO1"&gt;Regardless of why the bill was pulled, the outcome is the same: Arizona HB2005 won’t be changing how Apple and Google operate their mobile app stores because its chances of ever becoming law are slim to none. “Unless it is brought as a striker, it will need to be re introduced next year,” Cobb told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a follow-up email on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MaB8H"&gt;A striker, formally known as a “strike everything amendment,” is a controversial legislative maneuver that aims to replace the entire text of a bill in an attempt to reopen debate on it and push it forward without having to abide by standard deadlines. Cobb said such a move is unlikely at this point because strikers “often get negative publicity and they’re not always successful,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaT9br"&gt;While Cobb says she isn’t intimidated by Apple or Google, she also tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; she’s not likely to keep pushing unless she thinks she’ll succeed. “I’m trying to decide how much political capital I want to put into this.” Failing that, Arizona’s Congress will meet again the following January — but the state’s attempt at regulating Apple and Google’s app stores is effectively over for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HtKclx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This idea is out there, now this is sort of in the zeitgeist.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yggVg0"&gt;The CAF says it will continue the fight, even though it’s now seen two legislative defeats in its app store lobbying efforts, the first a more aggressive bill that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failed to garner enough votes in the North Dakota House last month&lt;/a&gt;. “The legislative session is not over. We will continue to push for solutions that will increase choice, support app developers and small businesses and put a stop to monopolistic practices,” said Meghan DiMuzio, the CAF’s executive director, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBxbTg"&gt;Garofalo of the American Economic Liberties Project thinks it’s likely one of these state bills will succeed at one point, especially in the absence of meaningful federal regulation or antitrust enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VLYVc3"&gt;“This idea is out there, now this is sort of in the zeitgeist,” he said. “I do think a state will do this, and there are really good reasons for a state to do it.” All it will take, he adds, is a group of lawmakers that “hears the right arguments, gets the upside, and decides to do it.” At that point, the primary thing standing in the way will be the lobbying efforts of tech companies that stand to benefit when these bills fail. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple supplier Foxconn warns that component shortages will last until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A woman wearing a face mask seen working on her computer on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3iY0SHa8z7gXjmOsROawNkE0A9M=/0x0:3250x2167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051722/1230428833.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WM8czH"&gt;The ongoing global shortage for electronic components continues, and Foxconn — which handles manufacturing for Apple, among other major tech heavyweights — has announced that it’s starting to see the impact of shortages. According to Young Liu, Foxconn’s CEO, the company won’t be able to fulfill some of its orders due to those shortages, which he expects will last until &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; the second quarter of next year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-supplier-Foxconn-says-chip-shortage-will-curb-shipments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8UU8a"&gt;“The [supply in the] first two months of this quarter was still ok, as our clients are all very big, but we started to see changes happening this month,” Liu reportedly told investors during the company’s latest earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbl2tS"&gt;The impact of the shortages isn’t expected to be large, at least for now: Liu expects that the company will only miss around 10 percent of its orders due to part shortages, citing the large order volumes of its customers. But it’s still a notable miss for Foxconn — and by extension, its customers like Apple — who may be forced to contend with delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Zz4z8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;10 percent &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NA0e8c"&gt;Foxconn also saw slowdowns in manufacturing last spring at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, following mandatory government shutdowns and quarantined factory workers. Those delays trickled down across the supply chain, leading to a later-than-usual November launch for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238081/apple-iphone-12-mass-production-delay-rumors-coronavirus-impact#:~:text=Apple%20is%20reportedly%20delaying%20mass,iPhone%2012%20mass%20production%20plans."&gt;Apple’s iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. The current slowdown, by comparison, seems less drastic, but if parts continue to be hard to get, delays could mount later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg2Ybt"&gt;Foxconn is the latest company to call out the ongoing chip and component shortage that has slowing down production of everything from next-generation consoles to cars. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;Samsung warned its investors&lt;/a&gt; of a “serious imbalance” in the semiconductor industry as it prepares to deal with the ongoing global chip shortage. Car companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-china-production/chip-shortages-could-slow-automotive-production-vw-and-suppliers-say-idUSKBN28E1IN"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2021/02/03/nissan-truck-production-reduced-canton-plant-due-chip-shortage/4369759001/"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/toyota-says-chip-shortage-impacting-output-of-texas-made-trucks"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; have have had to slow truck and car production due to a surfeit of silicon. Both Sony and Microsoft have both cited part shortages as major factors in the near-impossible-to-buy status of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. And the aftermarket value of PC graphics cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;has doubled, even tripled&lt;/a&gt;, due to a combination of unprecedented shortages and demand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple blocked some searches with the word ‘Asian,’ and now it’s getting fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KBYeeJdZ2lPDnpkTG1CjBtdT3Bg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69050574/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4DWj4R"&gt;Apple’s built-in web content filter for iOS and macOS has apparently been blocking any searches containing the word “Asian” for almost a year, and the error is finally getting fixed, according to a &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-asian-adult-content-filter-ios-fix/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The issue shows up when you’re using a device that has the “Limit Adult Websites” content restriction turned on. But it’s not just blocking adult websites; it’s blocking almost any searches relating to Asian culture, including “Asian market,” “Asian culture,” and even “stop Asian hate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4HQNl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to confirm that the above searches were blocked on devices running current versions of Apple’s software (iPadOS 14.4.1 and macOS 11.2.3) with the content restrictions turned on. The searches are blocked on both Safari and Chrome on iOS devices, but Chrome was able to perform them on macOS. Devices without the content restrictions turned on can perform the searches and receive results. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnBi-paaXCSm7De5vPXKvZYOqZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408688/IMG_A6361A17FF98_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The error message shown when a search is blocked by the content restrictions on an iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NzBuf2"&gt;The good news is that the issue should soon be resolved. The searches work on devices running the iOS 14.5 beta, &lt;em&gt;Mashable &lt;/em&gt;reports. Still, it’s ridiculous that it took this long to fix: there are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charliestigler/status/1229845987864109056"&gt;reports of the issue&lt;/a&gt; from February 2020, and it shouldn’t have been an issue in the first place. Of course, creating a filter for adult content is extremely difficult, but almost entirely blocking a word used to describe &lt;a href="https://asiapacific.unfpa.org/en/node/15207"&gt;60 percent of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt; is obviously incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35eD3x"&gt;In current, non-beta software, the filter behaves very strangely. “Asian restaurants” is blocked on macOS but not iOS, while “Asian food” is blocked on both. And while the issue has been around for a while, it’s especially embarrassing for Apple in the current moment, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358649/anti-asian-hate-violence-linkedin-content-moderation-atlanta-shooting"&gt;anti-Asian sentiment and violence have been on the rise&lt;/a&gt;. It’s good to see it should be solved in the next versions of iOS, but it shouldn’t have taken this long. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Maps will show COVID-19 travel guidances so you know what to expect at the airport</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jN7xWca94kPHgeE-CGw2DJzdJLY=/674x456:3141x2101/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69050299/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_11.43.52_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H0w5VY"&gt;To help make travel during the pandemic a little less stressful, Apple Maps &lt;a href="https://aci.aero/news/2021/03/30/covid-19-airport-travel-guidance-now-available-in-apple-maps/"&gt;will now display travel guidance information&lt;/a&gt; provided by the Airports Council International (ACI) so you know what to expect before you take off or land at your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OqhAK"&gt;The travel guidances — like mask requirements, health screenings, and quarantine guidelines — will be displayed on an individual airport’s place card in Apple Maps, with links to official airport guidance websites as well. The information should be viewable on iPhones, iPads, and Macs — though, currently, only airports that are participating in the &lt;a href="https://api.acris.aero/homepage/"&gt;ACI’s Health Measures Portal&lt;/a&gt; will feature the new information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YiXo9aC8ZxOxJjvEVW_yrtdONeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408615/applemaps_travelguidance.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MacStories&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travel guidances in Apple Maps on iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uviDZn"&gt;Apple Maps has been updated to display other useful COVID-19 information over the last year, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240546/apple-maps-covid-19-testing-sites-mobility-trends"&gt;the location of testing sites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334609/apple-maps-facebook-google-covid-19-vaccine-locations"&gt;available vaccine providers&lt;/a&gt;. You can check Apple Maps to see if the airport you’re traveling to has guidance, or use the &lt;a href="https://api.acris.aero/check_and_fly/COVID19/v1/"&gt;ACI’s Check &amp;amp; Fly&lt;/a&gt; tool to find participating airports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe’s new $14.99 iPad subscription bundles Photoshop, Illustrator, Fresco, and more</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0t3urR"&gt;Adobe has launched a new bundle for iPad creators. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fmobile-design-bundle.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22358304%2Fadobe-design-mobile-bundle-price-ipad-photoshop-illustrator-fresco" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Design Mobile Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is available for $14.99 a month or $149.99 a year, and it includes access to iOS Creative Cloud apps like Photoshop, Illustrator, Fresco, and Spark, as well as services like Adobe Fonts and 100GB of cloud storage. Unlike Adobe’s other bundles, this won’t get you access to its desktop apps. Adobe says the bundle saves you 50 percent compared to paying for each app separately and that “they all work with touch and Apple Pencil.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnMg16"&gt;Adobe’s mobile apps have come on a lot in the last couple of years. Photoshop only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20937111/adobe-photoshop-ipad-now-available-download-cloud-psd-workflow"&gt;arrived on the iPad&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019, lacking many of the features of its desktop counterpart. But over time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21336315/photoshop-ipad-refine-edge-brush-rotate-canvas-update"&gt;Adobe has continued to add features&lt;/a&gt;, including a new rotate canvas tool that arrived on Photoshop as well as Illustrator. The feature has been popular enough that the company is &lt;a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/03/30/everythings-coming-together-for-mobile-creativity.html#new-ways-to-create:~:text=Our%20work%20on%20mobile%20applications%20is,capability%20to%20Illustrator%20on%20the%20desktop."&gt;bringing it to desktop Illustrator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V47tWP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Soon, you’ll be able to load your brushes onto Photoshop on the iPad”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bvjiXE"&gt;Adobe also says that support for Photoshop’s desktop brushes is coming soon to iPad. “Soon, you’ll be able to load your brushes onto Photoshop on the iPad, meaning that all the great brushes you’ve discovered or created on Photoshop on the desktop will be close at hand on the iPad as well,” the company writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zw0SHn"&gt;A monthly cost of $14.99 makes this one of the less expensive bundles Adobe offers, though you are limited to only accessing it via an iPad (and iPhone in the case of Fresco). Currently, you can subscribe to all of its apps for $52.99 a month. Meanwhile, if you only need Photoshop and Lightroom, there’s a bundle with 20GB of storage for $9.99 a month that works on both desktop and tablet. (A bundle with 1TB of storage costs $19.99 a month.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iWRwN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 30th, 1:37PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article originally stated that Adobe’s rotate canvas tool will be coming to Photoshop on desktop. This is incorrect — Photoshop already has a similar tool. It’s actually coming to Illustrator on desktop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021 announced as online-only event </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U4iHHOJmM_ffEj6TupX83HJTEmo=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047863/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9obnno"&gt;Apple just announced that its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) will take place on June 7th through June 11th this year, and that like last year it will be an online-only event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDK3Ak"&gt;The announcement, as is typical for Apple, is opaque when it comes to details, but there might be a tantalizing hint: is the memoji character’s glasses simply showing a reflection from their laptop? Or could Apple finally be gearing up to announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;long-rumored VR headset&lt;/a&gt; or AR glasses?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPkLeT"&gt;“We are working to make WWDC21 our biggest and best yet, and are excited to offer Apple developers new tools to support them as they create apps that change the way we live, work, and play,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of worldwide developer relations, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PHK6V"&gt;WWDC is when Apple typically details changes coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS with the occasional hardware surprise. Last year, it also dedicated a significant portion of its keynote to announcing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;Mac lineup’s transition to its own Apple Silicon&lt;/a&gt; processors. With this transition still underway, it seems likely that Apple will have an update to share about its progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pz8B8y"&gt;New hardware tends to be less of a focus at the developer conference, but it’s not unheard of. Apple used WWDC 2019 as its venue to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646424/apple-mac-pro-redesign-new-specs-features-photos-wwdc-2019"&gt;announce the new Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and at WWDC 2017 it announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732144/apple-homepod-speaker-announced-siri-price-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;HomePod smart speaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/5/15740298/new-apple-imacs-announced-price-specs-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;updated iMac desktops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732350/new-apple-ipad-announced-price-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxhVo"&gt;It’s not surprising that Apple has opted to make its global conference for developers online-only given that the impact of COVID-19 is still being felt around the world. Facebook’s F8 developer conference &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346432/facebook-f8-conference-2021-date-virtual-event-sign-up"&gt;will be virtual this year&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307929/sdcc-e3-anime-expo-cancel-in-person-virtual-events"&gt;San Diego Comic-Con and the 2021 Anime Expo&lt;/a&gt; have also confirmed that their physical events will not take place. But some organizations are attempting to make limited physical events happen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;like Mobile World Congress in Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s independent repair program is expanding to ‘nearly every country where Apple products are sold’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iphone 5 teardown (ifixit)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xCYE7QtWwTDVz4Xn3zzDP694JJk=/29x0:772x495/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69045781/El6QfQ4IFThwHHqH.1419974202.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iphone 5 teardown (ifixit)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z9iaWg"&gt;Getting an Apple product repaired often involves going directly to the (expensive) source — an Apple Store — or a big third-party firm. If you live somewhere with limited choices, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapples-independent-repair-provider-program-expands-globally%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22357187%2Fapple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced expansion&lt;/a&gt; of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20838307/apple-iphone-repairs-parts-independent-shops"&gt;Independent Repair Provider&lt;/a&gt; program might change that. The company plans to expand its repair program to “nearly every country where Apple products are sold,” meaning someone near you could soon be using official Apple parts to fix your cracked phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Z3IiU"&gt;Right now, the program is only available in the US, Canada and Europe, but according to Apple’s announcement, repair providers from countries including Australia, Japan, and Korea will be able to join this week, with providers from even more countries including China joining the program later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="352Pf4"&gt;Providers have to apply to participate, but once approved, they can only buy a limited variety of first-party materials like batteries, screens, and diagnostic tools. So while your local repair person will be able to fix the most common issues with official parts, anything more more exotic will have to go through Apple, one of its authorized service providers, or risk voiding a warranty or becoming unsupported down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HL8BsO"&gt;If you actually do the hard work of repairing devices, there’s other things to be aware of, too. Joining the program comes with a contract that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;reportedly gives Apple&lt;/a&gt; the right to both inspect repair shops and fine them if it finds something amiss. Apple can charge $1,000 per transaction for any shop it catches using knockoff parts in more than two percent of repairs, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdjnv/apples-independent-repair-program-is-invasive-to-shops-and-their-customers-contract-shows"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdgFqM"&gt;Apple generally only seems to be supportive of third-party repairs if it can find a way to make money off of them, and this repair program doesn’t seem to be any different. This is the company that routinely attempts to kill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia"&gt;right-to-repair bills&lt;/a&gt; and has devised methods to make iPhones non-functional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776965/iphone-xs-max-xr-battery-service-third-party-repair"&gt;if they use third-party batteries&lt;/a&gt;, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkBzsR"&gt;You can read the full list of participating countries and regions &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapples-independent-repair-provider-program-expands-globally%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22357187%2Fapple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB of storage for $299 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, but only in space gray. Or you can buy it for as low as $320 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (space gray only). If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $395&lt;/a&gt; in select colors, which is $29 off its usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$529 in space gray&lt;/a&gt;, or just $1 more, you can get this model in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="XeRDay"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration on sale for $849&lt;/a&gt;.

Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08634Y7QW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,249 in space gray;&lt;/a&gt; that’s $50 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $165 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $34 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has knocked $30 off this model’s retail price as well, bringing it down to $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is $289 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower.
