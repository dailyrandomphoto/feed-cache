    <title>Apple’s notch ‘fix’ brings fat bezels back to the MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiu7VIMuMSoYQiWrrLF65mrNB_E=/0x0:2672x1781/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70055755/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_1.13.50_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter user @Jatodaro demonstrates how to use the new ‘Scale to fit below built-in camera’ feature.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Jatodaro/status/1453382287328874497" target="_blank"&gt;@Jatodaro&lt;/a&gt; via Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sQKkP1"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212842"&gt;support document&lt;/a&gt; released yesterday details a “&lt;em&gt;Scale to fit below built-in camera”&lt;/em&gt; option in macOS that will forcibly scale apps to only use the display below the notch. It’s a temporary workaround for apps that don’t currently play nice with the notch on Apple’s new MacBook Pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FC8ZmZ"&gt;The camera notch cutout on Apple’s latest laptops was meant to enable a more expansive edge-to-edge screen. But as we saw yesterday, owners of the new MacBook Pro models have seen both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"&gt;apps and the OS misbehave&lt;/a&gt;, whereby app menus and status bar items can get hidden under the camera cutout. The scale-to-fit workaround fixes this, but results in the type of large bezels the notch was meant to negate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98Uor4"&gt;The scaling feature was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jatodaro/status/1453382287328874497"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; by artist @Jatodaro on Twitter, showing how checking the box for &lt;em&gt;‘Scale to fit below built-in camera’&lt;/em&gt; in an app’s &lt;em&gt;Get Info&lt;/em&gt; window will shrink the display for all apps. The full-sized display (with notch) will only return if either the app is closed or if the box is unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuSL5X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good news for notch haters! If you've got an app (or apps) with menus that collide with the notch, just Get Info on the app, and enable "Scale to fit below built-in camera". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the app is running (even in the bg), your display is scaled.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/M1Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#M1Pro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/M1Max?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#M1Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MacBookPro2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MacBookPro2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nlGqkFkXAH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nlGqkFkXAH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Joseph from Sketch (@Jatodaro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jatodaro/status/1453382287328874497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Qhs5"&gt;Apple also mentions in the support document that this scaling feature will disappear once developers update their apps to deal with the notch correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use SharePlay to share your FaceTime screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVae-cS6Azvyc1ojvyhJoeTGAOg=/151x0:1708x1038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70054096/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_3.39.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1rVwYI"&gt;One of the new features that iOS 15 has promised to offer is the ability to share your iPhone and iPad screen during FaceTime sessions so that you can enjoy films, music, and other media along with friends and family. While this new feature, called SharePlay, did not ship with the first version of iOS 15, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;it has been included in iOS 15.1&lt;/a&gt; and can now be enjoyed — to a limited extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoTigL"&gt;Currently, you can share content from Apple TV and Apple Music — assuming both of you are subscribers — and a few other apps. I had no problem sharing a YouTube video, for example; other apps that are supported include HBO Max, Hulu, and Disney Plus (but not Netflix). It can be presumed that the list of shareable apps will continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B82Gs8"&gt;It’s quite easy to use the new SharePlay feature, once you’ve installed iOS 15.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6YTBHh"&gt;Start a FaceTime session. Make sure whoever else is on the session also has iOS 15.1 installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gnLi6x"&gt;You should see a new icon on the upper right side of the screen that resembles a small figure in front of a screen. Tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ApbjOw"&gt;You’ll see a drop-down button that says “Share My Screen.” Tap on that and you’ll be sharing your screen with your friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on “Share My Screen” to start using SharePlay." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uVCThijIWn6KU7YrpNwga9zSr58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960467/IMG_DD5C33FA0874_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on “Share My Screen” to start using SharePlay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SharePlay lets you both watch the same YouTube video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Njh9Kxf8AiYyMVmvf0mlfAzZptA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960468/IMG_60BC16B3DB0E_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay lets you both watch the same YouTube video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gOH64r"&gt;Now you can show off your homescreen to your FaceTime friend, play a YouTube video, or listen to the same Apple Music track. If you want to switch to the other person’s screen, all they have to do is tap on their SharePlay icon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkI9Sr"&gt;Another way to share an app is to simply go to that app during a FaceTime session and start it up. If SharePlay is possible, you will get a pop-up menu asking if you want to use SharePlay, or if you want to play the video or music only for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ox15m"&gt;And at any time, you can go back to your FaceTime app, tap on the SharePlay icon, and select End SharePlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can see your friend’s home screen in miniature, or tap on it to maximize it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIJXzKVleBy8TbXilrjRe4y9D28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960470/IMG_B56CC427212E_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see your friend’s homescreen in miniature, or tap on it to maximize it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Unfortunately, some apps are not yet supported." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YmKZe1FqMkh6pCpIlWooRMI5wDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960475/IMG_B3896698408C_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, some apps are not yet supported.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHryBS"&gt;The new SharePlay feature in iOS 15.1 is probably going to be very popular. It will allow friends and family to chat together while watching videos or listening to music; let business associates discuss a spreadsheet while out and about; or make it easier to share and comment on your latest group photos. And as Apple adds more apps that can make use of SharePlay, it should just get better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s system to tell on creepy apps just arrived in beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTD-U2p-SrpiBi62HoKVK65tcPk=/223x0:2416x1462/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70054031/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.46.16.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1L2lT"&gt;Apple’s App Privacy Report, announced at WWDC 2021, has &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=n5jlz7ox&amp;amp;1635379062"&gt;made its way onto iPhones&lt;/a&gt; with the first release of the iOS 15.2 beta, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/everything-new-ios-15-2/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The new screen in Settings gives users an overview of what information their apps have access to and what they’re sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HY1At2"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0TD96VTf0Xs?t=3053"&gt;Apple’s WWDC announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the feature will show you what permissions apps have and how often they accessed them over the past week (for example, it could show that your weather app accesses your location every hour). The report will also show you which other web domains the app contacted and let you compare that with the sites you visited directly in the app to give you a better idea of who could be seeing your data. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajuZM4lbuJsxSChLwSIK-RBGslA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960619/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.32.28.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Safari Privacy Report, which shows similar data but for the websites you visit instead of the apps you use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NXYzhT"&gt;Some of Apple’s other privacy initiatives haven’t sat well with all developers. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296309/google-gmail-ios-app-privacy-labels"&gt;took Google almost two months&lt;/a&gt; to adopt iOS App Store privacy labels, and both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738940/snap-q3-2021-earnings-ios-ad-tracking"&gt;Snap&lt;/a&gt; partially blamed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;iPhone’s Ad Tracking Transparency feature&lt;/a&gt; (which lets users easily opt out of certain forms of ad tracking) for missed revenue goals. It’s possible that we’ll see more complaints from developers if the App Privacy Report paints them in a negative light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYgl6K"&gt;As always with betas, it’s not a sure-fire thing that this feature will make it into the final 15.2 release. However, Apple’s SharePlay feature, which showed up in the 15.1 beta (after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;taken out from an earlier beta&lt;/a&gt; release), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;did end up shipping with the final version&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s a good chance we could see the privacy report soon. Whether we like what shows may be another story entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5JoGh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS8GMH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese students sue Apple for not including a charger with the iPhone 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OHfvlwkzpoAbgcEOjTGzpSEO4Pk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052302/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="poI4Sh"&gt;Five Chinese students are suing Apple for not providing a charger with the iPhone 12, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vqmb/apple-sued-china-iphone-chargers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;stopped including EarPods and wall chargers with iPhones&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, opting only to include a USB-C to Lightning cable in its packaging. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/"&gt;According to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, ditching the charger and EarPods is supposed to reduce carbon emissions and preserve raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qf2nzM"&gt;There’s some skepticism as to whether Apple really did this to cut costs, rather than save the environment, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;the transition to 5G could make iPhones more expensive to make&lt;/a&gt;. Skipping out on chargers and EarPods could be a way for Apple to save a buck, and forcing customers to purchase accessories separately may help increase profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXtIhD"&gt;The students’ argument in court, which is a part of the Xiaocheng Cup Public Welfare Litigation Competition, cruxes on this premise. A report by the &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/z4w89z7vhGdeTY2algqlYw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shanghai Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes the case in detail, noting that one of the students, named Xiaofang, was frustrated that her purchase of the iPhone 12 Pro Max didn’t come with a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66GsW9"&gt;Xiaofang points out that since the cable included with the device is a USB-C to Lightning, it’s not compatible with the wall chargers that were previously included with Apple devices (via &lt;em&gt;Shanghai Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;). This means that customers will have to purchase a USB-C-compatible charger or a MagSafe charger if they don’t have one already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxHSQY"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;, Xiaofang claims that Apple is leaving out wall chargers to promote its MagSafe chargers, a line of magnetic chargers that powers your phone wirelessly. She alleges that Apple’s decision not to include a charger is motivated by profit, and that Apple is merely operating under the guise of saving the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6aYMwb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A year later, Apple’s MagSafe continues to underwhelm ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728967/apple-magsafe-duo-wallet-cases-charging"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="j5Bc3i"&gt;Xiaofang and her colleagues took Apple to the Beijing Internet Court, asking for Apple to provide a wall charger, as well as pay 100 yuan ($16) for breach of contract and for litigation fees (via &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;). As mentioned in the report by the &lt;em&gt;Shanghai Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;, a representative for Apple argued that it’s common for companies to sell phones without a charger and noted that the iPhone 12’s packaging makes it clear that no charger is included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFFHw1"&gt;The case is reportedly still in progress and has since gone viral on Chinese social media site Weibo, where the students have seen an outpouring of support (via &lt;a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202110/1237420.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Suing Apple for such a small sum may seem odd, but it’s the statement that matters. According to the report by &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt;, a Chinese student sued the Shanghai Disney Resort in 2019 for just 50 yuan ($7) for not letting customers bring food into the park — Disney later conceded and agreed to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uc0fCf"&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple has faced legal issues for not providing chargers. Earlier this year, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22342051/brazil-regulator-fines-apple-2-million-chargers-iphone-12"&gt;Brazilian regulator fined Apple $2 million&lt;/a&gt; for failing to include chargers with the iPhone 12, alleging that Apple is misleading the customer by selling it without one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music officially launches on the PS5</title>

  &lt;p id="uOoQoN"&gt;Apple Music is coming to a gaming console, and it’s &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/27/apple-music-launches-on-ps5-today/"&gt;the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;. The new app lets Apple Music subscribers stream music on Sony’s latest console, similar to what was already available with Spotify. Audio can play in the background while you’re gaming or just play on its own. Instructions on how to set up Apple Music for your PS5 are available &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/subscriptions/set-up-apple-music/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LN1ATV"&gt;This is the PS5’s second major integration with an Apple service; both Sony and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528372/ps5-streaming-apps-support-day-one-netflix-disney-plus-twitch"&gt;launched with the Apple TV Plus app last year&lt;/a&gt;. Sony extended the partnership to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588577/ps5-sony-apple-tv-plus-six-month-trial-subscription"&gt;six months of free Apple TV Plus membership&lt;/a&gt; to PS5 owners earlier this year. Having Apple Music on a console is a nice addition if you’re looking to simplify your TV setup and avoid having to switch too much between dedicated streaming boxes and built-in apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VmYJa"&gt;News of the PS5’s Apple Music app emerged after a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/q68jxg/since_when_was_this_a_thing_i_made_a_new_account/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link"&gt;Reddit user spotted&lt;/a&gt; the streaming service in the console’s music menu, and &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-14-it-looks-like-apple-music-may-be-coming-to-playstation-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; was subsequently able&lt;/a&gt; to get the icon to appear by creating a new account. Apple Music is also available on Android, Amazon Echo, Chrome OS, Sonos, the web, and of course, Apple’s own range of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new TVs will soon support Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6nn16Ht5TdjOu74_4qjvsD-Ztnw=/183x0:2430x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051650/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_7.38.51_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2RuB2k"&gt;Amazon is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662673/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-price-features"&gt;making its own TVs&lt;/a&gt;, and today marks the release of the company’s Omni and 4-Series Fire TVs. As the 4K HDR sets start making their way to customers, Amazon is making one more last-minute announcement: it plans to add support for Apple’s AirPlay 2 and HomeKit features “soon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAFoJJ"&gt;AirPlay 2 makes it easy to play content on the TV screen from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. And HomeKit integration will allow the Omni and 4-Series TVs to be controlled by Siri or the Home app; it also makes it easy to include them in smart home routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGUV78"&gt;Amazon has already rolled out AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/apple-airplay-2-and-homekit-now-available-on-toshiba-and-insignia-4k-uhd-smart-fire-tv-2020-models-89188a0b0fb3"&gt;some of its “Fire TV Edition” TVs from Toshiba and Insignia&lt;/a&gt;. Curiously, these features have yet to come to the company’s standalone Fire TV streaming devices — including the just-released Fire TV Stick 4K Max. I’m not sure if that’s an intentional choice, but it’s a bit odd that Amazon is ready to announce support on day one for its brand-new TVs with nothing to share about AirPlay 2 coming to its cheaper devices. (Roku supports AirPlay 2 on both its players and Roku TVs.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpXQrx"&gt;The Fire TV Omni series TVs offer the better picture quality of the two lines and come with built-in far-field microphones for hands-free Alexa voice commands. The 65-inch and 75-inch models support Dolby Vision HDR, though there are also smaller 43-, 50-, and 55-inch sizes available with HDR10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0D51s"&gt;Stay tuned for our impressions of Amazon’s first self-branded 4K TVs in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods (third-gen) review: new design, same appeal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new regular AirPods get a lot right even before the gimmicky spatial audio part&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mYTlYX"&gt;For the first time since their introduction in 2016, Apple’s AirPods have a completely new design. The third-generation AirPods, priced at $179, bear a much closer resemblance to the AirPods Pro than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;long-stemmed original&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-gen pairs&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has upgraded their sound, added new features like spatial audio head tracking, made them more durable with IPX4 water resistance, and lengthened their battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFDLaT"&gt;What remains unchanged about the AirPods is their ease of use and deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. If you’re living in Apple’s world, you still get exclusive features like the intuitive, just-hold-them-near-your-iPhone setup, audio sharing, automatic device switching, and other software tricks that have helped the AirPods stay atop the true wireless earbuds market by a wide margin. The third-generation AirPods also gain more extensive Find My support to help you locate them if they go missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iup0oN"&gt;The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max didn’t even exist the last time Apple refreshed its standard AirPods. So the third-gen earbuds also establish more feature parity across the entire lineup. There are definitely still reasons to pick those products instead — active noise cancellation, namely — but anyone who’s ready to upgrade their original AirPods will find a lot to like with the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LWOCkg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10826364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="444ptP"&gt;These AirPods basically look like the AirPods Pro with their ear tips chopped off. They share similar contours, especially now that Apple has shortened the stems by 33 percent. There are also grilled black speakers, mics, and vents around each earbud. These hardware elements have become so prominent that I’m surprised Apple isn’t offering the new AirPods in black to help camouflage them. But nope: they still only come in white. Since their design is now so similar, Apple carried over the “force sensor” controls from the AirPods Pro, with an indent on each stem that designates where to press. The tap gestures from the old AirPods are gone. Apple’s non-remappable controls handle media playback, and you can summon Siri with a long press. But you’ve also got hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands at your disposal for adjusting volume or changing up the playlist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfbDUX"&gt;Unlike the Pros, there are no silicone ear tips for a customizable fit: as with its previous standard AirPods, Apple sticks with a one-size-fits-most hard plastic design. They’re open-style earbuds that rest in your ears instead of extending deep into the ear canal. A lot of people love the barely there comfort of the AirPods. The main side effect of their open design is that they let in a ton of outside noise. For me, that’s always been a significant turnoff. But again, others value having the added awareness — be it for personal safety reasons or otherwise — and view this as an upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GOF4UNksPfsgjJRt-H2qZmI9HNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953794/IMG_0048_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods (below) are clearly cut from the same cloth as the AirPods Pro (above).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="die3Jr"&gt;Unfortunately, fit is where the old AirPods have always let me down. They just weren’t a good match for my large-ish ears and would come loose and fall out way too easily. All ears are different, and I know a ton of people who had no such issues. But I was expecting another round of disappointment when I put the third-gen AirPods into my ears for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nBcM1"&gt;Fortunately, the new shape fits my ears much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFVPQU"&gt;Apple says it conducted a ton of user research when designing the third-generation AirPods, involving thousands of ear scans, heat maps, and so on. And at least in my case, something about the new shape definitely works better. They’re staying put so well that I no longer feel the same anxiety about them tumbling onto the ground and down a sewer grate. That worry was always present with the older AirPods. The healthy dose of ambient sound remains, and I’m just someone who prefers earbuds that offer some quiet from the outside world. But I can finally say that Apple’s regular AirPods fit me, and that was never true previously. If you had issues with the original design, it’s worth giving these a try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woYRg7Y4GOzAoeIkIMHF92IN-90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953799/IMG_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new AirPods have much shorter stems than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBojuP"&gt;The charging case now opens in landscape — just like the case for the AirPods Pro — but it’s noticeably smaller than that one. It’s closer in overall size to the original AirPods case, though a smidge thicker. The case still has a Lightning port for wired charging, and it also supports Qi-compatible wireless chargers. Apple says the new AirPods case is designed to work with the company’s MagSafe chargers. And sure enough, it grabs onto the circular MagSafe charging pad with the same perfect alignment as an iPhone 12 or 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nISprs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the old AirPods never fit your ears, these might do the trick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8V0LTd"&gt;But don’t expect to charge your earbuds by placing them on the back of Apple’s MagSafe-ready iPhones: there’s no reverse wireless charging. And to drive that point home, Apple told me it intentionally designed the AirPods case so that it doesn’t magnetically latch onto the back of those phones. You’ll feel some pull when sliding the case around the back of the phone, but it’s nowhere near enough force to keep the two attached. As for the actual battery life, Apple says the third-gen AirPods can hit six hours of continuous playback and a total of 30 hours counting case recharges. That’s a modest improvement over the five hours and “over 24 hours” estimates from the previous model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiGbOD"&gt;Both the AirPods and their case are now rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance. Plenty of people used the older generations for workouts, but the official certification gives added peace of mind if you’ll frequently be using these AirPods as a gym companion. There’s also a new “skin detection sensor” on each earbud that replaces the old IR sensor. It still tells the AirPods to pause when removed from your ears (or resume when placed back in), but Apple says this sensor can tell the difference between your ears or tight spaces like a pants pocket that might’ve fooled the previous AirPods into resuming playback if you put them in there without the case. It’s not difficult to envision future evolutions of this sensor tying into Apple’s health and fitness efforts. But for now it’s just there to make auto-pause more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFY7Ex"&gt;Apple has completely redesigned the acoustic driver and amplifier in the third-gen AirPods. The company told me it aimed to give them a sound profile similar to the AirPods Pro. There’s only so much you can do with open-style earbuds to improve bass performance; these will never pack the same low-end punch as many upscale in-ear buds. But the new AirPods do sound noticeably fuller and more dynamic than their predecessors — and yes, very similar to the Pros. In the right ways, they still sound like AirPods, and they’re tuned to work equally well for music, watching videos, podcasts, games, and so on. But Apple says music is still far and away the leading thing people use their AirPods for, so it’s trying to deliver the best audio quality possible in this form factor. I’ve found that the open design often leads to a more spacious soundstage. The AirPods are still handily outperformed by top-tier earbuds like Sony’s WF-1000XM4 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, but among other buds with an open design, they’re up there with the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WK-mSuFuVOg5iUNkHQdRI1SwPYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953803/IMG_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods have redesigned drivers and support spatial audio with head tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lfClhR"&gt;To further enhance their sound, the new AirPods use the same adaptive EQ feature as the Pros and Max. There’s an inward-facing mic on each earbud that analyzes what you’re hearing and, so Apple claims, adjusts the output in real time to what’s best for your unique ear shape. But the thing about adaptive EQ is that it’s impossible to ever really know when it’s doing something — or what that something is. It’s invisible to the listener at all times, so there’s not much to say about it. There’s no telling whether the improved sound is due to the redesigned drivers, the inclusion of adaptive EQ, or a combination of both. The third-gen AirPods do a better job of steering audio into your ears, which also helps achieve that full-bodied sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPpQJ6"&gt;But that brings us to the big trick Apple is advertising with the new AirPods: spatial audio with head tracking. Like the AirPods Pro and Max, the third-gen pair can dynamically adjust the sound in each earbud as you turn your head from side to side, keeping the sound source anchored to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV you’re watching. When you’re watching movies in Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, or other popular apps, this head tracking can be an immersive, fun experience and mimics surround sound better than a regular stereo mix would. It really does add to the satisfaction of watching movies on my iPad Pro. And for those times when someone’s asleep at home and you can’t take advantage of your soundbar or surround system on the Apple TV, you can listen in private with AirPods and spatial audio head tracking. Apple has also thought of other use cases: on group FaceTime calls, spatial audio creates a sound field that places the voices where they’re positioned on your device’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HUXc0F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’re still in the early days of spatial audio — and you can tell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="683JZk"&gt;But when it comes to music, it all feels far more gimmicky. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;I’ve written about Apple Music’s Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; before, and everything there applies here. The feature works with all headphones, but only the third-gen AirPods, Pros, and Max add head tracking to the equation. That doesn’t really change where I stand on it. Spatial audio mixes can often sound objectively worse than their stereo counterparts. It takes a lot of work from engineers and producers to get the most from Atmos, and it remains obvious that a lot of albums available in spatial audio on Apple Music haven’t gotten that level of attention. Instruments and effects can sound out of place, vocals can get drowned out in the mix, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1oiF2"&gt;The situation is improving as newer records are mixed for Atmos from the get-go. (And Atmos mixes do generally sound a lot better on actual Atmos home theater systems.) The recent Giles Martin remix of &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt; by The Beatles takes advantage of spatial audio well without trying to do too much. It has that feeling of being in the room with the band. But other examples, like Kacey Musgraves’ &lt;em&gt;Star-Crossed&lt;/em&gt;, don’t do anything for me that I don’t already get from the stereo version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BrGfV"&gt;In short, spatial audio can wow when it comes to video, but we’re still in the very early stages of the music side — and it’s not a reason to buy these earbuds yet. Apple makes it easy to switch back and forth between spatial audio and regular sound in Control Center. And iOS 15 actually lets you “spatialize” sound from apps like Spotify that don’t otherwise offer the feature. I guess that’s nice to have if you really find yourself loving this new way of listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W73EEHXIiB114uTu-QbiD6XBZUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953861/IMG_0049_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like all AirPods before them, the third-gen earbuds are positioned as the perfect iPhone accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajGJmS"&gt;The AirPods have long been the champion of voice calls, and with the third-gen set, Apple is trying to improve the fidelity of FaceTime calls by using a new AAC-ELD codec for clearer voice reproduction. There’s also acoustic mesh on the outward-facing side of each AirPod that’s meant to reduce wind noise. Despite the shorter stems, overall microphone performance remains excellent and the new AirPods remain easy to recommend if you want earbuds that guarantee you’ll come through clearly on calls. Stay tuned for our video review for the full mic test — with Becca, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1Vctld"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10826383"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1Oafy"&gt;Apple has also given the new AirPods a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;deeper level of integration with its Find My app&lt;/a&gt;. You could always play a sound to find a missing (nearby) earbud or see the location where they were last connected to your phone. But now the third-gen AirPods get the same “find nearby” feature as the AirPods Pro and Max. This is an AirTags-like interface for pinpointing where the AirPods are if you’re in close proximity to them. It’s not as accurate as an AirTag, but the UI will tell you when the AirPods are “nearby” and then show “here” when you’re right near them. If they’re really nowhere to be found, you can also now enable lost mode and be alerted if your missing AirPods come within range of millions of other iOS devices. My favorite of the new Find My features are the separation alerts that automatically pop up if you leave your AirPods behind somewhere. That alone should prevent a lot of heartbreak and lost earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aimgs"&gt;The new AirPods are the first big redesign of Apple’s massively popular true wireless earbuds. From a fit and comfort standpoint, I think Apple succeeded: these are still wonderfully lightweight earbuds, and they actually stay in my ears now. The sound quality has seen some refinement, and the third-gen AirPods are a better gym buddy than their predecessors. Plus you’ve got longer battery life and nice-to-have features like spatial audio head tracking — even if Apple is overselling it a bit. I’ll personally be sticking with the AirPods Pro and other earbuds that offer noise cancellation or at least some isolation. But if you prefer the open-style AirPods and have an older pair that can’t hold a charge anymore, these are a worthwhile upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Y3dZlM"&gt;But before you go getting locked deeper into Apple’s ecosystem, it’s worth exploring your options. The game has changed a lot since the second-gen AirPods were released, and it’s possible to find better sound quality among competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637548/oneplus-buds-pro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and others. If you can do without the frills, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;spend much less and still be happy&lt;/a&gt;. Still, if you’ve got an iPhone, none of those can deliver the same seamless experience as the AirPods. They’re still designed to perfectly complement Apple’s smartphone, and in that regard they don’t disappoint. Perhaps more than any other Apple product today, AirPods still just work. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple seems to have forgotten it built a notch in the MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fzIU2sWM9jTd-nqoUNbHC4KQRXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051450/akrales_211020_4803_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUpwvb"&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pro notch is misbehaving. Early adopters have discovered inconsistencies in how Apple handles the notch across macOS and in individual apps, resulting in unexpected behavior where status bar items can get hidden under the notch. These inconsistencies make it feel like Apple has forgotten, in areas of macOS, that it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;built a notch into the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWuMbY"&gt;Snazzy Labs owner Quinn Nelson has posted two videos on Twitter demonstrating some of the early notch issues. The main video demonstrates what appears to be a bug in macOS. Status bar items like Apple’s battery indicator can get hidden underneath the notch when status bar items are extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NQyk9a"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WHO DESIGNED THIS?!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/ADVqmfdqV2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ADVqmfdqV2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Quinn Nelson (@SnazzyQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143798251339778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fuoITI"&gt;Nelson demonstrates this with iStat Menus, which can be hidden under the notch or can force system items like the battery indicator to be hidden underneath the notch. While Apple has issued guidance to developers on how to work with the notch, the developer behind iStat Menus says the app is just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bjango/status/1453171506263982087"&gt;using standard status items&lt;/a&gt; and that Apple’s dev guidance “won’t solve the issue presented in the video.” This doesn’t appear to be intended behavior, as the notch works differently inside certain apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTy9Dr"&gt;Nelson also highlights how an older version of DaVinci Resolve avoids the notch. In apps that haven’t been updated for the notch, you can’t even move your mouse pointer into it. Apple blocks off this space so that older apps can’t display menu items underneath the notch. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/27/macbook-pro-notch-problem-status-items/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that this behavior is inconsistent across the rest of macOS, though, so if you have Finder in focus then the cursor can get lost behind the notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYjzzm"&gt;The notch can also exacerbate existing macOS issues. Apps like DaVinci Resolve (with extended menu items) can take over the space used by system status items. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/macbook-pro-notch-menu-bar-behavior/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; this is regular macOS behavior, but that the notch obviously reduces the amount of space for both the menu items and status items. It’s an ongoing issue that has spawned apps like &lt;a href="https://www.macbartender.com/"&gt;Bartender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt; to help manage the macOS menu bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fIN0Ud"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new MacBook Pro has a notch ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"},{"title":"Apple botched the MacBook Pro notch ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734676/apple-macbook-pro-notch-botch-face-id-missing-feature-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LuBPiE"&gt;It’s not clear how Apple will address these inconsistencies, even as developers update their regular apps to work around the notch. Thankfully, these problems will be extremely rare and will only likely appear in apps with lots of menu or status items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6ji0r"&gt;Either way, it’s odd this wasn’t a design consideration ahead of the MacBook Pro launch. As &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1453145302836256771"&gt;Dieter Bohn puts it&lt;/a&gt;: “Soooo the team in charge of Menu Items in apps was read in on the notch, but the team in charge of Menu Status items was not? lol”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WZSfw"&gt;In other words, don’t blame app developers, it’s notch always gonna be their fault.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp’s iPhone-to-Android chat transfer is now available on Pixels and new phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eokNaSp9B-H9bsj4lLIBmWdnKU=/193x0:1246x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049386/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_13.51.42.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hphf2u"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/whatsapp-chat-history/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that WhatsApp’s chat history migration feature to bring your messages from iPhones to Android is now available on “all Pixel phones” and that it’ll “become available on new smartphones that launch with Android 12.” The feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619664/whatsapp-android-ios-chat-history-transfer-cross-platform"&gt;already available for Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt; but will make the experience of switching from iOS to Android easier, as you won’t have to give up your messaging history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwYNJK"&gt;The process should be relatively simple, as long as you’ve got WhatsApp up to date on both your iPhone and Android phone, and you’ve got a USB-C to Lightning cable handy. Google says that while setting up your Android phone, you’ll be prompted to scan a QR code with your iPhone, which will let you start the transfer process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VsnZRcl9RuhTCPdNKO3gbNGB6OQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957797/WhatsAppBlogAsset_LightTheme.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wired connection and QR code scan are all that’s required to start the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

Google says that your iPhone won’t receive any WhatsApp messages while your messages are moving, so you shouldn’t lose anything in the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdlIkh"&gt;Google says that phone OEMs can add support for the feature when updating their phones to Android 12, so it’s possible those with existing phones will gain access to it at some point. The company says that it’s working with phone makers to ensure that phones that ship with Android 12 support the transfers out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN3V75"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated October 26th, 8:34PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information from Google about support for the feature on existing phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MacBook Pro is a GPU-shaped warning to Nvidia and AMD</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mmlVNDsKIAhqUza-_i6xJ_8tdt4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048510/akrales_211020_4803_0047.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iPuU28"&gt;Apple hit Intel hard with its first M1 chips, offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;rare step-change improvement in performance&lt;/a&gt; with its 2020 MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. Less than a year later, it’s already starting to compete with the best GPUs from AMD and Nvidia as well. The new MacBook Pros with M1 Pro and M1 Max offer a first glimpse at how well Apple’s M1 chips can scale to provide raw performance that rivals the discrete graphics cards we typically find inside Windows-powered laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLeQQw"&gt;Nvidia has been trying to woo many of Apple’s professional and creative customers with its Studio laptops, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future"&gt;Apple has not only managed to fix the mistakes it made&lt;/a&gt; with its MacBook port selection and keyboard, but it’s also scaled up its M1 chips to meet the performance expectations of 14- and 16-inch laptops, too. The result has creative professionals excited, and it’s easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UUNIH"&gt;While Windows laptops had looked increasingly tempting to the Mac crowd over the past five years, Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"&gt;shift the balance&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in the GPU realm. They look like early warning shots at the AMD- and Nvidia-powered competition. Apple seems confident it can deliver the same performance as a top discrete graphics card while consuming a lot less power. This is all part of Apple’s ambitious plan to transition its Mac lineup fully to Apple Silicon by the end of 2022 and just a glimpse at what the company must have coming to its most powerful Mac, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;the towering Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3NMZD146QLPkU6KkUTonwrSOcxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956209/appleGPUcomparison.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has compared its M1 Max to two RTX 3080 laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7V070m"&gt;Apple proudly compared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;its new M1 Max chip&lt;/a&gt; to two high-end Windows laptops last week, claiming the M1 Max is able to use 100W less power and offer the same relative performance at close to or above Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 mobile chip. While the M1 Max might be Apple’s largest chip it has ever made, it’s still integrating the graphics into a system-on-a-chip (SoC) architecture, compared to the dedicated and separate RTX 3080 cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8k7Ko"&gt;While there are caveats, it wasn’t just talk: early reviews seem to back up some of Apple’s claims. &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17024/apple-m1-max-performance-review/6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that both the M1 Pro and M1 Max perform well on productivity-focused loads, with a GFXBench test even putting it close to beating an RTX 3080 laptop equipped with Intel’s Core i9-11980HK &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;flagship notebook processor&lt;/a&gt;. These are the types of loads you’d expect the M1 Max to perform well in, especially given Apple’s work on improving its chips for productivity tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHZKCi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhqCC70ZfDM"&gt;YouTuber Dave2D found&lt;/a&gt; the M1 Max was slightly slower than a comparable RTX 3080 system for Adobe Premiere Pro tasks and that M1 Max performance depends on the work involved. While an Adobe Premiere Pro render took 10 minutes and 17 seconds in Dave2D’s testing, an identical render took just 4 minutes and 16 seconds using Apple’s Final Cut Pro software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqiWIb"&gt;Where the M1 Max and M1 Pro really fall down is in gaming. The M1 Max performs similarly to an RTX 3060 system in &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider. &lt;/em&gt;While midrange gaming might be impressive for an SoC, it’s disappointing compared to Apple’s claims because an RTX 3060 is a notable step down from an RTX 3070, let alone an RTX 3080. &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17024/apple-m1-max-performance-review/6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt;’s tests&lt;/a&gt; also show the flagship M1 Max offering less than half the performance of an RTX 3080 laptop in &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt;. We’re still reviewing Apple’s latest MacBook Pros, but we’ve also found the M1 Max is mostly comparable to an RTX 3060 notebook for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Fi17v5i2_3h2Opzpj16rn7JBP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948080/akrales_211020_4803_0024.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros include some impressive GPU performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yAArlN"&gt;Given most macOS cross-platform games are still x86 and the fact macOS has never really been a platform for gaming, it’s no surprise to see the M1 Max struggling here. So another way to think about it is that Apple’s &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; matching the RTX 3060 without the benefit of game developers optimizing for its M1 chips. That’s an impressive start for Apple, even if there’s no indication yet that the Mac will attract optimized games in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUD5Qj"&gt;It’s also impressive when you consider the power draw and thermal headroom involved. We’ve already seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt;the difference a fan can make&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13-inch model&lt;/a&gt; compared to the fanless MacBook Air. Now, we’re seeing what it can do with a 140W power adapter and a larger 14- or 16-inch chassis to dissipate the heat. What could Apple do in an iMac or Mac Pro, with plenty of time and plenty of room to build an even bigger and better GPU with fewer thermal and power constraints? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNGgfz"&gt;“It’s clear that Apple’s ongoing experience with GPUs has paid off with the development of their A-series chips, and now their M1 family of SoCs,” writes &lt;em&gt;Anandtech’s&lt;/em&gt; Andrei Frumusanu. “Put succinctly, the new M1 SoCs prove that Apple can build the kind of big and powerful GPUs that they need for their high-end machines. AMD and NVIDIA need not apply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An5Yv9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1450233957350576129"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reporter Mark Gurman says&lt;/a&gt; those bigger chips are already coming, with Apple designing two variations for the next desktop Mac Pro that offer “2x and 4x the number of CPU and GPU cores as the M1 Max.” That will result in up to 40 CPU cores and up to 128 GPU cores on the very high-end Mac Pro models, and it will be the real test of Apple’s ability to scale its M1 advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j1U9aP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For those who think the M1 Pro and M1 Max in the MacBook Pro are impressive, the new Mac Pro desktop is expected to come in at least two variations: 2X and 4X the number of CPU and GPU cores as the M1 Max. That’s up to 40 CPU cores and 128 GPU cores on the high-end.&lt;/p&gt;— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1450233957350576129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dZeXgC"&gt;AMD currently supplies Radeon Pro GPUs inside Apple’s existing Mac Pro models, and if Apple’s core count and performance can scale well on the GPU side, then it’s easy to see how Apple’s own GPUs could blow past &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/graphics/radeon-apple-w6000x-series"&gt;AMD’s Radeon PRO W6000X&lt;/a&gt; cards. Apple is already close to mobile RTX 3080s in some tasks with the M1 Max — we’re looking forward to seeing what it will do when Apple’s chip designers can focus less on mobility and more on cooling its hardware for maximum performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKTRDh"&gt;If more software and even games become optimized to take advantage of the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, and Apple’s desktop chips deliver the performance improvements we’ve seen so far with M1, Apple could be on course to redefine the performance expectations of desktop PCs, just like it redefined the expectations around laptop chips late last year. &lt;/p&gt;
