    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iMaorN"&gt;Qualcomm has just made a &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/01/13/qualcomm-acquire-nuvia?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWm1RMk1qazFOV0ZqT1dWaCIsInQiOiJpdWM0WjJIUitvMlgxOHNvS1Y2WWY3VXBBQ2xZY0lSd1I1eXNRdVpIRVJNcXlEd2d1QlZKcUljMHl4WnhDYmgrRWhcL3Irc3VFTEo3M3lLUDVQUHQzZUdaS3BtTUZlTitXMTB5bEFhdXZoRWlieGZ4d3QwM2lVS1FoNDVyYWVSOU8ifQ%3D%3D"&gt;splashy acquisition&lt;/a&gt; in the chip market that’s sure to shake up the semiconductor industry in substantial fashion. The company Qualcomm is purchasing, Nuvia, was formed in 2019 by three former engineers and chip specialists, all of whom &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/three-of-apple-and-googles-former-star-chip-designers-launch-nuvia-with-53m-in-series-a-funding/"&gt;worked at Apple on the A-series chip line that powers the iPhone and iPad&lt;/a&gt;. And now, Qualcomm is paying an eye-popping $1.4 billion for the firm, placing a huge bet on the team’s talent and its focus on building next-generation CPUs for use in data centers, mobile, and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdD4RT"&gt;Qualcomm is specifically calling out the growth of 5G as one of the reasons it’s paying such a handsome sum for a company of just a couple hundred employees founded only two years ago. “5G is further accelerating the convergence of mobility and computing. The acquisition of Nuvia builds on Qualcomm Technologies’ Snapdragon technology leadership, delivering step-function improvements in CPU performance and power efficiency to meet the demands of next-generation 5G computing,” Qualcomm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMpB2x"&gt;All three of the company’s co-founders — Gerard Williams, Manu Gulati, and John Bruno — will be joining Qualcomm, which expects to integrate the company’s chips “across Qualcomm Technologies’ broad portfolio of products,” including the components that make their way into data centers, smartphones, laptops, vehicles, and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p7npXr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nuvia is just two years old, but Qualcomm is paying $1.4 billion to acquire its technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5vI10"&gt;“CPU performance leadership will be critical in defining and delivering on the next era of computing innovation,” Nuvia CEO Gerard Williams, formerly chief CPU architect at Apple, said in a statement. “The combination of Nuvia and Qualcomm will bring the industry’s best engineering talent, technology and resources together to create a new class of high-performance computing platforms that set the bar for our industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twDKSg"&gt;Qualcomm is collecting tech and talent and taking aim at the data center industry at a time of significant change in the chip market. Many companies that once used to rely on big-name chipmakers like AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm have spent much of the last decade building out their own internal chip design teams to lessen their reliance on third-party companies and to better integrate their hardware and software. This is true not just of Apple, at which Nuvia’s co-founders gained their expertise, but also Amazon, Google, Facebook, and others, too. (Nuvia’s other two co-founders worked on chip design at Google, too.) All of these companies are building their own chips for use in everything from data centers to smart speakers and everything in between, often licensing the Arm architecture to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZcE2Q"&gt;That’s put Qualcomm at odds with companies it used to consider core partners. Apple and Qualcomm, in fact, engaged in a bitter multiyear patent infringement legal battle the two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410985/apple-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute-patent-licensing-terms-high-fees"&gt;settled in 2019,&lt;/a&gt; but the message was clear: Apple was tired of paying other companies to license their tech and would rather go it alone using Arm-based designs. That was only further cemented by Apple’s landmark decision to drop Intel in the CPU field for Apple’s own custom-designed line of M1 processors, which arrived on the scene last fall powering the first of many new Apple computers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;critical acclaim thanks to their huge performance gains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWPZV7"&gt;While Apple and Qualcomm cut a deal for the iPhone maker to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525962/qualcomm-apple-settlement-4-5-billion-dollars-patent"&gt;continue using Qualcomm’s modems&lt;/a&gt;, including its 5G ones that enable the network capabilities on the latest iPhones, Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168779/apple-leak-cellular-modem-johny-srouji-town-hall"&gt;reportedly hard at work on building its own cellular modems&lt;/a&gt; to further extricate itself from Qualcomm in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="auSOKt"&gt;And that’s where a company like Nuvia comes in. While many companies are building their own Arm-based CPUs to compete with AMD and Intel in the data center — like &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd"&gt;Amazon’s Graviton chip&lt;/a&gt; — Nuvia is &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-raises-240-million-to-design-arm-based-cpus-for-datacenters/"&gt;reportedly building a more flexible custom chip core&lt;/a&gt; (also based on Arm) called Phoenix. That chip core could result in a variety of different CPUs down the line, not just those designed to act as data center processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWkUEz"&gt;“We’re designing our own core from the ground up,” Williams &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-raises-240-million-to-design-arm-based-cpus-for-datacenters/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat &lt;/em&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the company raised $240 million in a Series B funding round. “Our secret sauce is really physical design capabilities and microarchitecture. And that’s where you see the differentiation coming into play for almost anybody that builds a processor.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAsNbS"&gt;Williams said at the time that the speed and efficiency of its chip core was “very much like a mobile core in terms of size and power,” but with with “substantially higher” performance, a prescient statement to make considering Qualcomm’s plans to use Nuvia technology in its mobile Snapdragon system-on-a-chip line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="kKDn2C"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6p1Qub"&gt;The best deal right now on the Apple Watch SE 40mm with GPS is at Amazon, which has knocked $9 off its normal price in gold or space gray, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f487a960520964ac860d89f77404bb1b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;price down to $270&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b1bbcc98b9b514babd7b0198463cd917&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$270 in space gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f16e9235da90ab510af5e23d08d74daf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$280 for silver with a white band&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b1bbcc98b9b514babd7b0198463cd917&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$294 for gold&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin wireless charger sold by Apple is being recalled for fire hazards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/auIZmerAseUZlB7ENAjX5ZRmgHI=/9x0:674x443/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68663023/Screen_Shot_2021_01_13_at_11.10.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m7NpHH"&gt;Belkin is voluntarily recalling its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fsupport-article%3FarticleNum%3D317696&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F13%2F22229147%2Fapple-belkin-recall-wireless-charging-stand-fire-shock-hazard#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Portable Wireless Charger + Stand Special Edition&lt;/a&gt; that was sold in Apple retail stores and online on Apple and Belkin’s sites because of fire and shock safety hazards. No incidents or injuries have been connected to the charger, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Belkin-Recalls-Portable-Wireless-Chargers-Stand-Special-Edition-Due-to-Fire-and-Shock-Hazards"&gt;the Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt;, and the malfunction should only affect chargers sold between July 2020 and October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xiCAu"&gt;The wireless charging stand has a 10,000mAh power capacity and can charge at 10W speed for phones that support it, but an issue with the “power supply unit” could cause the device to overheat and leave it vulnerable to catching fire or shocking people. Belkin is advising anyone who’s purchased the device to stop using it and unplug it from power. The company will also issue refunds to anyone who owns an affected charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AnByf"&gt;In the grand scheme of Apple’s iPhones, wireless charging has only been available since the 2017 launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017"&gt;iPhone 8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review"&gt;iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;. Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16278310/apple-iphone-8-wireless-charging"&gt;AirPower&lt;/a&gt; at the same event, a wireless charging mat that was supposed to charge multiple devices at once, but it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;ultimately canceled&lt;/a&gt; because it didn’t meet Apple’s “high standards.” Rumors later pointed to issues with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869072/apple-airpower-overheating-issues"&gt;the device’s charging coils overheating&lt;/a&gt; as part of the motivation for Apple canceling. All of this to say, wireless charging is harder than it looks, and Belkin’s recall is yet another example of issues that can arise in a deceptively simple product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJEUoA"&gt;If you own a charger affected by the recall, you can submit a form to request a refund on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fwiz003recallform%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F13%2F22229147%2Fapple-belkin-recall-wireless-charging-stand-fire-shock-hazard#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin’s support site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s first major racial equity investments include a Detroit developer center and HBCU tech hub</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqB2hEUoyV4fu7JPXwzaF6MrS50=/225x0:2655x1620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68660972/apple_racial_equity_justice_initiative_propel_center_render_01132021_Full_Bleed_Image.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A render of the Propel Center. | Image: Propel Center&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Trabhq"&gt;Apple is announcing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fapple-launches-major-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-projects-to-challenge-systemic-racism-advance-racial-equity-nationwide%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F13%2F22228580%2Fapple-detroit-developer-academy-equity-center-hbcu-tech-hub#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the next big investments&lt;/a&gt; to come out of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287999/apple-racial-equity-justice-initiative-amount-cook-lisa-jackson"&gt;$100 million commitment to racial equity and justice today&lt;/a&gt;: the launch of an Apple Developer Academy in Detroit; founding support for an Atlanta tech hub for historically Black colleges and universities; and new grants, scholarships, and investments for Black and brown students and entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxDIzQ"&gt;The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit will be the “first of its kind in the US,” Apple wrote in a press release, after previously partnering on &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/16/apple-developer-academy/"&gt;a similar program&lt;/a&gt; in Italy. The academy is focused on “young Black entrepreneurs, creators, and coders” and will offer training in iOS app development. The plan is to offer a shorter 30-day program that introduces students to “what it means to be a developer” and then to offer an “intensive” 10- to 12- month program meant to help aspiring developers gain relevant skills to get tech jobs or start their own businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="g6ARRI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Propel Center will offer in-person and online courses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WgMimC"&gt;Apple expects the academy to teach around 1,000 students each year. It’s supposed to open later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QmSuM"&gt;In Atlanta, Apple is partnering to help launch the Propel Center, a tech-focused hub for HBCUs. The center will offer in-person and online courses focused on technology, entertainment, and business. It’ll be located in the Atlanta University Center that links four HBCUs — Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College, Morehouse College, and the Morehouse School of Medicine. Apple and Southern Company, an Atlanta-based energy giant, will each contribute $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P64QZI"&gt;Other tech companies and major donors have made similar contributions to HBCUs over the past year. In September, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-09-17-IBM-Establishes-First-Quantum-Education-and-Research-Initiative-for-Historically-Black-Colleges-and-Universities"&gt;IBM announced&lt;/a&gt; it was putting $100 million into technology, skill development, and other resources for HBCUs alongside the launch of an “IBM Quantum education and research initiative.” The same month, Michael Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/business/dealbook/bloomberg-black-medical-schools-donation.html"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to give $100 million to four historically Black medical schools, focused on easing student debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ew5eF"&gt;Apple also announced a number of new grants and investments today. It’s investing $10 million with Harlem Capital, a VC firm with the goal of “investing in 1,000 diverse founders over the next 20 years,” and $25 million in Siebert Williams Shank’s Clear Vision Impact Fund, which is focused on minority-owned businesses. Apple is launching grants for HBCU engineering programs and is expanding its scholarship program with a focus on underrepresented communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZlE5d"&gt;Today’s announcements are part of a $100 million commitment Apple made in June 2020, as companies across the US began reflecting on how they could better combat racism following the death of George Floyd and protests against police brutality. Apple VP Lisa Jackson was put in charge of the initiative, which was meant to “challenge the systemic barriers to opportunity and dignity that exists for communities of color and particular for the black community,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bn6s6v"&gt;Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;have made similar pledges&lt;/a&gt;, putting millions of dollars toward racial equity initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exclusive: Apple held talks with EV startup Canoo in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbwGAeCNL-Dc9hiPI5oafigJnsA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658125/canoo_Design_Exterior_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tOxNU7"&gt;Apple held meetings with California EV startup Canoo in the first half of 2020 as part of the Silicon Valley giant’s secretive effort to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;advance its own electric vehicle project&lt;/a&gt;, three people familiar with the talks have told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The two companies discussed options ranging from investment to an acquisition, according to two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcBkxi"&gt;Canoo’s scalable electric vehicle platform, or “skateboard,” is largely what drew Apple’s interest, the people said. The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9bfWU"&gt;Canoo was more interested in taking on an investment from Apple, two of the people said. Ultimately, the talks fell apart. Canoo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;since become a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt; after merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;blank check fund&lt;/a&gt; that was listed on the NASDAQ in late 2020. Apple has made at least one other acquisition in the mobility space in recent years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;buying Drive.ai in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq1mYL"&gt;“Canoo doesn’t openly comment on strategic discussions, relationships or partnerships unless deemed appropriate,” Tony Aquila, Canoo’s executive chairman, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7rcEe2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The talks happened at a crucial financial moment for Canoo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7BVy8"&gt;News of Apple’s interest in Canoo comes as &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that the tech company is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hyundai-motor-apple/apple-hyundai-set-to-agree-electric-car-tie-up-says-korea-it-news-idUSKBN29F0C1"&gt;negotiating with Hyundai to make a self-driving electric vehicle as early as 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s vehicle project, codenamed “Project Titan,” has shapeshifted multiple times over the years. But the company has now &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/apple-s-aapl-tesla-tsla-killer-won-t-ship-for-at-least-half-a-decade?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reportedly refocused on making an autonomous electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and has been holding meetings with automakers as small as Canoo and as big as Hyundai as it looks to outsource things like technical design and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ostxcV"&gt;Hyundai and Canoo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia"&gt;previously announced a plan to co-develop electric vehicles in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though that project appears to be unrelated to the startup’s talks with Apple. Canoo refers to its partnership with Hyundai in recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an “engineering services agreement” that will see the companies co-develop a platform to power a “small segment electric vehicle.” But Canoo has not disclosed whether it has been paid for the Hyundai deal, or whether any work has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1sE4y"&gt;Canoo was founded in late 2017 by a small group that split out from struggling EV startup Faraday Future, including multiple former BMW executives. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported, the effort was funded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20899436/discrimination-lawsuit-canoo-foreign-backers-ev-startup-british-chinese-government"&gt;a Chinese investor who is the son-in-law of a former CCP leader&lt;/a&gt;, and the family in charge of Taiwanese tech company TPK, which supplies touchscreen technology to Apple. Canoo plans to make commercial electric vehicles, like delivery vans or food trucks, as well as a consumer-focused van that will be sold on a subscription basis. All of Canoo’s vehicles are powered by that same scalable skateboard technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THdRzC"&gt;The talks with Apple came at a crucial time for Canoo, which lost $182.3 million in 2019 while working on its first prototype vehicle and entered 2020 with just $29 million in the bank, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000121390020041124/f424b31220_hennessycapacq4.htm#TOC001"&gt;a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="tB6p7P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Canoo met with companies and investors across Silicon Valley and China before going public&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QCWDDY"&gt;Canoo took meetings with a variety of companies from Silicon Valley, China, and elsewhere in 2019 and 2020, the people said. But as deals failed to materialize, the startup needed short-term money. It took a $7 million loan from the government’s pandemic Paycheck Protection Program and, as talks with Apple dragged on, another $15 million total from Pak Tam Li (the Chinese investor) and the Chiang family (the owners of TPK) in March 2020, according to the SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwAYXs"&gt;Canoo eventually started negotiations with the blank check fund, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV, later in the year. It was one of the first startups to jump on this trend of using a so-called “special purpose acquisition company” to shortcut the traditional path to becoming publicly traded. As that deal was worked out, the Chiang family put another $80 million into the startup, and the soon-to-be executive chairman invested $35 million, according to the SEC filing. Canoo raised some $600 million when the deal closed near the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUb0V0"&gt;While Canoo now has the money it sought at the beginning of 2020, that hasn’t softened its ambitions to work with big companies like Apple. The startup said in that same SEC filing that it is “currently in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging Canoo’s technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KugtI1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-965" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6-IseMU-VKzo5xzTTBT8BVk65z1R7t_lZHR-ApDuYug7wocNVuNr-RoCuiUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6z1zgThWDp2tf3j60kOubPIybm5uNl4EBzedCsO2Rm4cjFVJV1QJbxoCUaAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you want the lowest price for these wireless earbuds and don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2F-%2F6394628.p%3Fu1%3D%255B%255Dvg%255Be%255D21988756%255Br%255Dtheverge.com%252Fauthors%255Bt%255Dw%255Bd%255DD&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>PopSockets are going MagSafe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oqLxpCKYCBBhu2JRX1hanIDgQxw=/0x20:552x388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652647/1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: PopSockets&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iUXKXO"&gt;PopSockets is announcing that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/popsockets-unveils-innovation-at-ces-2021-including-magsafe-solutions-301205556.html"&gt;making its iconic phone holders compatible with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;. When Apple announced that accessories would be able to attach to the iPhone 12 with MagSafe, many people immediately thought of PopSockets — including &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/popsockets-is-working-on-magsafe-compatible-iphone-accessories/"&gt;the company itself&lt;/a&gt;, which announced it was working on adding compatibility. Now, it’s finally at the point where it’s putting out an announcement and a release window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keD1sS"&gt;PopSockets is planning on bringing MagSafe to quite a few of its products, but first, of course, is the famous &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsockets.com%2Fshop%2Fpopgrip&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225701%2Fpopsockets-magsafe-accessory#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PopGrip&lt;/a&gt;. Now, if you want to charge your phone wirelessly, you won’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21048205/popsockets-poppower-home-wireless-charger-popgrip-ces-2020"&gt;buy PopSockets’ specialized wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;. The MagSafe version will have a larger base than many PopSockets users may be used to, which is probably to provide space for the “no-slip” rubber bottom. Hopefully, that will keep the PopSocket from sliding off when going in and out of your pocket, like Apple’s own MagSafe wallet is somewhat infamous for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm7Iga"&gt;Speaking of wallets, PopSockets is also announcing a magnetic version of its PopWallet Plus, which is essentially a wallet with a PopSocket built in. Like Apple’s version, it will include a shield meant to protect any cards that are liable to get erased by magnets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRW3XF"&gt;In addition, PopSockets is unveiling two mounts that will use MagSafe: one for home (dubbed “Multi-Surface) and one for the car. The company notes that the new PopGrips will work with existing PopSocket mounts, but the new mounts will work magnetically, though it’s not clear if they’ll also use the PopSocket as an extra mechanical grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PiGw4z"&gt;The press announcement had some other notable products, including an antimicrobial version of the PopGrip (it’s a sign of the times), and a multitool PopGrip that’s a collaboration with famed knifesmith SOG. The PopGrip and PopWallet Plus for MagSafe are slated to launch in spring of 2021, and the PopMounts should be coming in the summer. No word has been released on pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s second MagSafe dock drops the Apple Watch charger and the price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EazKyFOGOUrWVsR6XKEG2a6VMAU=/240x0:1440x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650761/2in1_MagSafe_lifestyle2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mapDzk"&gt;Since Apple’s reveal of its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe charging standard&lt;/a&gt;, officially approved wireless chargers that use the standard have been few and far between. But Belkin is boosting those numbers with its new BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charger, which also brings a more palatable $99.95 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfEv2n"&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 3-in-1 Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, the BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charger — as you might be able to already guess — can charge two products instead of three. Now, the futuristic charging tree will offer just a MagSafe pad and a regular Qi charger for your AirPods (or any other device that fits), dropping the Apple Watch charger found on the 3-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aRpqEr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Belkin’s first MagSafe products are a wild-looking 3-in-1 charger and a car mount","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NhmgKk"&gt;And like the 3-in-1, the new BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 is an official, MFi-approved MagSafe device, meaning that it’s one of the few options out there for taking advantage of MagSafe’s faster 15W wireless charger. And the one-third reduction in functionality comes with a similar reduction in price: the BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 costs $99.95, compared to the $149.95 that Belkin charges for its larger counterpart. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-ir9R3QUca94OebYXITs2Was38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223074/2in1_MagSafe_poduct1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FSJGEm"&gt;The BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charger is set to release later this year in March or April, when it’ll be available from both Apple’s and Belkin’s websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bu5QuD"&gt;Along with the new wireless charger, Belkin also announced its second set of wireless earbuds, the Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds. Where the original Soundform True Wireless Earbuds were a budget option at $59.99 (with features to match), Belkin is aiming higher with the Soundform Freedom buds. The new buds feature better battery life (up to eight hours, with an additional 20 hours in the case), USB-C charging, and improved isolation of background noise (although there’s no active noise cancellation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4ImBC"&gt;Notably, the Soundform Freedom earbuds will also be one of the first third-party products to work with Apple’s Find My network (something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be offering as an option last year). That means that — similar to Apple’s own AirPods — you’ll be able to use the Find My app on iPhone and Mac devices to locate your missing headphones, using the same crowdsourced network of Apple products that the company’s own first-party devices can use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RUSrMG9eWnhkTtTj2kQEj2wfpHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223076/SoundForm_Freedom_white1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o8kwuy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbeTlx"&gt;The Soundform Freedom earbuds also offer both Qi and USB-C charging, swappable ear tips, and are rated IPX5 for sweat and splash resistance. Belkin has yet to announce pricing, but they’ll be available to purchase sometime in March or April. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler is gone for now as Amazon terminates hosting</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HH3EVI"&gt;After Parler was banned on both the Apple and Google app stores for failing to curb violent and threatening content on its platform, the social media site is now completely offline as a result of Amazon terminating Parler’s web hosting services. The official Parler website now returns a 403 error, while its app is showing networking errors and can’t load content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oij1R5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;Amazon told Parler of its decision&lt;/a&gt; late Saturday, in a letter to chief policy officer Amy Peikoff. Its Amazon Web Service (AWS) “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others,” &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws"&gt;the letter to Peikoff states&lt;/a&gt;, adding that Parler “poses a very real risk to public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idJlPKDKDtg5Y6-ZthZ4Tw5JyY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227121/File.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parler’s iOS app, which now can’t load content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ApEuFA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;Posts on Parler that encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the Wednesday attack on the Capitol that left five people dead were circulated on other platforms in the wake of the riot. An example:  “take zip ties with you, sneak up on them like ninjas and zip tie their hands and feet,” to which another poster replied: “around their neck, can’t get it off in time, they die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81ruz0"&gt;According to the AWS &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21986678%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt; customers may not use its services “for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgLpkL"&gt;Parler launched in 2018 presenting itself as a free-speech haven and an alternative to other social media sites. The site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;saw its user numbers spike&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, as Twitter and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;tightened their moderation policies&lt;/a&gt;, especially around election and coronavirus information. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;“Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt; challenging President Trump’s loss gained momentum among Parler users, as did other conspiracy theories around the election. Parler’s less-strict moderation policies were part of its appeal for many users, but the lack of content moderation is a big part of why companies suspended their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mW8lXP"&gt;When it pulled Parler from the Play Store, Google said while reasonable debate about content policy was possible, and it can be hard for apps to remove violative content immediately, “for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content.” Apple told the company that “the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XKD0V"&gt;Even with the app removed from the Play Store users could still install Parler on their Android devices by downloading it directly from Parler’s website and sideloading it. However, with its AWS services now disabled, the website and apps no longer work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZnHsY"&gt;Parler CEO John Matze — who, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjmatze%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22223335%2Fparler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; worked for AWS for three months in 2017 — wrote in a post on Parler late Saturday that he believes Amazon, Google, and Apple “worked together to try and ensure they don’t have competition,” adding “They will NOT win! We are the worlds [sic] last hope for free speech and free information.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DXYq9"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that there was no coordination with any other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSELOn"&gt;Matze said in &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/009ba435b68c46d4955e1cd7737fa27c"&gt;a separate post&lt;/a&gt; that the Parler could be offline for up to a week “as we rebuild from scratch.” Matze added, “You can expect the war on competition and free speech to continue, but don’t count us out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;Perhaps the best-known recent instance of a site being deplatformed for violent content was social network Gab. After a gunman killed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/us/pittsburgh-funerals-synagogue-shooting.html"&gt;eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting"&gt;PayPal banned Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform, when it was revealed that suspect Robert Bowers had posted anti-Semitic threats on Gab ahead of the shooting. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html"&gt;Apple rejected&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s application to appear in its App Store in 2016, and Twitter removed Gab’s access to its API. Google booted Gab app from its Play store in 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;for violating its hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;, and AWS &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/far-right-haven-gabcom-had-its-fundraising-site-shut-down"&gt;cut ties with Gab&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, for violating its policy against hateful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZjE3X"&gt;Parler has not responded to multiple requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IrVWh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th 5:22PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comment from Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
