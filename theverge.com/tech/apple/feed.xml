    <title>How to hide apps from your iPhone’s home screen using iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone games" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7MsKC4IL9WCnMxho9Z8yeE3GYPU=/0x0:3441x2294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245433/iphone-games-004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9tHJL"&gt;If you get annoyed with the number of apps that crowd your iPhone’s home screen, you probably welcomed a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21291695/apple-ios-14-updates-home-screen-redesign-features-release-date-wwdc-2020"&gt;came with iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;: the App Library, which gathers all of your apps into various categories and displays them on a separate page to the right of your home pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9dNBXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14’s App Library to organize your apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21443994/ios-14-app-library-iphone-organize-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pt9K1X"&gt;The App Library doesn’t only add some automatic organization to your iPhone’s home pages, but allows you to clean up your home screen by hiding as many apps as you want. You can keep your favorites front and center, and get the more utilitarian or less-used apps out of the way. (In fact, one way to keep a clean screen is to have all your newly-installed apps appear in your App Library only — we offer directions on how to do that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21443994/ios-14-app-library-iphone-organize-how-to"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQvLxm"&gt;If you want to organize your current apps by hiding some of them, there are several ways to do it. You can remove individual apps from the home screen, you can hide an entire screen of apps, or you can organize several apps by putting them into a folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwz9rr"&gt;Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vjeqk2"&gt;Hide a single app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press on an app and select “Remove App”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoswT8gw8DQFQzcLTVfk_jITo7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494263/IMG_6FDA0D8317B4_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on an app and select “Remove App”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Remove from Home Screen”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkFpNCzdZ1YD4yxdcVDXS2ZDXC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494261/IMG_0106.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Remove from Home Screen”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3fNxy"&gt;To hide individual apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dCkcpw"&gt;Press on your selected app until a menu appears. The menu will include a number of options, depending on the app’s features (for example, if I press on an app for Microsoft Teams, the menu will let me make a new call or start a chat). But you will always get an option (in red) to remove the app. Tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dYLK3y"&gt;You will now have the choice of deleting the app from the phone or removing it from the home screen. Select the latter. You’ll still find the app in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1tHXdP"&gt;If the app is not already in the App Library, then after you tap “Remove App,” you will instead be given the choice of either deleting the app or moving it to the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hNL7OI"&gt;Hide a page of apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long press the screen and tap the series of dots at the bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYpm-d8akSfLGxkJjGFbz-bQHe4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494282/IMG_70E40F5ECAB6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press the screen and tap the series of dots at the bottom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Uncheck the screen that you want to hide" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pldHVJRMw7Ti3jEUwGSO5odrScc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494275/IMG_8FD48CFB7F74_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncheck the screen that you want to hide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rALNn7"&gt;You can also hide an entire page of apps — and get rid of that page — at one blow if you want. And since it’s really easy to also restore that same page, it’s a great way to hide groups of apps that you only use occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v4tT06"&gt;Tap and hold on an empty part of your screen until the apps begin to jiggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XKAP6x"&gt;Tap on the dots at the bottom of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZQPXkm"&gt;You’ll now be able to see small versions of all your screens (except the App Library and Today View). Beneath each visible screen is a checkmark; uncheck any screen you want to hide and tap “Done” in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wXDkoH"&gt;To “unhide” any of the screens, follow these same directions and replace the checkmark of the screen that you want to see again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P0gvzg"&gt;Use folders to organize apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Move one app on top of another to create a gray folder" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIpIBK9-M5LOQWtd7jjCpYtCNps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494310/IMG_F1C450C97344_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move one app on top of another to create a gray folder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the folder to access the apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4GXqYO_GOuozrOkz0QtaYgPcgwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494266/IMG_0D571D5779F9_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the folder to access the apps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SK6n99"&gt;You can use folders on the home screen to gather similar apps together and save space. You won’t be completely hiding the apps — they’ll be there. But they’ll be consolidated in a single space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPxg35"&gt;It’s very simple to create a folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="626Ixd"&gt;Long-press on an app in the home screen until the icons jiggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dMfIlH"&gt;Move the app onto one of the other apps you want to group it with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ufgkAJ"&gt;You’ll now have a gray icon that contains the icons for the apps in the folder. Tap on the icon to open the folder and access the apps in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f6j7NI"&gt;iOS will assign a name to the folder depending on what apps you’ve put in it. To change the name, long-press on the folder, and select “Rename” from the pop-up menu. Then type in the new name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the folder to access the apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pq0N0qhP4_upKkheuMYVu92wt1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494270/IMG_0C514D9DDEC0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on the folder to rename or remove it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can rename it anything you like" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1skcDiJqHcDYYlA5oUP-CjpD8O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494272/IMG_B98F55477CAA_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can rename it anything you like&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Fcht3h"&gt;To remove an app from a folder, simply open the folder, long-press the app until it jiggles, and move it out of the folder and to another space on your home screen. If you remove all the apps from a folder, the folder will disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="el18TB"&gt;If you want to get rid of a folder, you can also long-press on it and select “Remove Folder.” Any apps that were in the folder can then be found in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UT4l6g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxDiB3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egtIJp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNNBa0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bwkyff"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the bad iPhone web app experience keeps coming up in Epic v. Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OIbeBrT5UyAXI-cns6znc8cu6Eo=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245096/xcloudiphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Safari just doesn’t support key features — and Safari’s the only option&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8gwpz8"&gt;Something keeps coming up at the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial as a potential alternative for getting &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on the iPhone: web apps. It’s an intriguing idea, as web apps are able to do surprisingly complex things: just look at a Chromebook or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;game streaming services on the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. But potential is far from reality, because the ability for web apps to look, feel, and perform as well as native apps on iOS is severely limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9Merj"&gt;These web apps aren’t the preferred way for consumers or developers to use or create apps on the iPhone, either. But Apple has forced companies like Microsoft and Nvidia to use web apps, instead of native ones available in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yylJtA"&gt;Though the term itself hasn’t really come up explicitly, what’s being discussed are Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs. If you’re unfamiliar, think of them as slightly more advanced web apps that you can “install” directly from your web browser onto your home screen. Google has been pushing the idea (though support for PWAs on its own platforms is a little mixed), and some companies like Microsoft and Twitter have wholeheartedly embraced PWAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUwtju"&gt;Not Apple, though. There are a variety of reasons for that — ranging from genuine concern about giving web pages too much access to device hardware to the simple fact that even Apple can’t do everything. There’s also the suspicion that Apple is deliberately dragging its feet on support for features that make PWAs better as a way to drive developers to its App Store instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRg3ygALY-Q38sy-_H2NB_ZyQDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10437351/fortniteiphonex.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt; running on an iPhone before its removal.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J19AAK"&gt;But the App Store has restrictions that aren’t tenable for some developers. That’s the whole crux of this trial for Epic, after all. On the stand, a Microsoft executive detailed the company’s struggles to get its xCloud game streaming service onto iOS. Lori Wright, VP of Xbox business development at Microsoft, revealed the company spent around four months talking to Apple to try and get xCloud launched as a native app. Apple seemed, initially, open to the idea of letting Microsoft use the same model as Netflix or Audible. But Apple changed its mind and forced Microsoft, Nvidia, and others to list cloud games as separate apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCMbLT"&gt;Submitting Xbox games one-by-one was simply a nonstarter for Microsoft, so it resorted to making a web app. In addition to the technical hurdles a web app involves, it also introduces a discoverability issue. Users simply aren’t used to installing apps from the web on their iPhones. Apple has effectively trained everybody that if they want an app, they go to the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0etUj"&gt;Wright essentially admitted that the only reason Microsoft is releasing Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) as a web app is because Apple’s terms on the App Store are too onerous. “People don’t play games through the browser on iPhone,” said Wright, but “it was our only outcome in order to reach mobile users on iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXkjIF"&gt;Even the judge in the case seemed confused by Apple’s rule, which says that services that stream movies can offer them all in a single app, but services that stream games have to separate each game for individual listing and review. “I can use Netflix with a native app and I can see lots of different movies or TV shows or whatever. Is it that you didn’t want to use a subscription model?” Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers asked at one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Uu-KLuKdNnlK8sa1T0vd91UANM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334298/microsoft_xcloud_e3_2019_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has forced Microsoft and others to head to the web for gaming streaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2sTjH"&gt;But back to those technical hurdles: they’re high, numerous, and can be blamed both on the nature of web apps and Apple’s own decisions. Safari on the iPhone only &lt;em&gt;recently&lt;/em&gt; became capable of supporting a service like Xbox Cloud Gaming via specific controller support. Until then, that sort of thing was on the list of features Apple was reticent to include in Safari. There are legitimate reasons to block things like Bluetooth access from web apps, including fingerprinting for tracking, but it was getting harder to justify and Apple needed some kind of escape valve as pressure mounted to support cloud gaming services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYerIx"&gt;Google software engineer Alex Russell recently &lt;a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/"&gt;published a very comprehensive list of all the features that Safari on iOS doesn’t support yet&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s a long list. For PWAs to truly be a viable alternative to App Store apps, there are at least a few of these features that need to be enabled. The inability to send push notifications via a web app, for example, is particularly galling as it’s already possible on Safari on macOS. An app that can’t send notifications is simply not competitive with an app that can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="gEm2RS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Grant is touching on some more of the benefits to native versus web apps; push notifications and ARKit both come up. The former is another example of Apple letting native apps reduce friction points — Epic needs to convince the judge these smaller features are meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390045337000284161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h9L1lz"&gt;As Russell notes, his “interests and biases are plain” as a Google engineer. But it doesn’t change the fact that there are many things that a PWA cannot do on the iPhone that a developer like Epic would need to support &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as a web app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EQVkX"&gt;“Native [iPhone] apps would have access to a far wider range of APIs than web apps,” explained Andrew Grant, engineering fellow at Epic Games, during the trial. “Access to things like push notifications, to Siri, to health data, and augmented reality features” are also limited to native apps, said Grant. Web apps also have to be far smaller than native apps, and are capped at about 50MB in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jl61s4"&gt;Plus, from a simple performance perspective, web apps have more overhead than native apps — and lack access to Apple APIs that can speed up games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0ncWG"&gt;In fact, this was a sticking point for a lot of the questioning of an Nvidia employee. Nvidia, like Microsoft, has been trying to get its GeForce Now cloud gaming service into the App Store, but has faced the same restrictions that Microsoft is struggling with. Nvidia director of product management Aashish Patel spent a lot of time answering questions around latency in a browser and the benefits of using native apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZgVIj"&gt;“There are less controls over the streaming, so you could argue in some ways it’s worse,” than a native app, said Patel. Developers are also locked into using the video codecs provided in Safari on iOS, whereas they could use alternatives that might be better at handling latency inside a native iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5THJwULmAlKJTxhxmhw3tU-Irjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19206401/akrales_190914_3666_0259.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All iOS browsers run the same WebKit engine underneath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KtWlda"&gt;All of this is compounded by yet another Apple policy: no third-party browser engines. You can install apps like Chrome, Firefox, Brave, DuckDuckGo, and others on the iPhone — but fundamentally they’re all just skins on top of Apple’s WebKit engine. That means that Apple’s decisions on what web features to support on Safari are final. If Apple were to find a way to be comfortable letting competing web browsers run their own browser engines, a lot of this tension would dissipate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEbgNQ"&gt;As it relates to &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, a lot of this PWA discussion isn’t germane to the fundamental arguments in the case. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as a PWA would necessarily be a streaming app instead of a native game, and that introduces an entirely different set of compromises. Which is why it’s so fascinating to see Apple’s lawyers float web apps as a potential solution — because web apps on the iPhone are famously more limited than they are on other platforms, including even Apple’s macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SC0v1r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The human-readable versus machine-readable code bit is back now — Grant is talking about how web apps don’t go through the same kind of compilation process that increases processing efficiency, yet another reason they’re not as good as native apps.&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390047726549749760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HcaeCs"&gt;Even if every single browser feature was available on mobile Safari or even if Apple allowed alternative browser engines on the iPhone, a web app will never match the performance of a native app. At the end of the day, though, all the discussion of web apps in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case highlights the limitations of Apple’s App Store policies, not of PWAs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kNJ4s1"&gt;Internal emails revealed during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; show that employees at Apple were considering giving Netflix special treatment to convince the streaming service to not abandon in-app purchases. In the run up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/28/18159373/netflix-in-app-subscriptions-iphone-ipad-ios-apple"&gt;Netflix removing its subscription offering&lt;/a&gt; to avoid Apple’s fees, a presentation circulated within Apple proposed to advertise Netflix in its retail stores, use a portion of its cut of App Store commission fees to pay for search ads, and even bundle Netflix with other Apple services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wkdav4"&gt;The emails, spotted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/05/netflix-apple-in-app-purchase/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, start with an explanation of a test Netflix wanted to run to study the impact of disabling in-app purchases on iOS. Netflix’s main concern, as Director of App Store Business Management Carson Oliver wrote, was over the “voluntary churn” of subscribers through the App Store. The exact amounts are redacted, but that seems to suggest that Netflix subscribers from the App Store cancelled the service more than subscribers who joined other ways, like through Netflix’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ch-v_51dkLOdt7otKzrq0A5XTas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494902/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_5.55.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carson Oliver’s summary of Netflix’s in-app purchase test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Eaa8G1"&gt;Since Apple takes a 30 percent cut from subscription fees as part of its App Store policy, there’s also clear financial reasons why Netflix might want to consider not using IAPs. Netflix could keep more of each monthly subscription without Apple’s cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2aLBc"&gt;In Apple’s first internal responses to Netflix’s plans, Oliver asks whether the company should consider punishing Netflix if it went forward with its test. There’s a several-month gap between the initial thread of emails and Apple’s later Netflix discussions, but the tone seems to have changed once Netflix appeared committed to A/B testing the removal of in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2GqYV"&gt;An email from July of 2018 showed Apple employees had created a presentation in favor of in-app purchases. It included reminders of the things Apple has done for Netflix and floated new deals, like offering subscriber discounts (Apple would eventually&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419634/apple-app-store-subscription-offer-codes-ios-ipados-14"&gt; launch something like that in 2020&lt;/a&gt;) and letting Netflix determine what Netflix shows and movies Apple writes about it in the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uL3cMR"&gt;Apple also highlighted all of the promotion it did for Netflix in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15741096/apple-app-store-games-redesign-announcement-wwdc-2017"&gt;editorial section of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Apple also calls out that Netflix was featured more than any partner, and content written about the streaming service’s shows had boosted its downloads by six to seven percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmhnXm"&gt;But in the same presentation, Apple considered floating even more benefits to Netflix, some of which went beyond what the company has publicly offered other developers — though in the email it was stressed that “the ‘What we could do’ section is inclusive of pie in the sky ideas for completeness, and these ideas have not yet been approved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7naa4R"&gt;The presentation included email campaigns devoted to promoting just the Netflix app, carving out a portion of subscription fees for advertising in the App Store, and the possibility of bundling Netflix with Apple’s other services, well before Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20850842/apple-tv-plus-release-date-price-shows-oprah-streaming"&gt;Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt; or its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541685/apple-one-subscription-individual-family-premier-music-tv-plus-arcade-icloud-news-fitness"&gt;Apple One bundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3J89oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10485382"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I2F2Cw"&gt;Whatever discussion between the companies did eventually happen, in-app purchases were still removed from Netflix’s app and the company doesn’t seem to have been hurt by it in the longterm — Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;reached over 200 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P20zlS"&gt;What this whole email saga is illustrative of is how Apple’s policies for developers seem to have exceptions. The details aren’t fully explained in the presentation, but Apple does bring up offering “video partner program benefits” to Netflix, which sound similar to the deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;it cut with Amazon for Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;. The emails could serve as evidence that for lucrative and powerful partners, Apple seems to be willing to make concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic v. Apple turns into Windows v. Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fT5NHsTnMdB7w9V7x756qXQasng=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69244012/twarren_200908_4177_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iOxBbv"&gt;Is an iPhone more like a PC or an Xbox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSGTMc"&gt;That question was asked — implicitly and explicitly — over and over on the third day of &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; testimony. The antitrust trial started on Monday with some heady pronunciations about &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;game and/or metaverse&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the case. Yesterday, both sides argued about whether iPhones and iPads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419894/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-2"&gt;were truly locked down&lt;/a&gt;. And today, Apple and Epic delved into one of the biggest questions of the trial: whether saying iOS violates antitrust law would make every major game console an unlawful monopoly too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOUsMk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple says if Epic wins, ‘other ecosystems will fall’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nm7vev"&gt;Apple’s attorneys issued a dire warning to Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft during its opening statement, saying that their business models were all fundamentally similar. “If Epic prevails, other ecosystems will fall too,” they warned. But today, Epic called up Microsoft’s Xbox business development head Lori Wright as a sympathetic witness. In response to a line of questioning, Wright divided computing devices into “special-purpose” and “general-purpose” devices — in a way that clearly defined iPhones as the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrnw00"&gt;The Xbox, as Wright describes it, is a special-purpose device. “You are basically building a piece of hardware to do a specific thing,” she told a judge. “The Xbox is designed to give you a gaming experience. People buy an Xbox because they want to play games.” As a result, Microsoft keeps tight control of what content users can access — it’s a “curated, custom-built hardware/software experience.” The market is also much smaller: tens or hundreds of millions sold, compared to “billions” of Windows devices. Later in the day, Epic engineering fellow Andrew Grant gave his own, similar definition of gaming consoles in general, calling a console “a single-purpose device for entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R8kA1N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It can do a bunch of things already, and it has the aperture to do a bunch more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YaV4Py"&gt;Windows computers, according to Wright, are “general-purpose” devices. “You’re buying it to do a wide variety of things, and that changes every day as new ideas are getting created,” she said. “It can do a bunch of things already, and it has the aperture to do a bunch more things.” These platforms can support unexpected, emergent applications across more aspects of people’s lives, particularly when it’s easy to &lt;em&gt;get &lt;/em&gt;an app onto them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9g0qLq"&gt;Wright made a point of discussing all the different ways that users could get apps on Windows. That includes Microsoft’s own app store, but also Steam, the Epic Games Store, and direct downloads from a website. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;recently dropped its commission on Windows apps&lt;/a&gt; to 12 percent to compete with Epic, while the Xbox still takes a 30 percent commission. Wright says there’s no plan to change that discrepancy. That’s despite the fact that under the hood, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/13/21020149/xbox-series-x-pc-specs-analysis"&gt;not a massive hardware difference&lt;/a&gt; between an Xbox and a desktop PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9c6yi"&gt;It’s hard to call the iPhone anything but a general-purpose device under Wright’s definition.  (She described a “special-purpose” Apple product as something like an iPod.) Intentionally or not, Wright also linked the distinction to one of Epic’s major talking points: profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Ps2EP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox head says the console is more like an iPod than an iPhone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hCoY1l"&gt;Epic describes profit as one of the biggest differences between iPhones and consoles. It argues console makers have to treat app makers better because they lose money on hardware, unlike Apple, so they need to plan around attracting developers to the platform. And from Microsoft’s point of view, Wright emphasized in testimony that no Xbox console has been sold at a profit, even late in a generation’s lifespan after manufacturing costs fall. So part of that curated hardware/software experience includes planning around a specific genre of app and attracting the developers who will build it, rather than simply turning it loose and seeing what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNDeo7"&gt;Microsoft later hedged in a statement saying that “profits are generated in game sales and online service subscriptions,” but it didn’t really contradict the claim — it just made clear, as Wright did, that the overall operation is profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnnCvu"&gt;Will these distinctions convince the court? It’s hard to say, and Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has asked questions that appear lightly skeptical of Epic’s hard lines between consoles and iPhones &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;Wright’s strict delineation of “general” and “specific” devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9DtAVa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You knew you were being dishonest, didn’t you?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68PLhS"&gt;Apple’s attorney didn’t spend as much time arguing over precise definitions. Apple’s strategy relied more on questioning Wright’s credibility by noting that she’d failed to produce documents that Apple requested. Later, an attorney similarly lambasted Grant for working on the hotfix that secretly introduced a new payment system into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, insisting that “you knew you were being dishonest, didn’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAzXo0"&gt;But Apple &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; push Wright to lay out in detail just &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;much more locked-down Xbox is than Windows, asking whether it did things like support rival game stores or streaming services. (This questioning was muddled by the fact that Microsoft refers to both its consoles &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;general gaming division as “Xbox,” so you can have an “Xbox store” on PC — a fact that led to some confusion during cross-examination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUAFA4"&gt;Why is this useful to Apple? Well, Epic began the trial by saying that iOS should work more like macOS. Both operating systems have a reputation for relative security and seamlessness, but only the latter allows installing software from outside the App Store. Epic’s opening statement questioned why Apple needed to lock down the iPhone when it had already created a perfectly workable but more open system. But with Wright and Microsoft, Apple has a perfect comparison point: a major computing company that offers two very different versions of a big black box.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s feud with Apple over xCloud on iOS got a rival kicked from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpd1t7o7MzXlDkz8zfhVU81tQI0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241844/acastro_210429_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="59ak2k"&gt;In 2020, Microsoft was battling to bring xCloud or Xbox Game Streaming to the iPhone and iPad, and the conversations had an unlikely victim: Shadow — a third-party cloud gaming app that lets you stream PC games to an iPhone or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cZfC5"&gt;Emails between Microsoft and Apple, revealed in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial today, show how the Xbox maker was trying to get xCloud on iOS. Microsoft was trying to figure out how Shadow, Netflix, and other similar “interactive” apps were able to exist in the App Store while Apple was refusing to approve xCloud. Microsoft put forward Shadow as an example of such a service, only to see it suddenly removed from the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSJBCU"&gt;“We were showing two examples where a game or an application was able to exist, and we didn’t understand why we couldn’t,” explained Lori Wright, Microsoft’s head of business development for Xbox, during the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial today. “I believe they [Apple] ended up pulling Shadow out of the App Store based off this email we sent until they submitted changes. That was not our intention of course, it was a byproduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwP09JyRmiWPgyGUd-04tZfidVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22493777/0_yXBrpxirKTDnT7a8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Shadow&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow on iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="REs2dG"&gt;While Shadow’s removal wasn’t permanent, Apple has temporarily removed the app from the App Store twice in the past year. Shadow was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowPC/comments/f9wtjl/shadow_ios_app_removed_from_the_app_store/"&gt;first removed in February&lt;/a&gt; last year, with Apple reportedly citing a “failure to act in accordance with a specific part of the Apple App Store Guidelines.” Apple once again &lt;a href="https://forum.shadow.tech/news-announcements-42/shadow-removed-from-apple-app-store-what-you-should-know-2314"&gt;removed Shadow from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; in February, and the app returned a week later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDi8OE"&gt;Shadow revealed that the app was removed the second time “due to a misunderstanding” around the nature of the app. “Unlike game streaming services, Shadow provides a full Windows 10 PC, rather than a library of games,” explained Luc Hancock, a community manager for Shadow. “This unique approach allows Shadow to comply with the App Store guidelines, so that you can access your Shadow PC on any iOS device to run your favorite games and software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vb5FdM"&gt;Valve struggled for more than a year to launch its Steam Link game streaming service on iOS. Apple rejected the app, likely because it allowed an iOS user to access another app store, Steam, within Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17430532/apple-app-store-rules-valve-steam-link-game-streaming"&gt;Apple revised its rules&lt;/a&gt; after rejecting Steam Link, and the app was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18627110/steam-link-app-ios-apple-tv-released"&gt;finally approved two years ago in May 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;xCloud on iOS via the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOUoIU"&gt;Apple continued to make it difficult for services like xCloud and Stadia to run the way Microsoft and Google wanted to on iOS devices after those conversations, only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;slowly making App Store policy carve-outs&lt;/a&gt; that would let the services operate under severe restrictions. Apple now insists that developers individually submit games as separate apps using their streaming tech, only then bundling them together as a “catalog”-style app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoZYSl"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;wasn’t impressed with Apple’s approach&lt;/a&gt;, calling it a “bad experience for customers.” This public spat has now boiled over into the courtroom battle between Epic Games and Apple, with lawyers on Epic’s side questioning Microsoft and Nvidia representatives about their struggles to bring cloud gaming apps to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRnKrD"&gt;Both Microsoft and Nvidia have had to give in to Apple’s restrictions and launch their cloud gaming services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391561/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features"&gt;through the Safari web browser&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new 11-inch iPad Pro is already $50 off at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XhdJUoJIvAT4grCWyb1qUU4JkoU=/0x38:980x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241072/ipad_pro_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="601EPa"&gt;The new 11-inch iPad Pro with the M1 processor costs $799 to preorder at most retailers, but not at Walmart. You can reserve an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1039828/9383?sharedid=VergeApple11InchPro050521&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver%2F307298322&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch model with 128GB of storage for $749&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll arrive at your door on or before June 1st. The step-up configuration with 256GB of storage is $50 off, too, costing $849 to preorder. We’ve seen similar preorder deals on the new iPad Pro from &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fipad-pro-11-inch-1%3Fvariant%3D39316139212834#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a site called Expercom&lt;/a&gt;, but it currently offers a vague “3-6 week” estimate for shipping your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjcFdP"&gt;Granted, it’ll still be another handful of weeks before a purchase from Walmart ships, but at least there’s some reassurance there that it’ll arrive by early June at the latest. At the time of publishing, Walmart says that orders will ship on Monday, May 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dcxYVO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9efM2W"&gt;With this new generation of iPad Pro, Apple uses the same M1 processor that’s found in the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and new iMac. The company’s tablet and computing lineups are still distinct in the software they use (iPadOS versus macOS), but they’re getting more similar with every new iteration. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin thinks Apple ought to just rip off the bandage&lt;/a&gt; and put macOS on the iPad since its hardware is similar in many ways to a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="j6ndHY"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ethics-statement"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;ethics statement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGm34V"&gt;Finding a good gift for Father’s Day can be really difficult — especially with all those “traditional” dad gifts out there that are just, well, boring. So this year, we’ve looked around for some special, interesting gifts for dad in a wide range of types and prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iwogd"&gt;We’ve got a bunch of stuff for the do-it-yourselfer: a Leatherman multitool, the ultimate gardening tool, and a whiskey- and rum-making kit. For the tech enthusiast, we’ve got a VR device, a gaming mouse, and a mini electric screwdriver set. And for the lovers of quirk, we offer a New York City brunch, a desk toy that can form a dodecahedron, and a subscription for two vinyl records a month, among a load of other great gift ideas. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NZJH6Z"&gt;Google’s Chromecast has always been a low-cost method for streaming your favorite apps on your TV. Its new interface makes it easy to find and subscribe to all of your favorite programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BkLDmx"&gt;The Apple TV 4K is a great TV box for sharing photos, watching videos, and playing music for a party. Sure, it’s a bit of an expensive gift, but this is a shiny new version, and it is on its way. And even better, it has a new remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CZx75b"&gt;The best wireless earbuds to get if dad operates in the Apple ecosystem: great sound, easy to use, and fantastic to make calls with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pFyrQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeFather%27sDayGiftGuide042921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMWP22AM%2FA%2Fairpods-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$249 at APPLE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="64vDXB"&gt;A smartwatch is a great gift. If dad is an Apple person, the Apple Watch SE will help him track his exercise, keep in touch, listen to tunes — and even tell the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEgjgE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeFather%27sDayGiftGuide042921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-watch-se%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$279 at APPLE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5bs9Zx"&gt;If dad’s an Android user, the Ticwatch Pro 3 is a good-looking watch that should take care of everything he needs in a smartwatch. According to our reviewer, it takes Wear OS as far as it can go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FDxFn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TicWatch-Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Monitoring-Waterproof/dp/B08BRFWGMC?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergefathersday2021-20&amp;amp;linkId=b6a4b338bf291ac290c9a04da255b0ed&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 at AMAZON&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="eSLOjk"&gt;It’s fun to game with others, but sometimes it’s even better to slip off into your own little virtual world. The Oculus Quest 2 is a smart purchase if dad wants to explore virtual environments or get sweaty moving to the music in &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic says there’s an App Store payment lockout — but Apple just sees friction</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6nGSrGgSPIrQ3333fxQU8fhUMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237973/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yWVbvi"&gt;One of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;trial’s big keywords is “cross-wallet play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPNiWY"&gt;In Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, “cross-wallet” means you can buy in-game currency (known as V-Bucks) with real money on one device, then spend it on a different device. The latter platform doesn’t get a cut of your initial, non-virtual financial transaction, which is why Nintendo and Sony don’t support cross-wallet access on the Switch and PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vd1uJt"&gt;Apple &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;support cross-wallet play before banning &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; last year — and on the trial’s second day, that fact became a serious pitfall for Epic. Apple continued a long cross-examination of Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, whose hours of testimony included a digression on whether &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;counts as a true metaverse&lt;/a&gt; or simply a big free-to-play game that has concerts. (Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers suggested, and Sweeney concurred, that “the most readily acceptable analogy” might be Steven Spielberg’s &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SIRLNJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is the web a viable alternative or a clunky workaround?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7NLGqN"&gt;Sweeney was followed by two witnesses from outside Epic: the founder of an iOS yoga app, followed by the product manager for Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. All argued that Apple’s tightly managed App Store forced customers to use clunky workarounds. Meanwhile, Apple argued that the workarounds weren’t necessarily worse — just different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93znsi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was kicked off the App Store for adding its own V-Bucks purchasing system right inside the app, violating Apple’s restrictions on in-app payment processing. But as Apple’s lawyers pointed out today, Epic had another option for selling V-Bucks on iOS. The company just needed to sell them directly through its website, which users could visit through the iPhone or iPad Safari browser without Apple getting any kind of commission. When they booted up &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on iOS, their V-Bucks would be waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="werkN6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Isn’t that a responsible way to deal with a young client base?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A1m6wo"&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found this argument compelling enough to follow up on. Why couldn’t iPhone users buy V-Bucks through Safari, she asked, before &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s &lt;/em&gt;ban in August? Epic CEO Tim Sweeney admitted that Epic could have added the feature — but “it wasn’t a very attractive option for our customers,” Sweeney told her. If somebody wants to buy V-Bucks, he said, there’s a good chance they’re already looking at an item in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. “To set &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; aside and pull out some device, browse to a website, log in, make a transaction there, it’s extremely inconvenient.” In short, “there’s a huge amount of payment processing and customer friction associated with selling a user of an app an item outside of that app.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXAC14"&gt;But after asking how old most &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players were, Rogers suggested that a little friction might be a good thing. “Why is it so inconvenient that someone can’t make what I would call, as a parent, an impulse purchase?” she asked. “Isn’t that a responsible way to deal with a young client base?” If people can buy V-Bucks and then switch platforms, “what you’re really asking for is the ability to have impulse purchases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtZUqF"&gt;Sweeney said &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; had parental controls, but he didn’t dispute Rogers’ basic point. “Yes. Customer convenience is a huge factor in this. People are much more likely to make a purchase if it’s easy to make a purchase,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RUBNej"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Customer convenience is a huge factor in this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jeBjpA"&gt;A similar question arose with a later witness. Benjamin Simon is the CEO of a company called Yoga Buddhi, which runs an iOS app called Down Dog. (Sadly, nobody in court thought to&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/23/7443635/updog-finally-launches"&gt; make an Updog joke&lt;/a&gt;.) Yoga Buddhi offers a hefty discount for signing up outside the iOS app. And unlike Epic, it’s fine sending people to a website. Simon claims, however, that Apple makes finding that website as hard as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pLxW9"&gt;Simon says that Apple rejected several versions of Down Dog that reference getting a discount elsewhere. Right now, about half the iOS user base apparently pays a premium to sign up through the App Store. For comparison, only 10 percent of Android users pay a similar premium through the Play Store, because Google doesn’t have the same restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSE4Av"&gt;Simon acknowledged that Yoga Buddhi can reach customers via other methods like email and help them switch to the discounted version. The problem, again, is friction. “We’re restricted in our ability to communicate with our customers from within our product,” he complained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltC0J0"&gt;From Apple’s perspective, both executives are making a big deal out of a small inconvenience. Customers might have to work a little harder to save money, but that doesn’t equate to a monopolistic lockdown. And while Sweeney describes &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;as a lofty metaverse, Rogers put it in the very different context of “freemium” gaming — an industry whose powerful, frictionless gaming loops are regularly criticized as addictive and predatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZDuFe"&gt;Arguably, though, that very criticism bolsters Epic’s claims. In the past several years, regulators and researchers have shown increasing concern over subtle design choices in apps — like infinite scrolling,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360639/robinhood-confetti-ipo-removed-app-stock-market"&gt; confetti animation&lt;/a&gt;, and tweaks to the sorting algorithms on social networks. There’s a broad consensus that small nudges can substantially increase how much people invest in digital platforms. But Epic might have to work harder to convince a court this investment isn’t a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Updating an Apple Watch Series 3 is a nightmare in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="support watchOS 7" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m23lGrFdlO4Tgo_Rm2Woyf6BRAs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237283/akrales_171113_2119_0045.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Novi9Y"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 3 was first released in September 2017, bringing fitness improvements and a faster processor. Nearly four years later, in 2021, Apple is still selling the Series 3 as its entry-level Apple Watch model starting at $199, an $80 savings compared to the more recent Apple Watch SE. Only, as I’ve recently learned, “still selling” and “supporting in a reasonable manner” are two very different things, and updating an Apple Watch Series 3 in 2021 is a nightmare of infuriating technological hoops to jump through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoLbgp"&gt;Normally, updating an Apple Watch is an annoyingly long but straightforward process: you charge your Watch up to 50 percent, plug it in, and wait for the slow process of the update transferring and installing to your smartwatch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBMQL9"&gt;But the non-cellular Apple Watch Series 3 has a tiny 8GB of internal storage, a fair chunk of which is taken up by the operating system and other critical software. So installing a major update — like the recently released watchOS 7.4 — goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="N0ZP6p"&gt;Unpair and wipe your Apple Watch to factory settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="onsN8l"&gt;Set up the Apple Watch again and restore from backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CuJz8D"&gt;Realize you weren’t supposed to restore from your backup yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HHVXuu"&gt;Watch an episode or two of &lt;em&gt;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&lt;/em&gt; while you wait for the backup to finish restoring &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JC5thp"&gt;Start from step one again — but as a brand-new Apple Watch, without restoring from an existing backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8em0yG"&gt;Update completely fresh Apple Watch, which now has enough free memory to update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y27oSu"&gt;Consider how much you actually want to use this face unlocking feature everyone keeps hyping up in the first place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vTOHQq"&gt;Unpair and wipe the Apple Watch a third time &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zfIcLk"&gt;Restore from your backup and finally use normally &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="VN9e8r"&gt;And the issue seems to apply whether you’ve installed a pile of apps or not. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211283"&gt;Apple’s support website doesn’t even recommend&lt;/a&gt; that Series 3 owners bother trying to clear up space — it just advocates that they go straight to the aforementioned reset cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbnkFB3jL9oVCroM-h2Unt8uiVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491512/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_2.22.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2pBJTT"&gt;It’s clear that the current process is untenable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnU84A"&gt;I’m an editor at a technology news site and willing to put in the comical amount of time and energy to manage this, frustrating as it might be. But if you’re a more casual user — the same one who is likely to own an older, outdated Watch in the first place — why on earth would you bother with the worst update mechanism since GE’s instructions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18692583/c-by-ge-reset-insanity-internet-of-shit"&gt;for resetting a smart bulb&lt;/a&gt;? And being able to update your hardware’s software is important: the just-released watchOS 7.4.1, for example, patches a critical security flaw. But with it being so difficult to install, there’s a good chance that plenty of Series 3 owners won’t bother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhAbfO"&gt;I know that Apple loves to claim support for as many older hardware generations as it can with each new update. It’s one of the biggest appeals of Apple products, compared to the lackluster pace of updates on competing Android phones (like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419205/samsung-galaxy-s8-security-update-schedule"&gt;just-deprecated Galaxy S8&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAhjoU"&gt;But the miserable update process for the Series 3 is a strong argument that Apple is being a little too generous with what it considers “current” hardware. Keeping the Series 3 around this long was always a money grab, a way for Apple to clear out old inventory and take advantage of mature manufacturing processes that have long since broken even in order to appeal to users who &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; can’t afford the extra $80 for the markedly better Apple Watch SE. It’s a similar trend to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-tv%2Fapple-tv-hd%2F32gb&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419569%2Fapple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inexplicably still-on-sale Apple TV HD&lt;/a&gt;, which is almost six years old and costs just $30 less than the brand-new 4K model. (Much like the Series 3, don’t buy a new Apple TV HD in 2021 either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m3cqV"&gt;But hopefully, with the announcement of watchOS 8 almost assuredly around the corner at WWDC this June, the company takes into account the basic functionality of its hardware when considering what it does and doesn’t offer support for. Because if Apple is going to insist on selling a product this old in the future, it’s going to need to be a lot more mindful of just how it actually handles its software support. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Sweeney emailed Tim Cook personally to call for open app sales after WWDC in 2015</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook (Verge, 640)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbe3UHKqsId6fTW2JmCFhhPSQg4=/0x0:716x477/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69236646/tim-cook_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jdmmXn"&gt;Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney was asking Apple to open its phones to other app stores as early as 2015, according to new emails made public as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the companies’ antitrust trial&lt;/a&gt;. Under the subject line “iOS as an open platform,” Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20697668-tim-sweeney-tim-cook-email-open-ios"&gt;emailed Apple CEO Tim Cook directly&lt;/a&gt; to make the case for allowing other app stores to distribute software on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biLoWU"&gt;“The App Store has done much good for the industry,” Sweeney wrote to Cook, “but it doesn’t seem tenable for Apple to be the sole arbiter of expression and commerce over an app platform approaching a billion users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtfE9M"&gt;In particular, Sweeney asked to “separate iOS App Store curation from compliance review and app distribution,” essentially suggesting that Apple could maintain its security features across the platform without routing all downloads through the central App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nZVAkS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it doesn’t seem tenable for Apple to be the sole arbiter of expression and commerce over an app platform approaching a billion users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="roU80u"&gt;It’s a powerful distinction for the ongoing trial, in which Apple is arguing that App Store exclusivity is necessary to maintain the existing security and privacy features on iOS. These are part of the compliance process referenced by Sweeney in the email, and other ecosystems have been successful in implementing them across multiple app stores. Most recently, Google introduced a similar system on Android &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect"&gt;under the name Play Protect&lt;/a&gt;, guarding against malicious downloads even from side-loaded software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oVmTZ"&gt;Cook responded by forwarding the message to Phil Schiller with a question: “Is this the guy that was at one of our rehearsals?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2UxLp"&gt;It’s likely that he was: a few weeks earlier, Epic Games had made &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChIuImrOsaY"&gt;an appearance at Apple’s WWDC event&lt;/a&gt;, touting the company’s work using Apple’s Metal API, although Sweeney did not appear onstage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vCXtBs"&gt;Other emails show Sweeney continuing to push Apple behind the scenes, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20697673-px-2421"&gt;asking Epic co-founder Mark Rein&lt;/a&gt; to push for a meeting with Greg Joswiak in January 2018. “If the App Store [were] merely the premier way for consumers to install software and not the sole way, then Apple could curate higher quality software overall, without acting as a censor on free expression,” Sweeney argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcNNXA"&gt;Rein was ultimately able to arrange a hearing for the idea through Apple’s Tim Kirby and expressed enthusiasm. “He was definitely receptive to the idea,” Rein wrote, “which doesn’t mean it will go anywhere, but does mean he’ll line up people who will listen and not shoot it down like Phil Schiller would.... so maybe there’s a smallest little crack on the very outer surface of the many feet of ice covering the frozen lake that is the Apple store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3xn7J"&gt;Six years later, the ice has yet to thaw.&lt;/p&gt;
