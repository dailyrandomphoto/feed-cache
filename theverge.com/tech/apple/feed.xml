    <title>Apple reportedly developing magnetic battery pack for iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AtM7sJ_nVFOMcQTgL86zzKsEotU=/0x0:1152x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841695/magsafe_main_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 was announced alongside a range of MagSafe accessories last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GkN3R9"&gt;Apple is reportedly developing a new iPhone charging accessory in the form of a battery pack that magnetically attaches to the rear of the device using MagSafe, &lt;a href="https://chorus.voxmedia.com/compose/ac4534a6-8226-4c02-89c8-89b7e0d3d439"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Although some prototypes have a rubber exterior, the battery pack isn’t thought to act as a protective case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18206642/apple-smart-battery-case-iphone-xs-xr-max-reveiw-test-specs-price-features"&gt;like previous iPhone battery accessories&lt;/a&gt; from Apple. Alongside details of the new battery case, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also notes that the iPhone lineup is unlikely to receive support for reverse wireless charging anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJdoq5"&gt;The battery pack accessory is thought to have been in development for at least a year, but it’s reportedly faced development issues relating to the iPhone’s software thinking that the pack is overheating. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Apple is cautious about announcing charging accessories, after it was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;cancel its AirPower charging mat in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, a year and a half after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16278310/apple-iphone-8-wireless-charging"&gt;it was first announced&lt;/a&gt;. Development problems could mean that the new battery pack accessory is delayed or even scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ro5Cht"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s reportedly faced development issues&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PfV6fm"&gt;The charging pack would be the latest in Apple’s lineup of iPhone 12 MagSafe accessories, which attach onto the back of the phone with the assistance of an embedded circle of magnets. Previous accessories have included wall chargers, as well as magnetically attaching wallets. MagSafe is said to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;returning to Apple’s laptops&lt;/a&gt; as well, only with a connector reminiscent of the old pill-shaped design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joluiK"&gt;Rumors of the new battery pack first emerged after a reference to it was found in code in the iOS 14.5 beta, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/everything-new-ios-14-5-beta-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that the reference has subsequently been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcHjrW"&gt;As well as the new battery pack, Apple is reportedly interested in allowing its devices to charge one another. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that it had planned for its 2019 iPhone lineup to be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/23/18278557/apple-iphone-11-wireless-charging-other-devices-airpods-watch-rumor"&gt;wirelessly charge AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, but the plans were later scrapped. The functionality is “unlikely in the near future,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrqO9g"&gt;Other accessory manufacturers are already attempting to offer similar functionality to the rumored MagSafe battery pack. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/27/21536837/mophie-juice-pack-connect-wireless-battery-qi-charging"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on one such pack late last year, which was being sold on Alibaba and Aliexpress under a variety of names.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly negotiating to build iPads in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fyWgILRvLhswLWuBqeY1XO8bJ1k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68840821/vpavic_190829_3709_1164.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1HWnMS"&gt;Apple is said to be lobbying the Indian government in a move that could see the company manufacture iPads in the country for the first time. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-india-idCAKBN2AI0TL"&gt;Reuters reports&lt;/a&gt; that the government is planning to launch an incentive scheme designed to boost India’s computer exports, and Apple wants in — but is angling for a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6dJlO"&gt;The initiative will have a budget of up to Rs. 70 billion ($964 million) over five years, according to Reuters, but Apple is reportedly asking for that to be almost tripled to Rs. 200 billion. The reason is said to be partly that India’s supply chain doesn’t yet have the scale to meet Apple’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jzy8"&gt;Apple already makes iPhones in India, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17506068/apple-iphone-6s-india-tariffs"&gt;started in 2018&lt;/a&gt; to avoid new import tariffs imposed by the Indian government as part of a “Make in India” initiative. The company has also been seeking to diversify its manufacturing out of China; last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252434/apple-manufacturing-china-vietnam-ipad-india-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that some iPad production would shift to Vietnam this year, which would be the first time major iPad manufacturing happened anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFrJOT"&gt;Two people that spoke to Reuters said it was likely that iPads would be assembled in India by one of its current contractors “as early as this year.” Apple’s partners in India currently include Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV app now available on the latest Google Chromecast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zVOSMThHUPqFqBdRZwA3O_niMzg=/0x0:1569x1046/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68837077/Blog_header.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rB2lJ"&gt;The Apple TV app is now available for Google’s 2020 Chromecast. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178364/google-chromecast-apple-tv-plus-app-2021-announcement"&gt;announced in December&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s streaming app, which offers access to its Apple TV Plus originals, would be coming to the awkwardly named Chromecast with Google TV. Starting today, owners of the excellent $50 device can download Apple TV and start using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlwBpL"&gt;Apple TV originals like &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt; will appear in Google TV’s recommendations and search results. Of note, you’ll also be able to add Apple’s original shows and movies to Google TV’s universal Watchlist. Some bigger streaming services like Netflix have decided against participating in Watchlist in the months since the Chromecast’s release, as they seemingly prefer to keep that sort of functionality inside the app itself. As &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/25/google-tv-netflix-dropped/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in November, the Google TV mobile app doesn’t even include Netflix recommendations anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wU5zHi"&gt;Apple TV is also getting Google Assistant integration on Chromecast; you can start watching any of Apple’s originals with a voice command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQPyiZ"&gt;In addition to being home to Apple’s original programming, the Apple TV app offers easy streaming of your movie / TV show rentals and purchases from Apple. And as on other platforms, any Apple TV Channel add-on subscriptions you might have — CBS All Access, Showtime, etc. — will be available in the app on Chromecast with Google TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO61r8"&gt;Jonathan Zepp, Google’s director of media and entertainment, says that “in addition to Chromecast with Google TV, the Apple TV app will also be available on Google TVs from Sony and TCL.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 12 series is already driving 5G adoption in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vAkeyL_t_xPNV7uq5rUlpNvT38=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832611/cgartenberg_201105_4276_006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $1,099 iPhone 12 Pro Max is currently the top 5G phone in the US, according to research firm M Science.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ArLmxh"&gt;Some new data &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/one-phone-dominates-us-5g-sales-can-you-guess-what-it-is"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the iPhone 12 Pro Max, 12 Pro, and 12 are already the three top-selling 5G phones in the US. That the phones are just four months old speaks to the continued popularity of the iPhone in the US and just how big of a role it will play in driving 5G adoption in this country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04QSPM"&gt;These reports come from research firm M Science’s sales data and information gathered from Ookla Speedtest users. M Science tracks cumulative sales of 5G phones in the US. This data set includes sales as of the week of January 23rd and notably does not include Galaxy S21-series phones, which hadn’t started shipping at that point. These are third-party reports, so they should be taken with a grain of salt, but M Science’s findings line up with previous reports of &lt;a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/iphone-12-series-launch-review/"&gt;strong 12 Pro Max sales&lt;/a&gt; out of the gate and &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/iphone-12-mini-sales-reportedly-well-below-expectations/"&gt;less-good 12 mini sales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LSPm5E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is responsible for a bit less than half of all mobile phone shipments in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfB53P"&gt;Apple, as it is wont to do, took its time adding 5G to its phones. Samsung started in 2019 with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231384/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-verizon-announcement-specs"&gt;Galaxy S10 5G&lt;/a&gt; and added 5G &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21128230/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-ultra-price-camera-5g-features-video-hands-on"&gt;across its S20 series&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. Outside of those two manufacturers, 5G has trickled down from a once-premium feature into the budget phone class more recently. Despite this growing range of options, adoption has been slow. Since Apple is responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share"&gt;a bit less than half of all mobile phone shipments&lt;/a&gt; in the US, it makes sense that a 5G iPhone would give adoption rates a nudge. So far, that seems to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x21j74"&gt;In the US, 5G’s slow start certainly hasn’t been helped by a less-than-stellar product. While each major carrier offers nationwide 5G coverage, performance is often about the same as 4G — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;sometimes even worse&lt;/a&gt;. That’ll change when more spectrum becomes available to the carriers later this year and into next, but not before a lot of new iPhone 12 owners (unfortunately?) experience 5G for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gyhAdb"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac mini with the M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; is on sale at select retailers.

&lt;p id="jpMcJi"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation Plus online subscription service includes many perks outside of the ability to play games online with friends. An active PS Plus membership also nets you access to exclusive discounts from the PS Store, along with free games that rotate out on a monthly cadence. &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba&lt;/a&gt; is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers based in the United States the opportunity to stock up on service by purchasing &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two one-year subscriptions for only $54&lt;/a&gt; when you enter code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE27AYEAR&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout, while supplies last.

&lt;p id="jbMPlR"&gt;If you are an early adopter of either the PS5 or the Xbox Series X and you’re looking to find a TV that can take full advantage of the next-gen hardware, LG’s CX OLED TVs are a good option.

  &lt;p id="L19jlq"&gt;Nomad has updated its lineup of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fcollections%2Fiphone-12-cases&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287731%2Fnomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rugged leather iPhone cases&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, and 12 mini with the much-anticipated addition of support for Apple’s MagSafe charging standard. &lt;/p&gt;

In fact, they’re actually $10 more than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-case-horween-leather-rustic-brown-iphone-12-pro-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287731%2Fnomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nomad’s original line&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-folio-horween-leather-rustic-brown-iphone-12-pro-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287731%2Fnomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;of iPhone 12 cases&lt;/a&gt;, which look virtually identical from the outside. (The new MagSafe cases will replace the older models once stock runs out, the company says.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8zSAyq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KxylumIPCk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wpQ4I"&gt;But the Nomad cases are more solidly put together than Apple’s own offerings. As the “rugged” in the name suggests, the Nomad models feature a plastic shell and rubber frame that promises to protect the phone against drops from up to 10 feet. That protection does come at a cost, though: only the back of the case is actually covered with leather (which is the same Horween leather that Nomad uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176171/nomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on"&gt;on its other products&lt;/a&gt;). In 2017, my colleague Dan Seifert said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16744278/apple-iphone-x-leather-case"&gt;iPhone X version of the case&lt;/a&gt; “feels more like a leather skin on top of a rubber case than a full leather experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uzFO6"&gt;The standard Rugged Leather case is available in three colors: black, brown, and natural leather, while the Rugged Folio case comes in black and brown. Both models are available to order today from Nomad’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s Pro Plus iPad keyboard gets much better trackpad support with new firmware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gz2ot_feK6QKxMzoBK4LczmOdR4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830902/DSC00760.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aeq4bm"&gt;Brydge has announced a new firmware update for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;Pro Plus iPad keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that promises to hugely improve the trackpad experience. The update brings “native” multitouch to the trackpads, meaning you can use the same kind of multi-finger gestures on a Brydge device as Apple’s own Magic Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMzPc0"&gt;The Brydge Pro Plus was the victim of unfortunate timing. It was originally announced as a power-user product designed to support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18743993/ipad-mouse-ipad-os-how-to"&gt;experimental cursor feature&lt;/a&gt;, but then Apple turned that into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/18/21184933/ipados-13-4-mouse-trackpad-support-ipad-apple-computer-date"&gt;consumer-level functionality&lt;/a&gt; with iOS 13.4 and released its own keyboard/trackpad accessory, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;expensive but excellent Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. At launch, the Pro Plus’ trackpad was usable for basic tasks, but it didn’t have full gesture support and couldn’t compete with the smoothness of Apple’s own hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iOhmE1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brydge Pro Plus review: an almost awesome iPad laptop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vLCQyi"&gt;I’ve spent a couple of days with a beta version of Brydge’s new firmware, using the company’s keyboard designed for the 11-inch iPad, and the news is good so far. While the trackpad on this model is quite small, and its levered mechanism means there isn’t a lot of space for clicking, the cursor movement is far smoother and gestures work well. You can use three fingers to swipe between apps, for example, or swipe up to bring you to the multitasking interface. Simple two-finger scrolling is also much improved, working with consistent momentum as you’d expect across various apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQoBB1"&gt;I’ll have to test the Pro Plus’ new firmware further before giving a final verdict, but my first impressions are positive. The Pro Plus looks like it’ll soon be a much more viable product than it was upon its original launch, particularly since Brydge is putting it on sale today; the 12.9-inch model is getting a $60 reduction to $169.99, while the 11-inch version is available for $40 off at $159.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r-STwegfKI0oJcIBOP32bqwoXhY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309579/BRY8012___Main.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n1X3Uq"&gt;Brydge is also announcing a new trackpad-equipped iPad keyboard, the first product to come out of a collaboration with OtterBox that was &lt;a href="http://news.brydge.com/111070-brydge-announces-go-to-market-collaboration-with-otter-products"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt;. The 10.2 Max Plus is designed for the seventh- and eighth generation iPads with 10.2-inch displays, and includes a detachable case that Brydge says offers 4-foot drop protection. It’s set to ship in late March and will be &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-10-2-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287000%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to preorder today&lt;/a&gt; for $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPVa8E"&gt;If you already have a Pro Plus keyboard, meanwhile, Brydge is opening signups for a public beta of the new firmware. You can register &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fpages%2Fmulti-touch-beta&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287000%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; the page notes that the firmware will require an iPad running Apple’s iPadOS 14.5 public beta. The program will begin on March 3rd, but 500 users will get earlier access on February 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games brings Apple fight to the EU with new antitrust complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FfoJ2jwG5QC9WTDp8EHNXq33q8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829189/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="owZZU4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games has made a formal antitrust complaint about Apple to the European Commission, the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-eu-antitrust-complaint-against-apple"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Epic alleges that Apple’s “carefully designed anti-competitive restrictions” have “completely eliminated competition in app distribution and payment processes.” It says this leads to consumers playing higher prices, and gives Apple too much control over developers on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geMeM2"&gt;The complaint is the latest legal action taken by Epic in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know/archives"&gt;ongoing dispute with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The developer has criticized Apple’s control over software distribution with the App Store, as well as its policies around payments, which often result in Apple taking a 30 percent cut of in-app purchases. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has called this 30 percent cut a “tax,” and Epic claims Apple’s policies give its own services an unfair advantage over other iOS developers. In November, Apple said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;reduce its App Store commission rate to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for any developer that earns less than $1 million in annual revenue, in an apparent response to pressure from developers and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2iCJC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic wants “timely and effective remedies” from the EU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zuHcZa"&gt;In its announcement, Epic Games said it’s not seeking damages from Apple in the EU. Instead, it says it wants “timely and effective remedies” to address what it claims are Apple’s anti-competitive practices. “We just want to see prohibition on these platform companies using their control over the hardware to exert control over secondary markets and force them to compete on equal terms with every competitor,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e1259614-d954-400f-9265-f39a36c8c0c6"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when asked what these remedies should include. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwDVCL"&gt;Epic’s dispute with Apple erupted last summer when the developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;attempted to circumvent&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Apple responded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removing the popular game from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;, only for Epic Games to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;file a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in response. Epic has subsequently &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/freefortnite-australia-press-release"&gt;launched legal proceedings in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/epic-widens-fortnite-access-dispute-with-apple-google-in-u-k?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;complained to the UK’s antitrust tribunal&lt;/a&gt; about Apple’s actions. Epic Games and Apple are due to meet in court in May, according to the &lt;em&gt;FT. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qICjs"&gt;As well as challenging Apple, Epic also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;sued Google&lt;/a&gt; after it removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from Android’s Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ruv2OL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euiSHuaw6Q4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qg8auo"&gt;Responding to Epic’s latest filing, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/epic-games-attacks-apple-in-complaint-to-eu-antitrust-watchdog?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Epic had intentionally violated its App Store policies, and that these “apply equally to every developer and protect customers.” It said Epic’s actions “made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to the European Commission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8sosu"&gt;Epic’s new complaint follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;EU’s announcement last year&lt;/a&gt; that it has opened a formal antitrust investigation against Apple over its App Store and Apple Pay practices. The EU is concerned that Apple’s policies stifle and distort competition in cases where Apple’s own services compete with other developers on its App Store. Messaging app Telegram &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/88589fc5-8410-4274-859c-d27b3d83fe20"&gt;has also complained to the EU&lt;/a&gt; about Apple’s policies, demanding that it allow users to download software outside of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iOS 14.5 emoji promote inclusivity, vaccines, and the AirPods Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xm9RmEwgnIpNePWUfHMq9IuWZjo=/0x0:809x539/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68827365/Newios14.5emoji.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaA86G"&gt;As part of iOS 14.5, Apple is adding new emoji from the Unicode Consortium’s Emoji 13.1 release, including skin tone options for some popular emoji and several new smiley faces and hearts. The company is also making some changes to other emoji that are already available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90fJIf"&gt;The new changes to skin tone and gender presentation are probably the most important to note. Popular emoji like “Couples Kissing” and “Couples with Heart” now have many more skin tone variations for all options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xwUHU4LciSJ8wqetLXp50w4hYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307939/couples_with_skin_tones_ios_14_5_emojipedia.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Emojipedia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skin tone variations for the “Couples with Heart” emoji in iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IR7hYh"&gt;In addition to more skin tones, the bearded emoji has also been adjusted to allow for not just the neutral “Person:Beard” but also “Man:Beard” and “Woman:Beard.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/urqR5dzgulw6De3io73nMTqTda4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307966/beard_options_ios_14_5_emojipedia.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Emojipedia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The various beard options in iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOQrNN"&gt;Apple’s update also includes its take on the new smiley faces included in the Unicode Consortium’s newest emoji set, including “Exhaling Face,” “Face with Spiral Eyes,” and “Face in Clouds.” Hearts, another emoji go-to category, also has two new members joining its ranks, “Heart on Fire” and “Mending Heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IddUj2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10345995"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EzyeSy"&gt;All of these emoji were approved by the Unicode Consortium &lt;a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2020/09/emoji-131-now-final-to-be-widely.html"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that vendors could begin integrating them into their products and services at that time. But it’s up to the individual companies to design how emoji look on their devices and services, which is why a smiley face on your iPhone looks different than it does on Twitter. Companies also decide when the new emoji show up — Pixel users, for example, have been able to use the new emoji &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/08/december-patch-brings-unicode-13-1-emoji-to-pixel-devices/"&gt;since December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCztZt"&gt;Apple is also making tweaks to some existing emoji, however: the rock-climbing emoji will now feature a helmet, the syringe emoji is now a more generic one rather than one filled with blood, and the headphones look like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVT3iw"&gt;The syringe change could be a legitimately helpful one for anyone writing about COVID-19. Not only is the new syringe way less intimidating when emptied of blood, but it’s also more applicable to vaccinations, which will hopefully become a lot more common soon. Check out this comparison from Emojipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f2QFNC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple has removed the blood from the syringe emoji in iOS 14.5, making it more versatile to represent vaccination   &lt;a href="https://t.co/tdSiIYB0gI"&gt;https://t.co/tdSiIYB0gI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/3R5gL83Cdz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3R5gL83Cdz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emojipedia (@Emojipedia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Emojipedia/status/1361745569635573775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LgyrLM"&gt;Changing the headphones emoji to resemble AirPods Max, on the other hand, follows a known pattern: Apple regularly inserts its own products into its emoji set as a form of free product placement. (Apple’s mobile phone emoji &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/mobile-phone/"&gt;looks a lot like an iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, for example.) If you want to see just how different the new headphones emoji is, Emojipedia &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Emojipedia/status/1361750732643459075"&gt;made that comparison&lt;/a&gt;, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MFFdNw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In iOS 14.5 beta 2, the   Headphone emoji now displays as AirPods Max &lt;a href="https://t.co/cGkn3ir0G9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cGkn3ir0G9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emojipedia (@Emojipedia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Emojipedia/status/1361750732643459075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sep5W8"&gt;Apple says all of these emoji are available in the new release of the iOS 14.5 beta, which also comes with a nice little change to the Apple Music app. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ll9zje/feature_ios_145_beta_2_swipe_actions_in_music/"&gt;users on Reddit running the beta&lt;/a&gt;, you can now add and remove music from your queue with the same kind of swiping gesture used in Apple’s Mail app to archive, delete, or flag emails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTW4wK"&gt;The full release of iOS 14.5 is also said to include several other helpful additions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;support for the new Xbox and PlayStation controllers&lt;/a&gt;, the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify"&gt;to set Siri’s default music streaming&lt;/a&gt; service to Spotify, and the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;unlock your phone with your Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2e55r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 16th, 8:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added context about the new emoji and the changes to older emoji in iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple won’t have to allow App Store alternatives on iOS after North Dakota bill fails</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mWGwSx"&gt;A North Dakota bill that would have drastically altered the way app store operators like Apple and Google manage their digital marketplaces has failed to garner enough votes, failing in the state senate by an 11-36 vote on Tuesday, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karlarosehanson/status/1361780107619094530"&gt;North Dakota House of Representatives member Karla Rose Hanson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBUfLi"&gt;The bill, SB 2333, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276511/north-dakota-senate-bill-2333-apple-google-app-store-antitrust-monopoly"&gt;stirred considerable controversy last week&lt;/a&gt; when a committee hearing drew the attention of corporate lawyers and lobbyists, experts, and Apple critics arguing both in favor and against the proposed legislation’s potentially far-reaching consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArGIFk"&gt;The bill would have barred any company in the business of software distribution making over $10 million in annual revenue from imposing rules on developers dictating they only use one app store, like the App Store or the Google Play Store, and that they have to use the app store owner’s preferred payment system. Using Apple or Google’s payment system, in turn, lets those companies take 30 percent of most sales, per their long-standing revenue sharing policies around app sales and in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3nYDh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple said the bill would “destroy the iPhone as you know it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QyuXVG"&gt;Requiring developers to use the App Store and Apple’s own payment system are pillars of the iPhone maker’s mobile business and largely responsible for the App Store’s continued financial success. The App Store is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to have generated more than $64 billion&lt;/a&gt; in revenue last year. (Google does allow alternative app stores onto Android, but the company requires users to click through security warnings to download and use such software.) Yet, developers have long complained of Apple’s grip on the flow of revenue on iOS, with critics claiming its ever-changing rules are inconsistently applied and that Apple grants exemptions on a case-by-case basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtfIBU"&gt;Although the bill would only have dictated how companies like Apple operate within the state of North Dakota, the bill’s broad language may have forced Apple to make systemic changes to its business nationwide. The legislation’s success could have also inspired other states to follow suit with similar attempts to regulate app stores’ relationships with developers, although that appears to be already underway despite SB 2333’s failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpBMt6"&gt;In arguing against SB 2333, Apple’s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, testified that the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it,” arguing that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in,” Neuenschwander concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="afeGMT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;North Dakota’s app store bill might have had far-reaching consequences for Apple and Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0spRQA"&gt;The legislation is just one of a growing number of state bills, which now includes proposed bills in Arizona and Georgia, that seek to place limits on the power of Apple and fellow app store owners. A &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;report this weekend&lt;/a&gt; linked the bills to a multi-state lobbying effort from the Coalition for App Fairness, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;industry group formed last fall&lt;/a&gt; consisting of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;creator Epic Games, Tinder parent company Match Group, Spotify, and dozens of other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHNq3Z"&gt;The CAF’s members have for years railed against the App Store and Apple’s mandate that it take 30 percent of all app sales and in-app purchases. The group is now dedicating its efforts to supporting legislation taking aim at Apple and its App Store policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ybrKQ"&gt;SB 2333 was proposed by Sen. Kyle Davison (R-Fargo) after the state senator was approached by Lacee Bjork Anderson, a lobbyist with the firm Odney Public Affairs based in Bismarck, North Dakota who gave a draft proposal to Davison. Anderson, it turns out, was hired by both the CAF and Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFXQ68"&gt;Epic is also suing Apple and Google after both companies removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last August, following Epic’s decision to include its own in-app payment system in the iOS and Android versions of the battle royale hit. Epic was not the only CAF member that submitted testimony supporting SB 2333; Basecamp. Match Group, and Tile all submitted testimony, too, a CAF spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Al1fCl"&gt;In a tweet, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney acknowledged Epic and the Coalition for App Fairness’ participation in the ongoing lobbying efforts. “North Dakota’s effort to combat app store monopolies is awesome for consumers and developers,” Sweeney wrote. “The Coalition for App Fairness organized the outreach, lobbying, and developer participation. Can’t take credit for it, but Epic is proud to be a part of it!” &lt;/p&gt;
