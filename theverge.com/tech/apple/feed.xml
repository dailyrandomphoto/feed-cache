    <title>Apple’s digital driver’s license has been delayed to next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DRTLm7NE55KMdFk1uVaiSgpC6w=/0x259:1423x1208/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70184873/lcimg_f986f942_4ae9_4c26_ad87_37d148f9859d.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zueeoL"&gt;Apple’s digital driver’s license / ID feature won’t be coming until “early 2022,” according to an update to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 page&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/23/apple-delays-ios-15-wallet-id-feature-early-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; noticed&lt;/a&gt;. The change comes after news broke that Apple was looking for strict control over how states roll out the feature, which was previously listed as coming late this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrrzQa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Originally announced at WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Apple says that the feature will let you use its Wallet app to store your digital identification for use at airport security checkpoints. Of course, the system is dependent on your state supporting it — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652051/apple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt; that Arizona and Georgia would be the first to let citizens add their licenses to their phones (with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah following later) but didn’t specify when exactly that would be happening.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fx8kOyrZGyq6vB6feS39yxgy7Zo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23038550/Screen_Shot_2021_11_23_at_13.36.54.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211116015952/https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WayBack Machine capture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; from earlier this month shows that the “Coming early 2022” text was added recently.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lsQrOt"&gt;Earlier this month, a report showed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22781570/apple-making-states-pay-digital-id-service"&gt;how restrictive Apple’s contracts with the states&lt;/a&gt; chosen to lead the program are. &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; said, according to the contracts it viewed from Georgia, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Kentucky, that Apple has “sole discretion” concerning how the states marketed the program, how they reported on its success, and even the date that they launched the program and the devices they’re allowed to mark as compatible. States, and therefore taxpayers, are also responsible for funding the program, despite Apple choosing when it launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGkaJB"&gt;Apple does have conflicting info on its site about when digital IDs will be available — iOS 15’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/features/"&gt;“All New Features” page&lt;/a&gt; still says the feature is coming in “late 2021,” but it’s difficult to see that happening now. The holidays and the vacations that come with them are fast approaching, which traditionally makes projects difficult to complete, especially if other organizations (in this case, the state governments) are involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LDdK0"&gt;The feature wasn’t alone in missing the official iOS 15 launch — the new version of the OS was released without a good chunk of the major features that Apple had announced on stage. Many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;have been added&lt;/a&gt; through updates or have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;shown up in the beta&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming iOS 15.2, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;Universal Control is still missing&lt;/a&gt; for those wanting to control their Macs and iPads with the same mouse and keyboard. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733044/macos-universal-control-later-this-fall-monterey-feature-delay"&gt;still promising&lt;/a&gt; it’ll launch “later this fall.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple sues NSO Group for attacking iPhones with Pegasus spyware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-EGsMPxGf0PtaoDncVOe6B8NEA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183455/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oJFqiU"&gt;Now Apple has followed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20938676/whatsapp-nso-group-spyware-hack-encrypted-chat-lawsuit"&gt;WhatsApp and its parent company Meta&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Facebook) in &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-sues-nso-group-to-curb-the-abuse-of-state-sponsored-spyware/"&gt;suing Pegasus spyware maker NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;. Along with promising new information about how NSO Group infected targeted iPhones via a zero-click exploit that researchers later dubbed ForcedEntry, Apple says it’s “seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ck7oLY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple: NSO agreed to the iCloud Terms of Service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rpQ3TQ"&gt;Senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761724/apple-craig-federighi-ios-sideloading-web-summit-2021-european-commission-digital-markets-act"&gt;didn’t mention sideloading this time&lt;/a&gt; but says in a statement, “State-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability. That needs to change...Apple devices are the most secure consumer hardware on the market — but private companies developing state-sponsored spyware have become even more dangerous.” Apple and WhatsApp aren’t alone in their push against NSO Group in court, as last year, tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22194930/microsoft-google-cisco-vmware-internet-association-amicus-brief-nso-group-spyware-whatsapp-facebook"&gt;including Microsoft and Google filed a brief supporting Facebook’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYaPnj"&gt;Pegasus spyware is designed to let governments remotely access a phone’s microphones, cameras, and other data on both iPhones and Androids, according to Apple’s press release. It’s also designed to be able to infect phones without requiring any action from the user and without leaving a trace, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;reports that came out earlier&lt;/a&gt; this year from a journalistic coalition called the Pegasus Project and Apple’s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zuwfvv"&gt;Apple also cites reports that the spyware has been used against journalists, activists, and politicians, despite &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;NSO’s claims&lt;/a&gt; that its governmental clients are forbidden from using the spyware against those sorts of targets. It’s understandable why Apple, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169781/apple-google-privacy-troll-billboard"&gt;“what happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone” company&lt;/a&gt;, would be upset about its devices and services being used to carry out what it calls “human rights abuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0UK4TH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The lawsuit is a “stake in the ground” for Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmGje8"&gt;Apple’s senior director of commercial litigation Heather Grenier says in a statement to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/technology/apple-nso-group-lawsuit.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the lawsuit is meant to be a “stake in the ground, to send a clear signal” that the company won’t allow its users to suffer “this type of abuse.” Part of Apple’s argument &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/Apple_v_NSO_Complaint_112321.pdf"&gt;laid out in the complaint&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) is that NSO violated Apple’s terms of service because the group created “more than one hundred” Apple IDs to help it send data to targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8cZ79H"&gt;The Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because, on information and belief, they created more than one hundred Apple IDs to carry out their attacks and also agreed to Apple’s iCloud Terms and Conditions (“iCloud Terms”), including a mandatory and enforceable forum selection and exclusive jurisdiction clause that constitutes express consent to the jurisdiction of this Court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="znIVpi"&gt;In Apple’s complaint, it breaks down how the attack worked — using the Apple IDs it created, NSO would send data to a target via iMessage (after determining that they were using an iPhone), which was maliciously crafted to turn off the iPhone’s logging. That would then let NSO secretly install the Pegasus spyware and control what was being collected on the phone. Apple says that the specific vulnerability that NSO was using was patched in iOS 14.8, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672352/apple-spyware-gateway-iphone-software-update-nso-pegasus"&gt;you can read more about here&lt;/a&gt;. The summary is that NSO was sending files that exploited a bug in how iMessage rendered GIFs and PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E62I1t"&gt;Apple says in its press release that, thanks to improvements it’s made to iOS 15 security, it “has not observed any evidence of successful remote attacks against devices running iOS 15 and later versions.” When the Pegasus Project was publishing its reports in July, Amnesty International said that the latest versions of iOS (at the time iOS 14.6) were susceptible to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K40P9H"&gt;For more information about the reporting done on Pegasus, its capabilities, and its potential targets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;see our explainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nI8lDS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NSO’s Pegasus spyware: here’s what we know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jMtOKu"&gt;In addition to its lawsuit against NSO, Apple says it’ll be supporting “organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy,” both financially and with technical resources. The company says it’ll distribute $10 million (plus any damages it wins from its lawsuit) to groups working on counter-surveillance and pledges in its press release to give free “technical, threat intelligence, and engineering assistance” to Citizen Lab, a group of researchers that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672352/apple-spyware-gateway-iphone-software-update-nso-pegasus"&gt;were involved with the Pegasus Project&lt;/a&gt; and that helped Apple discover and patch NSO’s exploits. Apple also says it’ll do the same for other organizations “where appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ozzFC"&gt;NSO was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761565/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-entity-list-us-government-human-rights"&gt;recently added to the US Entity List&lt;/a&gt;, which limits the ways American companies can sell or provide their technology to the company. According to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/11/23/1040509/france-macron-nso-in-crisis-sanctions/"&gt;a report by the MIT Technology Review&lt;/a&gt;, the sanction has been seriously detrimental both to employee morale at NSO Group, and the company’s ability to do business. The report says the company has to request permission from the US government to purchase items like laptops running Windows and iPhones, and that the government has said its default decision would be to turn down those requests.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals under $25</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/InnS7S5uPiCAjrbGIvGg1i-jofo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181956/dseifert_181011_3006_1141.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the best affordable smart speakers you can get is just $20 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ld9a3y"&gt;If our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"&gt;best early Black Friday deals under $50&lt;/a&gt; was outside your budget, don’t worry: there’s also plenty you can buy for under $25. Several retailers are now heavily discounting popular tech products in the short lead-up to Black Friday, discounting everything from Bluetooth trackers and smart speakers to the latest gaming subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Va5kw"&gt;For your convenience, we’ve curated a list of some of the best sub-$25 options below. If you’re looking for more holiday gift ideas that won’t break the bank, however, we’ve also put together separate budget-based gift guides for items under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745314/holiday-gift-guide-under-25-cheap-tech-2021-best-ideas"&gt;$25&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"&gt;$50&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UG2Xy7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The Verge’s Guide to Black Friday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pgirnc"&gt;For iPhone owners planning on traveling this holiday season, Amazon’s offering a great deal on Apple’s official AirTag Loop. Given that AirTags lack a lanyard hole of their own, you’ll need such a loop to securely attach them to luggage, keys, and other items. Unfortunately, these loops can be as expensive as the AirTags themselves. Thankfully, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirTag-Loop-Deep-Navy/dp/B0932LZM6K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is currently discounting the loop made to carry Apple’s popular Bluetooth tracker, selling it an all-time low of around $20 instead of $29. This deal is valid on the deep navy colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XnECMp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880413"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOcQkL"&gt;Like Apple’s AirTag, Samsung Galaxy SmartTag Plus locates lost items ranging from keys to pets. Even though it can work with both iOS and Android devices, we recommend it more for Samsung users as it’s designed to work best with Samsung Galaxy devices. The convenient Bluetooth tracker features an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio so you can more accurately track items and use the AR mode to see exactly where your missing tag is. To use the UWB radio, though, you’ll need a compatible UWB-equipped Galaxy phone. The tracker can also be used as a remote control for Samsung smart home stuff. It’s a great buy for those embedded within the Samsung ecosystem, especially right now, as the tracker is going for $25 instead of $40 today at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartTag-Bluetooth-Tracker-Locator/dp/B08NRNSVRK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://api.narrativ.com/api/v0/client_redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fgalaxy-a-smart-tag-1-pack-black-ei-t7300bbegus%2F%3Fnrtv_cid%3D.nrtv_plchldr.%26cid%3Dopmc-ecomm-nrtiv-mobacc-042720-142010-verge-8259575%26utm_source%3Dverge%26utm_medium%3Dnarrativ%26utm_campaign%3D8259575%26utm_content%3Dmobacc%26nrtv_as_src%3D1&amp;amp;a=1745743455626377571&amp;amp;uuid=b35751ff-a0af-4e83-9776-063d4c38d134&amp;amp;uid_bam=1750571413629784227&amp;amp;ar=1758359825979119625" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22570161/apple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PULPjx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyPzUR"&gt;For Xbox owners, we found a phenomenal deal from &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-xbox-one-digital/-/A-76626995&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11222021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22560195%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, where you can pick up a three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate pass for $25 instead of its usual $45 — which is nearly 50 percent off. This pass gives Xbox owners access to online multiplayer and exclusive deals, as well as EA Play tiles and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud. It also offers access to more than 100 Xbox titles for a flat, monthly fee, including &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;launches next month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cBwzN1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k5hzbg"&gt;It may be an older model, but the third-generation Echo Dot is still a great device that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;we once called&lt;/a&gt; the best cheap smart speaker you can buy. It’s far superior to its predecessor, with a loud and rich sound we praised. Right now, you can pick one up with a free Sengled smart bulb from Amazon for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen-Bluetooth/dp/B08YT3BWMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $35 on an otherwise $55 bundle. If you don’t want the color bulb, you can also opt for six months free of Amazon Music Unlimited instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7nnaNh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vLMzzl"&gt;For those who prefer Google smart speakers, the Google Nest Mini is currently 50 percent off at multiple retailers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called the small smart speaker a great upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini, one that sounds far better. The Nest Mini also makes it easy to add Google Assistant to your home. It lacks the Echo Dot’s 3.5mm jack that allows for a wired connection, but, unlike Amazon’s device, you can hang it on your wall without extra accessories. Right now, you can pick one up in various colors for 50 percent off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/google_nest_mini?hl=en-US"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Nest-Mini-2nd-Generation-Charcoal/741412707?athbdg=L1300&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LKg5XqS2?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fblack-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/google-nest-mini-2nd-generation/-/A-78589456?preselect=76500134#lnk=sametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which are all selling the speaker for $25. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QDsK5U"&gt;Streaming sticks are also heavily discounted right now, especially over on Amazon. At the moment, Amazon is even taking 50 percent off of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XVYZ1Y5?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=124&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbea42d-e732-8263-21f&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22553294%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;older Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with the third-gen Alexa remote. Typically $50, you can pick one up right now for $25, the device’s best price to date. It may not be as capable as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; (which is currently selling for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08MQZXN1X?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=94&amp;amp;imprToken=1abea435-1abd-7fcc-e1c&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22548186%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35&lt;/a&gt; instead of $55), but it’s still plenty fast and supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10 Plus, and HDR10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="u5Bg1h"&gt;Those curious about Google’s Stadia game streaming service may want to check out this Stadia Premiere Edition bundle discount, which is available for more than 70 percent off. The $80 bundle comes with a white Stadia controller, as well as a 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is selling for just $22&lt;/a&gt;, which equates to around $58 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;

While we weren’t blown away by the camera, we found that it still offers good video and audio quality for its price. Typically $35, you can buy the already affordable camera for $20 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8qbwNvRtOz3aWm0Swd3D9CY2VoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166146/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The AirPods Pro with the MagSafe charging case are on sale for just $190 at Amazon. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for a great Apple deal this Black Friday season, you shouldn’t shop at Apple. That’s because Apple doesn’t typically offer discounts on its new products in-store or on its website, at least outside of the occasional educational discount. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Even better, these retailers have already started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if you’re looking to save even more, make sure to check out our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re highlighting the best deals across all brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DpLcAU"&gt;The third-gen AirPods were released just last month, and now you can buy them for sale. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the true wireless earbuds for $170 instead of $179. The latest AirPods boast a MagSafe-ready charging case and shorter stems, as well as better battery life and water resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lLCckh"&gt;Apple’s second generation of true wireless earbuds, the AirPods, are selling for $115 instead of $159 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This particular model comes with a wired charging case, however, you can pick up a pair with the wireless charging case for $150 instead of $200 from &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F482532021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="nAbiSM"&gt;The 64GB, Wi-Fi version of the 10.9-inch iPad Air is selling for $539 instead of $600 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F149437127&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in rose gold, while the space gray version is just $10 extra. Released in 2020, the latest model offers thinner bezels around the display and a Touch ID sensor embedded in the power button. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RVzOFA"&gt;Last year’s M1-equipped MacBook Air is, in our opinion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;the best laptop&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. Right now, you can buy the 512GB model with 16GB of RAM for $1,399 in gold or space gray at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604840-REG%2Fapple_z125_mgn7_04_bh_13_3_macbook_air_with.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x1080441%2FSID%2Fprice-guide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22787892%2Fapple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ULdok1"&gt;Last year’s 27-inch iMac comes with an improved 1080p webcam, as well as a notable performance increase over its predecessor. Right now, you can pick it up for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Retina-Display-27-inch-Storage/dp/B08F8ZPRGW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,699&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,799 when you choose the Core i5 model with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356416/apple-imac-27-2020-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

The stylus is compatible with the latest entry-level iPad and a range of earlier models, and it differs from the second-gen model in that you need to plug it into your iPad’s Lightning port in order to charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone SE (2020), Pixel 5A, OnePlus Nord N200 5G, TCL 20S, Moto G Pure, Samsung Galaxy A52 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHxEoXqr1i6JVkup6wsoJeDPpyY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/best_phone_grid_16x9.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best budget phones of 2021: iiPhone SE (2020), Pixel 5A, OnePlus Nord N200 5G, TCL 20S, Moto G Pure, Samsung Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a 90Hz screen, or 5G support&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WJAPbS"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget this holiday season, we’ve got good news: you’re more likely to find mid-range sub-$500 phones available than many of the hottest flagships of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZY6SyC"&gt;Due to an unfortunate series of events — from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;ongoing chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, labor shortage, the pandemic, and global shipping delays — retailers are having a hard time keeping phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 or iPhone 13 Pro in stock; Samsung has been hit particularly hard with supply issues all year. Fortunately, there are many excellent alternatives that are nearly as capable and cost a lot less to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU3Cg6"&gt;Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are also finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with lower prices and more premium features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoCnCZ"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone&lt;em&gt; that &lt;/em&gt;much harder. It’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything well at this price point. So prioritize the features that matter most to you, whether it’s 5G compatibility with a particular network, high-resolution screen, low price, best camera, or longevity with software updates. It’s difficult to get straight A’s in every single one of these needs, but if you’re able to tolerate the occasional B, you’ll find a phone you’ll love. We recommend getting an unlocked phone for the best price and portability, but you might find better deals by buying through a carrier and signing up for a wireless plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Svhy7y"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s well over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people. While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;If you’re looking for the best budget Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; is our top choice. You’ll find an all-around good phone with a flagship-level camera, three years of software updates from Google, plus IP67 water resistance — all at a lower price than last year’s model.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE 2020 (2nd-generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best iPhone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QjIUAS"&gt;Apple’s iPhone SE 2020 (2nd-generation) strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9YYEN"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today, which also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High-refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, but you won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TvHua"&gt;The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is two years behind the latest and greatest and won’t win any benchmark races. (That would be the A15 chipset in the iPhone 13 lineup.) It’s still plenty performant, though, and it’s often hard to tell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="878itp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re looking for the fastest wireless connectivity, the SE is not going to provide it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x5bwzf"&gt;the difference between a two-year-old iPhone processor and a brand-new one in use. But why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in comparison to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUd3WA"&gt;Cellular connectivity is limited to LTE, which is fine for now but might be limiting in a few years when 5G networks become more widely available. If you’re looking for the fastest wireless connectivity, the SE is not going to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A’s 6.34-inch screen isn’t huge, but it’s just big enough to not look out of place next to the 6.5-inch competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B9aQm4"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7LCnMV"&gt;If you’re looking for the best sub-$500 Android phone, the Pixel 5A is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZV88A"&gt;The $449 Pixel 5A has a 6.34-inch OLED screen that’s on the smaller side for the budget class, but it’s bigger than the previous-gen 6.2-inch panel on the Pixel 4A 5G. There’s a bigger battery, too: a 4,680mAh cell that will last through a full day of heavy use and well into day two if you’re a lighter user. The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance for added peace of mind in the event of accidental spills or tumbles into water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD7mEy"&gt;That’s more or less the extent of the 5A’s improvements over its predecessor. The 5A’s dual rear-facing cameras (main and ultrawide), Snapdragon 765G processor, as well as the 6GB RAM and 128GB storage combination, were inherited from the 4A 5G and still deliver solid performance in this iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4bk7u"&gt;Software is another area where Pixel phones shine, and the 5A is no exception. It launched with Google’s own Android 11 OS and has already gotten upgraded to Android 12. The software is refreshingly free of the added clutter that other manufacturers sometimes pile onto it. The Pixel 5A is also guaranteed three years of OS upgrades and security updates, which isn’t quite as long as Apple or Samsung’s standard software support timespan but is certainly better than a lot of the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uppsrx"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity. You won’t get the super-fast mmWave flavor of 5G support, but you will be able to access the slower but more common, sub-6GHz 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L7fhLs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cubsS1"&gt;But there’s a weird question mark over whether Google will support another set of frequencies that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will start using in the near future called the C-band. The company isn’t committing to making the necessary software update to use it, despite supporting it in hardware. It’s a strange blemish on the 5A’s otherwise strong feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHUScD"&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release: it isn’t being sold through any of the major US carriers, but you can buy it from the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/pixel-5a-5g?id=CR6HaBzv0AUAEggeh2gc79AFAA%3D%3D"&gt;Google Fi&lt;/a&gt;. All in, the Pixel 5A is still the budget Android phone we’d recommend. It’s not flashy, but it’s well priced and has it where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7CPw9a"&gt;The best phone display for $500 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qpM5xB"&gt;If you’re looking for the best display for your money, the $500 Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is a great option for future-proofing your phone, albeit at the very top of this buying guide’s price range, but it’s well worth its higher price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fpya2a"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now, the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99z3je"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise, everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating are handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIU18y"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="85J3ce"&gt;&lt;q&gt;more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C4ZNpo"&gt;includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 5A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INZwJl"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by, so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nCclP5"&gt;Best 5G phone for under $300 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RmpXOg"&gt;At $299, the OnePlus N10 5G brings 5G and some upscale features to a budget phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge4QQF"&gt;While you won’t find a fantastic screen here, its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits and only supports sub-6Hz 5G networks. It launched with Android 10, and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XlPkb6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t expect to get Android 12 on this model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y4Y1Qv"&gt;OnePlus has released the update to Android 11 already. But that’s it — don’t expect to get Android 12 on this model. OnePlus is offering two years of security updates in addition to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FucmrC"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 5A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB1WYg"&gt;If you prefer Samsung phones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is also well worth your consideration for two very good reasons: it’s a bit less expensive at $279 and will be supported with security updates for the next four years. However, it lacks some of the N10’s nicer features, like a higher refresh rate screen, good cameras, and a nicer implementation of Android. The A32 5G is a better pick if you want to hang on to your phone for as many years as possible, but the N10 is a more likable device overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOtHJH"&gt;What if both the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G and the OnePlus Nord N10 5G are just beyond your budget, but you still want a 5G-ready phone in this price bracket? Luckily for you, the unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; retails for $240 (or lower from carriers) and includes some fancy features as well. You’ll be treated to a 1080p display that refreshes at 90Hz and a 5,000mAh battery, but it only includes 64GB of internal storage. Yes, it only works on T-Mobile’s sub-6GHz 5G network but will function as a 4G phone on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. For the price, it’s not a bad way to get in on all the 5G action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Oj4ljX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best 4G phone under $300&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="npapoA"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, and good battery life, all for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRkfu4"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’ vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HhlvTs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S is a solid choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rA2h68"&gt;While the 20S’ camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLPoSw"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S is a solid choice that should work on all major 4G networks in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;The best budget phone with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MC6Jne"&gt;It’s slim pickings for Android users who want a new budget phone with a stylus. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;LG exiting the smartphone market this year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;Samsung pausing (or perhaps ending) its premium Galaxy Note series&lt;/a&gt;, there’s only Motorola’s Moto G Stylus left to hold the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Y0rd"&gt;Of the Motorola budget devices we’ve tested this year, the Moto G Stylus (2021) offers the best balance of features and cost-saving measures. It’s a good phone for $280, whether you’re a stylus devotee or just stylus-curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyyTGB"&gt;It has a big 6.8-inch LCD display at 1080p resolution, good battery life with its 4,000mAh cell, and ample internal storage with 128GB of capacity. Thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 678 processor and 4GB of RAM, the G Stylus performs just fine with the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3VEksQ"&gt;occasional hiccup. The cameras, though flawed, are good enough to get by. You won’t find an amazing night mode or top-notch picture quality here, but for a sub-$300 phone, it does the job just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44WwOS"&gt;The Moto G Stylus’ stylus is built into the device like the Galaxy Note. Popping it out brings up a quick menu of shortcuts to stylus-friendly apps, like its coloring book app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5Ppnc"&gt;There’s no telling how much longer Motorola will make the Moto G Stylus, so if you want a budget phone with a built-in stylus, you should grab one while you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. TCL 20SE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The best 4G phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3LcHIR"&gt;There are not many great phones available in the sub-$200 range, but the $190 TCL 20SE is a rare gem of its class. It has a 5,000mAh battery, ample onboard storage, and a beautiful “nano-photoetched” back that makes this budget phone look more expensive than it is, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPgkC4"&gt;As the most affordable model of the TCL 20 series, the TCL 20SE has a gigantic 6.82-inch display that is quite low in resolution at 720p but delivers brighter and more vibrant colors than other phones in its class — thanks to TCL’s television screen expertise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbBgrN"&gt;The 20SE’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor is supported by 4G of RAM, where they work well enough together to make &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; mostly playable, albeit with a slight lag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7K8RPt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This budget phone looks more expensive than it is&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UeESwB"&gt;Unlike other budget phones in this space, the 20SE comes with a generous 128GB of internal storage, plus a micro SD card slot for even more capacity. In addition, its 5,000mAh battery lasted a whopping 32 hours on one charge, using only Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1o43"&gt;While the 20SE’s 48-megapixel main camera can take great snaps in natural light, it’s not really meant for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfkexN"&gt;All things considered, TCL 20SE is a smart choice for a sub-$200 4G phone, especially If you won’t be using Verizon as your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;However, if you’re on an even tighter budget and need a 4G phone that will work on all the major carriers, you should consider Motorola’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787370/moto-g-pure-review-4g-android-budget-phone"&gt;Moto G Pure&lt;/a&gt;. Retailing at $160 for the unlocked version, you may be able to find deals as low as free at some carriers — if you sign up for a plan this holiday season. While the Moto G Pure is slower and smaller than the TCL 20SE, it has a more capable 13-megapixel main camera (f/2.2 aperture) that works admirably in low-light situations. Unfortunately, the G Pure only comes with a paltry 32GB of internal storage, so you’ll need to budget for a microSD card to expand its extremely limited capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yq4gTc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875340"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch SE costs just $219 at Amazon and Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vGNEa1PrOUMerlqjGUsjdcDgiM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177423/dseifert_200930_4218_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="82lp7r"&gt;A proverbial tidal wave of deals crashed down this morning, heralding the beginning of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday week&lt;/a&gt;. As I searched for deals to include in this roundup, I kept finding one after the other that was better. If you think these are good, consider acting fast, as it’s impossible to tell if they’ll stick around all week or if they’re just a flash in the pan. The very best discount that kicked off recently is a big $60 discount on the Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2ht3XXw2g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Starlight/dp/B09G9FS5YN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Regularly selling for $279, it’s just $219 — the lowest price yet. If you want the larger 44mm-sized model, it’s $249 instead of $309. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3pUJv7ioh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can shop all of the sizes and colorways right here at Best Buy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhOMfR"&gt;We heartily recommend the SE over the Apple Watch Series 3, despite the fact that the Series 3 is seeing tremendous discounts at Walmart (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it will be just $109 starting tonight&lt;/a&gt;). The Apple Watch SE is considerably faster and more capable, with additional features and more storage to make updating its software far less of a hassle. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the latest model of Samsung’s pocket-friendly portable SSD, and it’s just $110 instead of $170. We’ve seen it reach a low of $140 before, but this is yet another unprecedented Black Friday deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2t910"&gt;When the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262517/samsung-t7-usb-c-nvme-portable-ssd-speed-t5-comparison-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T7 launched in mid-2020&lt;/a&gt;, its 500GB version sold for the same $110 price that the model with twice its internal storage capacity is selling for today. It includes a Type-A adapter in case you’re a little lacking in compatible devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aAl6cu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556309"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r91QDa"&gt;You can snag a digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; for Xbox (compatible with Xbox One, Series S, or Series X) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Effect-Legendary-Xbox-Digital/dp/B08ZFDL2RK?th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $28 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The deal has wiggled well below its original $60 price a few times before, but it hasn’t gone below about $35. This collection contains the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; trilogy and several DLC items, all looking fresh to death in 4K (that is, if your console outputs to 4K).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PGVmZx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9565277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Also, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/21/22789487/oculus-quest-2-vr-headset-50-gift-card-black-friday-promo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the gift card promo for the Oculus Quest 2 is happening&lt;/a&gt;, and several retailers will toss in a $50 gift card with the purchase of a headset at regular price.&lt;/p&gt;

Believe it or not, that is this model’s lowest price yet, dropping $400 off its usual price. This ultrawide monitor has a QLED panel with a 5120 x 1440 resolution, a 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and support for G-Sync and FreeSync Premium Pro adaptive sync. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My colleague Sean Hollister reviewed this model&lt;/a&gt;, and he was impressed with its vivid colors and 1,000 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ymSCVgQ1EyxfS2GWFiLZ64jXkoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177196/cwelch_202109_4775_5619.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5KTAD"&gt;Whether you’re overdue for a new pair or are just trying to cancel out the usual onslaught of holiday music, Black Friday season is a great time to invest in some noise-canceling headphones. You’ll find significant discounts on many of our favorite headphones featured in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;noise-canceling headphones buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. These include picks from Sony, Bose, Apple, Sennheiser, and others. In some cases, these deals will save you $100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKhJxM"&gt;Aside from the steep discounts, another good thing about buying headphones during the holidays is the extended return period at many retailers. That gives you plenty of time to try out your new cans and make sure the sound quality, ANC, comfort, and other factors are all to your liking before you’re stuck with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="maTlax"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021: news, deal highlights, and money-saving tips ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"},{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="BdzHRb"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones deals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="zyLNwd"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 remain our overall pick as the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy today. They’ve got excellent noise cancellation, lively bass-forward sound, and fantastic comfort. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="3mytn2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875864"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ApgUlE"&gt;Released only a few months ago, Bose’s QuietComfort 45 headphones mark a return to the company’s classic design that has no equal when it comes to comfort. You can wear these things for hours upon hours without any issues. It also helps that Bose made improvements to sound quality and ANC compared to the QC35 II headphones. The QC45s haven’t really been on sale since their release, so the Black Friday 2021 deals are coming at just the right time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="D4gpLa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="3wgngs"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max can be had for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$439 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from their hefty $549 standard price. You’ll get that deal on the black, blue, and white colors, though green and pink are a bit higher (but still on sale) at $479.  The AirPods Max justify their price with top-tier sound quality, terrific noise cancellation, great voice call performance, and the usual deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jCtQQh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880023"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="pmB83v"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 Wireless &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are all the way down to $247.46&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon, saving you over $100 compared to their regular $400 price tag. With a classy, premium look and feel that’s matched by their phenomenal audio quality, the Momentum 3s are perhaps the best choice if you’re focused on sublime sound over everything else. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Android Messages update handles Apple iMessage reactions properly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NAXtKbozF3_Upjkdjw3HD7l8kX0=/0x0:975x650/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70176817/IMG_1706.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example emoji reaction in iMessage.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Apple Messages&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q06io8"&gt;An update to Google Messages on Android allows it to properly display emoji reactions sent from the iPhone’s Messages app, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/19/google-messages-imessage-reaction-emoji/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQpmVG"&gt;The update addresses a long-standing issue that occurs when users of Apple’s iMessage service chat with friends using the Messages app on Android. Previously, when an iPhone user reacted to an Android user’s message using an emoji, it appeared as a separate text message when received on Android, often resulting in confusion and lots of unnecessary clutter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68ENREEDia6isDqwUmDxxIuijxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034040/Screenshot_20211122_070026_Messages.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Google Messages&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old method generated a separate message for each reaction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new approach is much cleaner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oklXEr"&gt;After the update, however, the message flow is a lot simpler. Screenshots posted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; show how the emoji reactions appear attached to the intended text, as though they were sent by another Google Messages user. Tapping on an emoji reaction displays a popup saying that it’s been “Translated from iPhone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5mPqR"&gt;Interestingly, emoji reactions sent from iPhone seem to sometimes appear as different emoji on Android. The heart emoji, for example, reportedly appears as heart-eyes on Android. iPhone users can also retroactively change their emoji reaction, and the change will be reflected seamlessly in the Android app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YktFlU"&gt;The feature doesn’t appear to have widely rolled out just yet, even for users with the latest beta version of the Google Messages app — we tried but were unable to force the emoji reactions to display in our own tests. But when it arrives, it should remove a small point of friction in iPhone to Android communications, even if it’s still a far cry from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;offering iMessage natively on Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXylBo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnj7M1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foundation’s first season loses itself in its century-spanning story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLDiXPv_2oxkfcj6JKkREHM-0t8=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70170346/Foundation_Photo_011003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s ambitious epic takes a while to get going&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5ikwZZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s first season has officially wrapped with its season finale, which saw the first chapter of Apple TV Plus’ most ambitious show come to a conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvLslI"&gt;The epic sci-fi show, based on Isaac Asimov’s centuries-spanning series of novels, has grown far beyond its quasi-magic space math &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;from the initial episodes&lt;/a&gt;, spinning out different storylines ranging from drama in the Foundation’s newfound home of Terminus to the byzantine imperial politics of Trantor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz2Vqu"&gt;In the wake of the finale, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s Chaim Gartenberg and Andrew Webster are revisiting the show to see what worked, what didn’t, and what they’re hoping to see in the already-announced second season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjnbBE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for the entire first season of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8IqBfgNL4xbz_pyw-C_hJVkafWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028213/Foundation_Photo_010904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj4K4l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m really of two minds about &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;. With the first season in the bag, I’m actually really enjoying the show as interesting, high-concept sci-fi. But the story that’s being told here is emphatically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that of &lt;em&gt;Foundation &lt;/em&gt;from the Asimov books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6O35S"&gt;I get that there’s bound to be differences in adapting a seven-book series (not counting the expanded &lt;em&gt;Empire &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Robot&lt;/em&gt; stories that Asimov later tied into a mostly cohesive whole) that was retroactively forged into books out of numerous short stories aiming to tell a story spanning 1,000 years of human history. But even with that said, after borrowing the basic premise — the Empire is going to fall and mankind will suffer 30,000 years of darkness unless something is done to cushion the dark age to 1,000 years, because “fancy math” — &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; just seems wholly uninterested in exploring that concept past the first episode or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oshlRK"&gt;The individual stories here are generally interesting on their own. The “genetic dynasty” of a succession of Lee Paces ruling the crumbling empire with an iron fist is the show’s highlight, thanks in no small part to Pace’s dynamic performances as the cloned Brother Day. And Salvor Hardin’s cat-and-mouse game on Terminus with the Anacreons is enjoyable sci-fi fare, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOpLTS"&gt;Meanwhile, the third leg of the story, the prolonged drama of Gaal’s shuttling in cryo from place to place as the show hints at her mysterious powers, is… less compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOZ3O5"&gt;The practical concerns of running a multi-season TV series also clearly impact the show. Some characters, like the Cleon clones or the seemingly immortal robot Demerzel, play well into the themes of the series and help give weight to the sheer size and scale of the Empire. But by the end of the finale, it felt like the show was twisting itself in knots to keep key characters like Hardin and Gaal around through multiple eras of the show so that the actors playing them could offer some continuity for the next season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMXhWqWlb9w0hdwpkT2LE_X2gdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028228/Foundation_Photo_010605.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8WQURB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m not as well-versed on the source material, but I generally agree. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;Once all of the initial worldbuilding and discussion of future-predicting math was out of the way in the first few episodes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; really picked up in a lot of ways. The worldbuilding remains incredible throughout. All of the many cultures and planets have a depth to them that is quite frankly astounding. That goes for the big things — like a desert planet’s incredibly detailed religious beliefs and ceremonies or the sheer scale of the landscapes you see — to the smaller moments, like the scratches on an old spacesuit or the way each culture has its own particular style of dress and armor. You can tell there was a huge budget here, and it was put to good use. (Even the special effects that seem out of place, like a certain robot skull in the finale, look amazing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyIGrI"&gt;Early on, I really struggled to identify with any of the cast. It was all setup and vanishingly little character development. As the story developed, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s confusing structure continued to make this a struggle. It jumps around &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, both in terms of the stories it’s focused on and the timeline. There’s just so much going on, and so much complexity — Harri Seldon’s plan seemed complicated at first, but the many layers (and lies) it ends up involving made it even harder to follow — that’s only compounded by the fact that many of the characters live years beyond their life span through cryo-sleep or other means. Oh, and then there are the multiple generations of the emperor, all played by the same three actors, making things even harder to follow. It also doesn’t help that the show is far too serious all the time. I get that the fate of the universe is important, but &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; could definitely use a sense of humor to lighten the mood at times and let me connect to its cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6bWJG"&gt;It wasn’t until episode eight, where Lee Pace’s emperor faces a life-threatening trek through a desert, where I felt like I was finally getting to know these characters. Up until then, the show seemed more focused on the universe as a whole than it did the individual people whose stories it’s telling. Once it slowed down, though, and allowed viewers longer and quieter moments with the cast, it really worked. And like you said, even when they don’t have much to work with, much of the cast here does great with what’s in front of them — especially the villains. Pace exudes a cold calculating menace that borders on sociopathic, while Kubbra Sait, as the grand huntress of the planet of Anacreon, is terrifyingly focused on vengeance above all else. Another highlight is T’Nia Miller as a devout religious leader who stands tall against the empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a2qcwQJzcoYaAYwl4ZEjkLBCBFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028233/Foundation_Photo_010802.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5HKnWC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll join you in praising the worldbuilding: &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; always looks incredible, from claustrophobic hallways on a derelict ship to the sweeping salt deserts to the stark stone of Terminus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w31CFZ"&gt;And the slower pace and steadily built-out cast do help flesh out the latter characters a lot more than Gaal, Hari, or Raych get throughout the first two episodes. Salvor’s extended screentime means that we get to know her, the often contentious relationship she has with her parents and the Foundation’s leadership, and her romantic fling with the Han Solo-esque Hugu (Daniel MacPherson, who helps add a much-needed lightness of tone whenever he shows up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPUSIo"&gt;The show also uses the time to raise some thoughts about the idea of religion and faith versus science and human effort, and the blurred lines between them, particularly as Seldin’s elaborate plan is revealed to help establish himself as a mythological figure in the history of the Foundation. It’s these sorts of parallels that &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t quite fully dig into, although hopefully the show will continue to explore those areas in season 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jGujg"&gt;But&lt;em&gt; Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s pace and added filler also has me raising some eyebrows at the show’s future. One of the draws of the original series is how it skips through time, showing snapshots of the fall of the Empire, the rise of the Foundation as a new power, how Seldon’s predictive powers do (and occasionally don’t) manage to foresee the different shifts and changes in the galactic sphere. And on that scale, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; still feels like it’s stuck in the earliest stages of what it could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/et-VS8rNQSXH6RtXgr7eC5TvzOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028249/Foundation_Photo_011004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U0BrNx"&gt;In theory, that could all be part of the plan: showrunner David S. Goyer apparently pitched Apple on eight seasons of the series for a total of 80 episodes, which would justify the occasionally dragged-out pace if (and it’s a big &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; actually gets the time and budget to tell the other 87.5 percent of its story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWbRH1"&gt;And if &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; is going to try to forge forward in telling the story of Seldon’s 1,000-year plan, at some point it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; going to have to leave some of its cast and characters behind to forge ahead in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hJIyFs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, and here’s the thing: &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; really does feel like it’s building toward something interesting. But in these 10 episodes, it hasn’t reached that destination yet. It’s more like an extended prologue than its own story. Much like Hari Seldon’s followers, the show demands a lot of faith from viewers. In season 1, you’re investing 10 hours for the promise of a more interesting story to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just provided the perfect example of why you can’t trust App Store review scores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rFx2DPvClVc8nhdFNYoS9B53oYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168316/acastro_210817_4721_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61EF7S"&gt;You pissed off people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630517/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-dashboard"&gt;by somewhat breaking your app&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re leaving angry reviews. How can you salvage your reputation? Apple just found one incredibly effective way — get listeners to submit &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; reviews by interrupting their podcast experience with an in-app prompt to submit a rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4O5ANy"&gt;That’s how the Apple Podcasts app went from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700805/apple-app-store-built-in-ratings-reviews-stars"&gt;publicly embarrassing&lt;/a&gt; 1.8-star score all the way to 4.6 stars in a little over a month without any actual fixes, as developer and App Store watchdog Kosta Eleftheriou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856187595804676"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s still going up: according to &lt;a href="https://appfigures.com/"&gt;AppFigures data&lt;/a&gt;, the app has been getting thousands of ratings every day since November 9th, with the vast, overwhelming majority of them issuing a 5-star score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iEKI5P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;How did “Apple Podcasts” suddenly go from 1.8 to 4.6 stars? Is Apple manipulating their own app ratings now? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bSAr8sFKqQ"&gt;https://t.co/bSAr8sFKqQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5kJKYd54VP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5kJKYd54VP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856187595804676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLSaop"&gt;The app has made it to 4.7 stars overall as of this writing and is firmly the No. 1 App Store search result for “podcast.” It looks far more desirable to a new user than it might have before. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tJ4l36w1J8cs4Ok4ZBg5j-ulUc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028458/app_figures2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppFigures estimates 6,292 five-star ratings were submitted on November 17th alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DZqFVI"&gt;If you think there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for this, you might be right — it could definitely be that people who bother to submit reviews tend to be angry, and a lot of people who love Apple Podcasts and never bothered to look it up in the App Store (remember, it’s preinstalled!) are finally balancing things out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClRKH5"&gt;But do those people &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; love Apple Podcasts? Because if you really look at the reviews, it seems like some funny business is going on. There are new, positive reviews, but they aren’t reviews of the Apple Podcasts app at all — they’re reviews of podcasts themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="omaoOF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All the new positive reviews appear to be talking about specific podcasts, instead of the app: &lt;a href="https://t.co/HCo7WCcmH3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HCo7WCcmH3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856197393772547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5AtQE"&gt;I kid you not — this is the top review for Apple Podcasts on the App Store: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gjlDWMerX2-r8gik_iK5ynV0kk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028402/apple_podcasts_review.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple deems this the “Most Helpful” review of its Podcasts app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mp9WiE"&gt;Here are a few more of the “Most Recent” reviews of the Apple Podcasts app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2mG2cO"&gt;“Amazing show! Hilarious and well researched,” writes SammyAls, adding, “The dynamic is amazing, and the content is SO needed! Love this.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EjOpm8"&gt;“Mobley has Depth and Insight,” writes xbacksideslider. “Nice to listen to thoughtful and factual podcast. Far from the superficial emotional appeals to envy and self congratulating faux empathy that so dominate popular culture.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gtRf9"&gt;“The table,” says Jkimble6091. “Being a future young millionaire listening to Anthony Oneal keeps me on track during all the ups and downs of life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IdJELO"&gt;I wondered if maybe this was a common confusion with podcast apps, where listeners think they’re reviewing a podcast instead of the app itself. But no, I didn’t see that obvious pattern when I checked reviews for other top podcast apps in the App Store. Almost every review on competing apps was a review of the apps themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="095B9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0pSFJU"&gt;Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s using a new prompt but claims it’s nothing out of the ordinary. “With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review just like most third-party apps — using the standard Rating &amp;amp; Review prompt available to all developers,” wrote an Apple spokesperson who only agreed to comment if they were not named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJppJu"&gt;We weren’t able to track down a copy of the prompt ourselves to confirm when and where it appears or what it looks like — which seems important if people are getting confused — but it is indeed &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ratings-and-reviews/"&gt;a standard feature of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, one you can even turn off if you like under Settings &amp;gt; App Store &amp;gt; In-App Ratings &amp;amp; Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6lQcf"&gt;But intentional or not, standard or not, the problem with star scores is there’s no way to tell whether they’re legitimate. We don’t know if someone pressed a five-star button because they loved the app, or thought they were rating the podcast itself, or just wanted to close the prompt as quickly as possible. We don’t know if Apple is prompting everyone, or just its most dedicated fans, or some other algorithmic subset that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528701/apple-rank-own-app-over-competitor-files-dropbox-wwdc-2017"&gt;just happened to give it an advantage&lt;/a&gt;. Some bad actors reportedly even buy star scores for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;their egregious App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s impossible for most App Store shoppers to tell. We’ve even seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;an iOS app that refuses to open unless you give it a good score&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3UShJ"&gt;These are the reasons why I suggested that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;should lead the industry by killing off star ratings for good&lt;/a&gt;, among other things it could do to prove it puts people ahead of profits in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM5ZQS"&gt;But with Apple Podcasts, the company is using the same broken star score system that uplifts scammers for its own benefit as well. And it’s a crystal clear example of why you can’t trust star scores — because everyone knows this was a 1.8-star app just last month &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/users-despair-at-apple-podcasts-app-after-update/"&gt;with many valid lingering complaints&lt;/a&gt;, and nothing’s fundamentally changed. It’s the exact same app today as it was then. &lt;/p&gt;
