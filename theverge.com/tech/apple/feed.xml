    <title>Apple apparently has a spatial audio event right after today’s WWDC keynote</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbWUnT"&gt;Apple appears to have planned a dedicated event on Apple Music’s upcoming spatial audio feature for later today. According to a video that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/06/apple-music-event-june7-after-wwdc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; was uploaded to &lt;em&gt;Apple Music &lt;/em&gt;as a teaser&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;it’s since been removed — Apple will broadcast a special event called “Introducing Spatial Audio.” The event doesn’t appear on the Worldwide Developers Conference schedule but is set for 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzXx0I"&gt;That is, of course, immediately after the presumed conclusion of Apple’s much anticipated 1PM ET keynote to kick off this year’s online WWDC, where the company is expected to announce its annual updates to each of its operating systems. Later in the afternoon at 5PM ET Apple will give its usual “State of the Union” presentation, which is more focused on developers than the opening keynote and addresses various technical aspects of the company’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xvwrXDo5W-2ZX2-IMMxKqj_xOTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642181/apple_music_june_7_post.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwhGpC"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; spatial audio for Apple Music last month alongside the addition of lossless files to the streaming service. Spatial audio will work with AirPods, built-in speakers on Apple devices, and third-party headphones, and should provide more immersive Dolby Atmos mixes compared to regular stereo audio. Apple previously said the feature would launch in June, so a mention of the release date at the WWDC keynote wouldn’t have been surprising, but it seems the company wants to give it a little more time in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple heads into developer conference under more scrutiny than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_f6blu4byEVOq4Ae1XSs1u-Jmo=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69413334/wwdc_scrutiny.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z1fpLh"&gt;Apple needs a distraction, and it needs one fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kv4Hd"&gt;On Monday, the company will hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-wwdc"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt;) during one of the most fraught moments for developer relations in Apple history. While Apple emerged from the Epic v. Apple trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;in a seemingly strong legal position&lt;/a&gt;, its reputation took a body blow. Evidence revealed the company &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;“treat every developer the same”&lt;/a&gt; — it cut special deals with big companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and Hulu and made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;arbitrary&lt;/a&gt;, cutthroat decisions to lock competition out and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;lock users in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zUWB7"&gt;Developers have known or suspected these things for years, and at first, online reactions seemed muted. This is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647249/wwdc-apple-parental-control-app-store-mdm-spotify-moderation-developers-2019"&gt;third year&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;in a row&lt;/a&gt; that the shadow of antitrust regulation has hung over WWDC, after all, and so far the company has largely emerged unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d9ZWem"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“We treat every developer the same.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/BsxsXhMiRB"&gt;https://t.co/BsxsXhMiRB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/XGA2J1hV6b"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XGA2J1hV6b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1390305227174252547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2IBSWl"&gt;But Apple watchers were hearing something else in the company’s testimony during the trial, something even devout developers couldn’t ignore: Apple was building its case on the idea that Apple, &lt;em&gt;not developers&lt;/em&gt;, was solely responsible for the success of the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oObTNI"&gt;Some of those developers are now supremely unhappy. So it would be fortunate if Apple has a new MacBook Pro waiting for them, one that could swing the conversation at WWDC away from difficult questions about whether the App Store is fair.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Marco Arment’s tweets on May 11th slam Apple for shitting on developers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbCNShZc48KHH-OOILMvXMa5YXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22639655/marco_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tweets by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101013243432960" target="_blank"&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;By May 11th, developers had noted the tone of Apple’s testimony &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101013243432960" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;was clear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RKlzG7"&gt;On May 21st, Tim Cook himself made Apple’s position crystal-clear: “I view that we are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Cook told Judge Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, when she questioned whether Apple didn’t necessarily deserve all the credit for keeping users around. Later, Cook insisted Apple would get paid no matter what gets decided in court: “We would have to come up with an alternate way of collecting our commission,” he told the judge, if alternative app payment mechanisms become a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyimkW"&gt;We’ve seen rent-seeking behavior from Apple in the past: remember when it forced Hey, WordPress and others to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;add in-app purchases to their &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; apps&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;were too scared to speak up?&lt;/a&gt; “These apps do not offer in-app purchase — and, consequently, have not contributed any revenue to the App Store over the last eight years,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation#kmmNsE"&gt;the company told&lt;/a&gt; Hey developer Basecamp, as if paying rent was the only value that Basecamp had ever brought to the iPhone. Now, we’re learning that entitled perspective goes all the way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="It7IaP"&gt;I thought Nick Heer &lt;a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/epic-v-apple-ends/"&gt;put it well:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3ErNWV"&gt;If you thought before that Apple was an overly controlling corporate giant that squeezed money at every possible opportunity, its executives’ testimony reinforced that. Even if you are comfortable with Apple’s business case, Tim Cook’s cold remarks must have shaken some of that confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jexU4b"&gt;And this past Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-developers-grow-app-store-ecosystem-billings-and-sales-by-24-percent-in-2020/"&gt;when Apple issued&lt;/a&gt; what his fellow podcast hosts &lt;a href="https://atp.fm/433"&gt;called a “self-serving puff piece,”&lt;/a&gt; prominent iOS developer Marco Arment apparently decided he’d been shaken enough. “[T]o bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple’s feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting,” writes Arment, in a fiery new blog post titled “&lt;a href="https://marco.org/2021/06/03/developer-relations"&gt;Developer relations&lt;/a&gt;” that’s sweeping through Apple’s dev community just days ahead of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5usCD"&gt;“It isn’t the App Store that has enabled all of the commerce on iOS,” Arment challenges Cook: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="c2vDav"&gt;It’s the entire world of computing and modern society, created by a symbiotic ecosystem in which Apple played one part alongside many others. The world was already moving in this direction, and had Apple not played its part, someone else would’ve. The App Store is merely one platform’s forced distribution gateway, “facilitating” the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6iK953"&gt;This is the part where Apple would argue that the App Store is far more — it’s designed to be a safe, curated, trustworthy experience where you can download apps without fear, which takes investment and a lot of work. But as we learned during the trial, the head of Apple’s own FEAR (Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk) team believed that Apple’s App Review program was a joke, “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d3Kgs3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is no one reviewing these apps? Is no one minding the store? This is insane!!!!!!!” - Phil Schiller, 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IjXxPw"&gt;Internal emails also revealed Apple’s own executives couldn’t believe some of the things App Review let into the public sphere, and yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;obvious scams continue to flourish&lt;/a&gt; today. While Apple now says its teams &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/"&gt;stop billions of dollars in fraud&lt;/a&gt; and employ a range of automated tools to detect malicious apps, it also admitted that it only has 500 people reviewing the 1.8 million apps on the store. (500 is not a lot of people to moderate a platform run by the most profitable company in the world, one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;made an estimated $64 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store alone.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVvWJt"&gt;One of Epic’s key arguments during the trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;was that the App Store is &lt;em&gt;ludicrously&lt;/em&gt; profitable&lt;/a&gt;, with margins so high (78 percent) they seem like the “Apple tax” that Apple’s long been accused of creating. And while Apple initially said it would refute that figure during the trial, the company instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business#:~:text=4%5D%20the%20app%20store%20is%20wildly%20profitable%2C%20but%20apple%20won%E2%80%99t%20admit%20it"&gt;repeatedly insisted it didn’t know&lt;/a&gt; how much profit the App Store actually makes. The best it could do was lay out a laundry list of things it doesn’t count against its App Store budget and presumably pays for out of the goodness of its heart, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440629/apple-app-store-physical-purchases-400-billion-50-million-wwdc"&gt;the $50 million a year it spends on WWDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHllMm"&gt;Which brings us to Monday’s developer conference, and how Apple might salvage this mess. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101898191245314"&gt;Like Arment&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t think Apple will suddenly announce that developers can use whichever payment processors they like, or even allow them to steer their customers to ways to pay outside Apple’s ecosystem. There’s also next to no chance Apple will reduce its cut. For one thing, the company’s been &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clear about its stance on each of these throughout the trial, and it’s not going to give up until the lawsuit is over (and even then, not until after rounds of appeals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYHqaG"&gt;Besides, Apple may not feel the need for anything that drastic. While a number of prominent Apple developers and bloggers have gone loud and coverage of the trial may have made Apple slightly less of a media darling — “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/opinion/apple-app-store-fortnite-lawsuit.html"&gt;The Apple Tax is Rotten&lt;/a&gt;,” declared Farhad Manjoo at the New York Times — there are plenty of developers who are simply happy to have a business at all. Having surveyed over 380 software developers ahead of WWDC, Creative Strategies principal analyst Ben Bajarin tells me that smaller developers tend to be satisfied with Apple as a whole, and over 90 percent of developers surveyed so far say they’re likely to keep developing for Apple’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdaBlp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A few observations from preliminary results from our Apple software developers study. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Small developers (those making well less than $1m a year) seem to have much higher positive sentiment toward Apple/App Store than those developers who are larger. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Uk1U5gecUu"&gt;https://t.co/Uk1U5gecUu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenBajarin/status/1400539719490965507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsFxu9"&gt;“There are still pain points, everyone wants Apple to do better, but there’s this demographic that recognizes Apple provides them value, allows them to do the thing they want to do by being a small indie developer,” he says. While many survey respondents complained about the app review process and a lack of clear communication from Apple, and the “vast majority” said Apple could be doing more about scams, even the more vocal developers plan to stay. “You listen to these very vocal developers who are unhappy...  if a viable alternative existed for them, they’d switch, but Apple’s platform and ecosystem is just such a good ecosystem for them. They won’t go to Android, they won’t go to Windows, because they won’t make the same amount of money,” Bajarin says. There’s no viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Agoro"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Where are developers gonna go?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UPdq6M"&gt;Prominent dev&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith"&gt; Steve Troughton-Smith&lt;/a&gt; feels similarly, when I ask him what Apple needs to do this year to win developers over: “the realistic [answer] is ‘nothing’ — where are developers gonna go? They gotta stick with the App Store if they want to make money on mobile, and there really aren’t other options.” He says the majority of developers “don’t know or care about the trial, and they’re happy to build apps within the sandbox that don’t try to push the boundaries or run into existential issues — which is totally fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0Xcyp"&gt;“But I think we’ve lost a decade of innovation at the fringe because of Apple’s nannying, and it gets harder to ignore as Apple is now reaching into apps and trying to dictate their business models,” he adds, referencing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;Apple’s forced in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; as one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo6qqy"&gt;Apple columnist and podcaster &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell"&gt;Jason Snell&lt;/a&gt; agrees that Apple “denigrated their developers” during the trial, but also doesn’t expect them to fix that at WWDC: “Short of changing long-held App Store policies, like allowing linking to web sites for alternate payment methods, I’m not sure what they can do other than power through their next round of OS updates and hope developers get caught up in what’s new and forget what Apple said about the role of third-party developers on the stand,” he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLUj0S"&gt;But I’m betting Apple has another way to take our minds off developer concerns, a plan that’s worked for Apple in the past — a shiny new piece of hardware that’ll make the company’s “pros” excited to work on what’s next. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TwnxEvriVAZ44lI1EUnbjLhKA3A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407714/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A hint at AR glasses, or just someone who likes what they see on this Mac?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dtE24G"&gt;Maybe it’ll be a preview of Apple’s long-awaited AR glasses. That would certainly dominate the headlines and be the talk of the show all week and beyond. While the rumor mill isn’t expecting a product to arrive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;until 2022 at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Cook has been talking up the potential of AR for years, calling it “profound,” “huge,” a “core technology,” “as big an idea as the smartphone,” and most recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;calling the tech “critically important”&lt;/a&gt; to Apple’s future. The company’s own WWDC teaser image above definitely makes me think about augmented reality, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlqpYi"&gt;But a safer bet is that, for the third time in the post-Steve Jobs era, Apple will use WWDC to remind its “pro” users that it knows how to build a Mac at the intersection of power and flexibility. “Can’t innovate anymore, my ass,” said Apple exec Phil Schiller at WWDC 2013, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4412350/apple-new-mac-pro-wwdc-2013"&gt;introducing the radically redesigned cylindrical Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a quote designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4423844/cant-innovate-anymore-my-ass-apple"&gt;to distract from the actual criticism&lt;/a&gt; the company was facing that year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="phil schiller mac pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dui-NzKt5E3I83PJn08iYsvBpuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14361890/Screen_Shot_2013-06-12_at_4.06.55_PM.1419979641.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phil Schiller, announcing the 2013 Mac Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ezcra9"&gt;He also claimed that the 2013 Mac Pro was “without a doubt the future of the pro desktop” and while that turned out to be so embarrassingly wrong that Apple wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission"&gt;publicly admitting that 2013 Mac was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;, the company pulled the same move at WWDC 2019 with its new, improved, and actually-upgradable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/6/5/18652409/apple-mac-pro-design-comparison-cheese-grater-upgrade-old-vs-new-trash-can"&gt;cheese grater Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; to show — once again — that it’s listening to its most vocal audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUaKBv"&gt;2021 gives Apple a new opportunity. Five years ago, Apple killed off the beloved MacBook Pro with Retina Display, trading its pro-friendly SD card slot, full-size HDMI and USB ports and deep, familiar keyboard for a new machine with a gimmicky Touch Bar and a set of USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports that required dongles to plug practically anything into the machine. Developers were disappointed by its lack of RAM, too. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-microsoft-macbook-pro-surface-studio-creative-professionals/"&gt;“Apple’s new MacBook Pro isn’t for pros,”&lt;/a&gt; I wrote at the time. My colleague Vlad: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13548052/the-macbook-pro-lie"&gt;“The MacBook Pro is a lie.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMQywk"&gt;Yet the biggest issue with the new MacBook Pro turned out to be its ultra-thin “butterfly keyboard,” a design so susceptible to dust that it inspired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18284042/apple-macbook-keyboard-apology-issues-bad-design"&gt;its own public apology from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18634932/apple-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-repair-reassure-worrying"&gt;multiple recall / repair programs&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344397/apple-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-switches-defective-class-action-lawsuit-certified"&gt;certified class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. We called it one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/27/21270299/apple-butterfly-keyboard-hardware-design-macbook-pro-physical-key-button"&gt;worst buttons ever made&lt;/a&gt;, and breathed a sigh of relief when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;2019’s MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; phased it out for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vmIX5T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple knows its most important critics love a high-end Mac&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="08e0FQ"&gt;But 2019’s MacBook Pro mostly just fixed 2016’s mistakes — and where pros are concerned, 2020’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s new M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t quite get there. It is essentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt; an M1 MacBook Air with an added fan&lt;/a&gt;, the same two ports and the same maximum 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfHpeV"&gt;At WWDC 2021, Apple can show that it’s listening again, and by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s account, it will: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;we’re expecting to see&lt;/a&gt; a new 16-inch MacBook Pro that brings back the SD card slot and HDMI port, heralds the return of Apple’s beloved trip-friendly MagSafe connector, trades the annoying Touch Bar for physical function keys, and supports up to 64GB of RAM. They’re also expected to include double the high-performance CPU cores and at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; double the GPU cores of the Apple M1 chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;that already managed to upend our concept of laptop performance&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjcOTq"&gt;It sounds like Apple may be giving its professional users exactly what they’ve asked for in a new laptop, for the first time in many years, and many of those pros are the same developers attending WWDC and building for iOS. A shiny distraction won’t help Apple win at trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;or stave off Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt;, but it could certainly help change the tone of developer conversations this week at WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwCoYe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zllFV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees push back against returning to the office in internal letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GCTTu1RK2SvQ48pwnzR5gvDR58E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69409300/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rit5s"&gt;Apple employees are pushing back against a new policy that would require them to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Staff members say they want a flexible approach where those who want to work remote can do so, according to an internal letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FS3kub"&gt;“We would like to take the opportunity to communicate a growing concern among our colleagues,” the letter says. “That Apple’s remote/location-flexible work policy, and the communication around it, have already forced some of our colleagues to quit. Without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; being a part of Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcqkLF"&gt;The move comes just two days after Tim Cook sent out a note to Apple employees saying  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;they would need return to the office on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays&lt;/a&gt; starting in the fall. Most employees can work remotely twice a week. They can also be remote for up to two weeks a year, pending manager approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDz5Y8"&gt;It’s an easing of restrictions compared to Apple’s previous company culture, which famously discouraged employees from working from home prior to the pandemic. Yet it’s still more conservative compared to other tech giants. Both Twitter and Facebook have told employees they can work from home forever, even after the pandemic ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YwWV2X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A clear divide&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iFDei0"&gt;For some Apple workers, the current policy doesn’t go far enough, and shows a clear divide between how Apple executives and employees view remote work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rbKhx"&gt;“Over the last year we often felt not just unheard, but at times actively ignored,” the letter says. “Messages like, ‘we know many of you are eager to reconnect in person with your colleagues back in the office,’ with no messaging acknowledging that there are directly contradictory feelings amongst us feels dismissive and invalidating...It feels like there is a disconnect between how the executive team thinks about remote / location-flexible work and the lived experiences of many of Apple’s employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNhrWZ"&gt;The letter, addressed to Tim Cook, started in a Slack channel for “remote work advocates” which has roughly 2,800 members. About 80 people were involved in writing and editing the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9StMcc"&gt;Apple employees say that embracing remote work is paramount for the company’s diversity and inclusion efforts. “For inclusion and diversity to work, we have to recognize how different we all are, and with those differences, come different needs and different ways to thrive,” they say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gvp6LU"&gt;Here are the specific asks outlined by employees in the note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nSJ0Q8"&gt;We are formally requesting that Apple considers remote and location-flexible work decisions to be as autonomous for a team to decide as are hiring decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDEzWK"&gt;We are formally requesting a company-wide recurring short survey with a clearly structured and transparent communication / feedback process at the company-wide level, organization-wide level, and team-wide level, covering topics listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0J7Kju"&gt;We are formally requesting a question about employee churn due to remote work be added to exit interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAWpbQ"&gt;We are formally requesting a transparent, clear plan of action to accommodate disabilities via onsite, offsite, remote, hybrid, or otherwise location-flexible work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gwYRd"&gt;We are formally requesting insight into the environmental impact of returning to onsite in-person work, and how permanent remote-and-location-flexibility could offset that impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="P3kQoz"&gt;The letter was sent out for Apple employees to sign late Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqGW6r"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fR6ftS"&gt;Read the full letter below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="SHvu9z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10592033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Here’s why you can’t use the Siri Remote’s best feature on Disney Plus and other apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rae05jsZeZ7Xy96tJWJe7bcRUQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408279/DSCF3939.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The redesigned Siri Remote for Apple TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEFtbk"&gt;Apple’s new Siri Remote introduced a gesture that makes it easy to scrub through content by turning the control pad into a scroll wheel. But a number of Apple TV users noticed that the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518296/apple-new-siri-remote-hbo-max-disney-plus"&gt;doesn’t work properly&lt;/a&gt; on some services, like HBO Max, or at all on others, like Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQyWtu"&gt;A spokesperson for Disney Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature — one of the best on the redesigned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; — isn’t supported on its service. It’s not a service issue, though, but instead related to custom video players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2k9Pz"&gt;Some streaming apps available on Apple TV use their own players, while others use the tvOS media player. The jogging gesture works with streaming apps that use Apple’s native media player, but it is not yet supported for third-party developers that use a custom media player, and that includes Disney’s streaming titan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ezjArd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The feature is supported on apps that use the tvOS media player, which Disney Plus does not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KEE18v"&gt;What that means is that beyond just Disney Plus, the scrubbing tool may not work for any video app that uses its own media player. It’s not clear when exactly Apple will make the feature available to these app developers. But the Disney spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Disney Plus does plan to develop the tool for its own service once it does eventually become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wcucg6"&gt;The issue had been the topic of discussion in a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; from user batsforbreakfast21, who noted experiencing issues on Disney Plus but not other services like Netflix and Apple TV Plus. Other users expressed having issues with HBO Max and Peacock as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0ymlh"&gt;Neither Peacock nor HBO Max immediately returned requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI4rcS"&gt;Ideally, the issue will be resolved quickly. Until then, the older and often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;unfairly maligned Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t seem so bad, right? Anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14 basics: how to quit an app on your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fgEerp6jUFsMW4StV7QQVqy-HvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406377/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBAgE4"&gt;Even iOS apps occasionally misbehave — they can crash, or freeze, or otherwise stop working. If you’re new to iOS, or just haven’t had this happen before, you may not know how to actually quit an app (as opposed to just swiping it off your screen). Here’s how to quit an app using iOS 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fFpjG3"&gt;Open the App Switcher by either swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then pausing in the middle, or (if you have a Home button) double pressing the Home button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vYnTbm"&gt;You’ll see an overlapping view of all your open apps. Swipe to the right or left until you find the app you want to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HZCbTg"&gt;Swipe up on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app you want to quit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpaPAZ_gFiuw50kCvgvDaYPH8j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554891/IMG_A27F4BD48743_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe it up to quit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h3_ou0hV4pgpbnjCrn9sFtkrgrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554901/IMG_9FA2A8039FFE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe it up to quit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n10e51"&gt;Unfortunately, there isn’t any way to close all of your apps at once, should you wish to do so — you’ll have to simply swipe them off one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtwsFo"&gt;If for any reason swiping the app off doesn’t solve the problem, then &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/restart-iphone-iph841379c3d/14.0/ios/14.0"&gt;shut down your phone&lt;/a&gt; by pressing and holding the side button and either volume button until you see sliders appear. Drag the one that says “slide to power off” to the right. (If you have an iPhone with a Home button, instead, press and hold the side or the Sleep / Wake button.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLm1Bc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021: iOS 15, new MacBook Pros, and what else to expect</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qq4VZ46b6ppEuSTkzmyvRj8pXY=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405394/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image for WWDC 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrPAza"&gt;Apple’s annual developer extravaganza, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), is coming up fast, kicking off with the keynote presentation on June 7th at 1PM ET. Like last year, WWDC will be an entirely digital and online-only event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the keynote, that means we can likely expect another tightly produced video highlighting everything Apple has in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcZ4wB"&gt;While we aren’t expecting any announcements on the level of Apple’s shift to custom silicon in its computers, which was WWDC 2020’s big news, Apple presumably has some notable changes in the works for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and its other operating systems. And if the current rumors pan out, we could also see brand-new MacBook Pros with the return of some long-missed features, such as MagSafe charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHOWsh"&gt;Read on to learn everything we expect from the big show. And don’t be surprised if Apple has a few surprises in store, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The large FaceID notch is still there, but it eventually feels normal." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9nbJbUEu2WEZNOlTas0gOz9CFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973495/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1kYgB"&gt;iOS 15 may bring improvements to notifications and iMessage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XOV5HQ"&gt;We haven’t heard much about what may be coming to Apple’s next version of its mobile operating system, which will presumably be called iOS 15, but we could see big changes to notifications and possibly iMessage, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGgV0K"&gt;For notifications, you may be able to have different notification settings for situations like driving, working, sleeping, or even a custom category, and you’ll be able to flip those on as you need to. You might also be able to set automatic replies based on which notification setting you’re currently using, like what you can do now with Do Not Disturb while driving mode. Personally, I’m hoping iOS 15 will let me allow notifications from a select few people while silencing just about everything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejmorG"&gt;As for iMessages, Apple is apparently working on features to make it act like “more of a social network” to compete with Facebook’s WhatsApp, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said, but those features are still “early in development” and could be announced at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHBN4P"&gt;Apple also plans to add a feature that shows you apps that are silently collecting data about you, continuing the company’s trend of adding privacy-focused updates to its operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qs0a7Q"&gt;For iPadOS 15, you can apparently expect a major update to the homescreen, including the ability to put widgets anywhere you want. And with Apple just introducing the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1-powered iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;, here’s hoping we see some new upgrades to take advantage of the new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWYOGr"&gt;In May, Apple also announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22457534%2Fapple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a lot of new accessibility features&lt;/a&gt; coming to Apple’s operating systems, such as improvements in iOS to VoiceOver, support for bidirectional hearing aids, a built-in background sounds player, and new Memoji customizations like cochlear implants. Apple said these features would arrive “later this year,” which suggests they’ll be included in iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7c0nD"&gt;We don’t know much about macOS, watchOS 8, and tvOS 15 — but we could see a new “homeOS”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NohEvo"&gt;We haven’t heard all that much about upcoming software updates for the Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, so we’ll just have to wait and see what Apple is cooking up. One tidbit: macOS could be a “more minor” update, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. That wouldn’t be too much of a surprise, given that the macOS operating system got a big overhaul &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;with Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AblZZZ"&gt;However, we could see the introduction of a brand-new operating system called “homeOS,” which was recently mentioned in and later removed from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-homeos-mentioned-in-job-listing/"&gt;an Apple job listing&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s unclear exactly which devices this OS is for, perhaps it will work on Apple’s home-focused products like the Apple TV and HomePod Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6LknsWt_S3FwZjOAtzQTFJeXRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22038534/akramer_201113_4290_0019.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UDG2Pc"&gt;New, redesigned MacBook Pros and a new Apple CPU could be announced&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5KJ6oA"&gt;Apple doesn’t always introduce new hardware at WWDC, but this year, new MacBook Pros seem like a possibility. In a May 18th report, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; that new MacBook Pros might arrive “as soon as early this summer,” which could indicate an announcement at WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QmUJq"&gt;These new laptops would have new Apple-designed processors that would “greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. The M1 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;already pretty dang good&lt;/a&gt;, so it sounds like these new chips could be even more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGX9qI"&gt;Apple is apparently planning on releasing &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; chips for the new Pros. Both should have eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores, while leaving you with the option of either 16 or 32 graphics cores. (By comparison, the M1’s CPU has four high-performance and four energy-efficient cores, while its GPU is offered with either seven or eight cores.) You’ll probably also be able to spec the laptops with as much as 64GB of memory, up from a max of 16GB on M1-equipped computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5MBrI"&gt;The new laptops should be offered with either 14-inch or 16-inch screens and those screens could have “brighter, higher contrast” displays, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;according to a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from January&lt;/a&gt;. The laptops may also have a new design with flat edges as in the iPhone 12, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in January&lt;/a&gt;. I’m curious to see what that design might look like in practice — I worry that the hard edges could be uncomfortable if you have the laptop on your lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OiOCO"&gt;The best rumor is that the new design may also mark the return of some of the ports and features that were taken away with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;now-infamous 2016 MacBook Pro redesign&lt;/a&gt;, including a MagSafe charger, an HDMI port, and an SD card slot, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said in its May report. And, according to Kuo, the OLED Touch Bar currently found on Intel-based MacBook Pros will apparently be removed in favor of physical function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cueoYL"&gt;We could see at least one other new Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr0eKZ"&gt;While it seems like MacBook Pros are the only new hardware we’ll be seeing at WWDC this year, that hasn’t stopped some other Mac rumors from swirling lately, and there’s always the chance Apple could announce more at its big event. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple also has “a revamped MacBook Air, a new low-end MacBook Pro, and an all-new Mac Pro workstation” in the works as well as a “higher-end Mac Mini desktop and larger iMac,” all of which would be powered by Apple’s custom silicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpTzLE"&gt;The new Mac Mini may have the same chip as the new MacBook Pros. The new Mac Pro could be a beast, with processors that are “either twice or four times as powerful as the new high-end MacBook Pro chip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8DBcX"&gt;And the redesigned “higher-end” MacBook Air could arrive as early as the end of this year. Frankly, I hope that refreshed Air arrives even later. I just bought the M1-equipped Air and it’s one of the best computers I’ve ever used, but I have a bad feeling I’ll be first in line to buy a redesigned and more capable Air anyway. (Especially if it gets the MagSafe charger that’s rumored for the new Pros.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SdMhc8"&gt;Apple might have dropped a hint about its AR / VR headset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hWxuz9"&gt;Apple has long been rumored to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;a mixed reality headset in the works&lt;/a&gt;, and recently, we’ve learned a few more potential details about it. The headset might be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; expensive — approximately $3,000, according to one report — though it could be packed with 8K displays, more than a dozen cameras to track hand movements and capture footage, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;might weigh less than an iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbDfpo"&gt;While the headset could be a ways out, as it’s not expected to ship until 2022 at the earliest, a few suspicious details in Apple’s WWDC promotional images &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be hinting toward some kind of reveal of Apple’s upcoming headset or the software on which it runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEwuRw"&gt;Check out this image below (that I also used at the top of this post), which Apple released alongside the announcement of WWDC in March. Notice the way the app icons are reflected in the glasses — I could imagine some sort of mixed reality headset showing icons in front of your eyes in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVsPoR1G837_6LQp6aHbEOLrLa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22549429/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those icons sure are reflected in an interesting spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJi4b2"&gt;Apple continued that reflections motif with new images released in May — you can see things from the laptop screens reflected in all of the eyes of the Memojis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bPEFWi2kCP_J0PT-w7N3kd70zVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22549430/Apple_WWDC21_details_announcement_052421.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at those reflections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xq7x4h"&gt;Now, these reflections may just be Apple’s artists flexing their design chops. And if I had to guess, given how far out a rumored mixed reality headset is, I don’t think we’re going to see anything about it at WWDC this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1tXnv"&gt;But Apple has surprised us in the past, and maybe these images are an indication of one more thing Apple has in store for WWDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SP4Jl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySvSwa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new TV remote is great, but only when apps properly support it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGjeS3jkHTEzIJSHAoxONF76doc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404757/DSCF3948_4.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbNWB6"&gt;Users are complaining that the Disney Plus and HBO Max Apple TV apps aren’t properly supporting the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;. Disney Plus has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;yet to be updated&lt;/a&gt; to make use of the remote’s helpful scroll wheel scrubbing feature, which works on rival Netflix and Apple TV Plus apps. The HBO Max app has more issues, &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and lacks support for several of the remote’s features and voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNBA7o"&gt;When we tried the HBO Max app for ourselves, we found it doesn’t seem to support the new remote’s D-pad. Instead, we could only use the remote’s touchpad circle, which is technically an element of the remote you’re supposed to be able to disable. Scrubbing using the touchpad works, just very badly. The cause of these problems appears to be a recent app update, which replaced the standard tvOS playback UI with HBO’s own (and apparently far less capable) version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBClAz"&gt;It just goes to show that a platform holder can build a powerful combination of hardware and software in support of third-party apps and services, but it doesn’t mean anything unless those same apps and services actually bother to add support. We’ve reached out to both Disney Plus and HBO Max to see if they’re aware of the issues, and to find out when users can expect a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iPad Pro has wireless charging and a glass back: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2021 11-inch iPad Pro. This review has focused a lot on the 12.9, but other than the screen and size the 11-inch is the same." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xD1MZdg_0RBL6JtRDapYh_oyZsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404453/vpavic_210512_4592_0203.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sYmdkN"&gt;Apple is working on a new version of the iPad Pro with wireless charging, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/apple-working-on-ipad-pro-with-wireless-charging-new-ipad-mini"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. To accommodate the technology, Apple will reportedly switch to a glass back for the new models, instead of the aluminum found on the rear of every iPad released so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nmfVk"&gt;Apple is said to be testing a magnetic charging system for the new iPad Pro similar to the MagSafe connector introduced with the iPhone 12 range of phones last year. Apple may also include reverse wireless charging in the new iPad Pro, according to the report, which would allow the iPad to serve as a wireless charging point itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nqHYdc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Editor’s Choice: iPad mini 2019","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18564029/ipad-mini-5th-generation-2019-editors-choice"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I4b119"&gt;Apple only just released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;the new M1 iPad Pro with its Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt;, and the wireless charging model reportedly won’t be ready until next year. However, Bloomberg also says that Apple will release a redesigned iPad Mini in 2021 with narrower screen bezels. It’s not clear whether it’ll switch to Face ID like the iPad Pro or Touch ID on the power button like the iPad Air — Bloomberg’s report only says that “the removal of its home button has also been tested.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7jgAh"&gt;Alongside the new iPad Mini, Apple is also said to be planning to release a thinner version of the 10.2-inch iPad. Both products are likely to be released around the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is updating AirTags to make them less creepy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQ4Ki1"&gt;Apple is distributing an AirTags software update that makes it harder for people to use them for surreptitious tracking, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-bolsters-airtag-privacy-measures-to-offer-android-detector-app-later-this-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. According to a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple is also working on an app for Android users which will let them detect potentially unwanted trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoHH1q"&gt;AirTags were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as Apple’s solution for helping people keep track of everyday objects. In its marketing, Apple shows people finding their lost keys or bags that have the trackers attached. However, there have been concerns the tiny devices are being used to secretly track people without their knowledge, and we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review/"&gt;numerous reports&lt;/a&gt; since the AirTags’ release indicating that some tweaks were needed to make the devices more privacy-conscious for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B1up2"&gt;Before the update, if AirTags were away from their owner, they would chime &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-airtag-privacy-loopholes"&gt;after three days&lt;/a&gt; if they detected that they were moving. If you had a fully up-to-date iPhone, you might get an “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;AirTag Found Moving With You&lt;/a&gt;” notification &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-thing-about-apples-airtags-is-also-the-scaries-1846786338"&gt;before then&lt;/a&gt; — but un-updated iPhone users and Android users were out of luck until that chime. Apple is now updating the AirTags to chime at some point between eight and 24 hours of separation, significantly reducing how long an AirTag can travel before telling on itself. (Apple didn’t respond to request for comment on the range of times it provided.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQlugy"&gt;Apple says the Android app will be coming “later this year” and will be able to detect both AirTags and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;other Find My network accessories&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Chipolo tracker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFtfZW"&gt;Eight to 24 hours is still a long time to be tracked without knowing, but it’s good to see that Apple is at least starting to address some of people’s concerns. The update is out today and should happen automatically when an AirTag comes into proximity with an iPhone similar to how AirPods silently receive updates, according to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
