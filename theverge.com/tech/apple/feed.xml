    <title>Elon Musk says Apple refused a meeting to acquire Tesla </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/beKsBOVlF4bEAhx7gzEvX7Zuzms=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68568801/elon_musk_tesla_3225.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9IUnSd"&gt;Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1341485211209637889"&gt;said Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he wanted to sell Tesla to Apple during the “darkest days” of the Model 3 rollout but that CEO Tim Cook “refused” to take the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDEJ8h"&gt;Musk dished about the proffer in response to a tweet about how Apple has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194032/apple-car-self-driving-battery-tech"&gt;reignited its desire to make and sell an electric, autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt;. He noted that Tesla was worth about one-tenth then what it is now, as the electric vehicle company rounds out a remarkable year where a meteoric stock price run turned it into the most valuable automaker on the planet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pq2LvF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1341485211209637889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L2NSEU"&gt;Musk has previously said that Tesla was “&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/elon-musk-tesla-death-bleeding-cash-a7928b06-3aae-43d7-bdde-5b9c41ef298f.html"&gt;single-digit weeks&lt;/a&gt;” away from collapse in 2017 as he directed all of the company’s resources toward ramping up production of the Model 3 sedan. Tesla ultimately survived, and has since gone on to roll out the Model Y SUV and announce new vehicles like the Cybertruck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpQq9K"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWr5h6"&gt;Apple has spent the last half-decade toying with an entry into the worlds of electric and self-driving cars, but up until this week was thought to be focused on developing software and other technologies that could be sold to other companies. But on Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194032/apple-car-self-driving-battery-tech"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Silicon Valley giant has retrained its focus on making an electric, autonomous car for general consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4lMlA"&gt;One of the reasons Apple reportedly changed directions again is that it has made progress on a potential breakthrough with regards to the battery. According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Apple has been developing a lithium iron phosphate battery that can be packaged more tightly in the car’s battery pack, cutting down on weight while increasing the potential energy density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUokFl"&gt;Musk pointed out on Twitter on Tuesday that Tesla is already using iron phosphate batteries in some of the cars it’s making in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjfwqH"&gt;“Strange, if true,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4IuKM"&gt;Tesla and Apple have swapped a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of talent over the last decade. When rumors of an “Apple car” first emerged in 2015, Musk joked that Apple was a “Tesla graveyard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPidhK"&gt;“If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/8/9484379/elon-musk-blasts-apple-interview"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaQ6B5"&gt;Musk said at the time that an electric car was “the next logical thing” for Cook and Apple to work on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0h7edm"&gt;“It’s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches,” Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2u7sUN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants to build its first car in 2024, Reuters says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yhU4W60hCQ5McMPuRNpxKJYdzMc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562849/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCaIgR"&gt;Apple once again appears to be seriously looking at making a car. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple is pursuing production of a passenger vehicle by 2024 as well as the creation of self-driving systems and a “breakthrough battery technology.” The report is vague on how it all comes together — it’s not clear that all of this tech is going into the first passenger vehicle Apple hopes to make — but it indicates that Apple is considering vehicle production, after previously shutting down plans to make a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co7fxC"&gt;There have been rumors of Apple developing a car going &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-titan-car-project-to-challenge-tesla-1423868072"&gt;back to 2015&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2016, the project was scaled down significantly, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/17/13303710/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-focus"&gt;development of a full car being scrapped&lt;/a&gt; and Apple’s team refocusing on providing software that could be licensed out to car manufacturers, according to reports at the time. Around 200 people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195598/apple-project-titan-200-employees-dismissed"&gt;were laid off&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s car team just last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TZo6Yh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are a lot of vague details still, including whether this will actually happen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4qhcXN"&gt;Now it seems that Apple has renewed its focus on building an actual vehicle — though there’s a lot of uncertainty on when (and even if) it will happen. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;says 2024 is the production goal for an Apple-made passenger vehicle, though it could be pushed back “into 2025 or beyond” because of pandemic-related delays. There is also still a chance Apple could scale its efforts back to just autonomous driving tech, the report warns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHKZEu"&gt;The report says that Apple is relying on third parties to provide some components of its self-driving tech, including its LIDAR systems. Apple’s battery technology reportedly relies on a “monocell” design that allows more capacity to be fit into the overall battery unit by not dividing it up into discrete cells. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports that it could allow for “a potentially longer range” and lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAvXzX"&gt;Apple declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GuZwn"&gt;If Apple is planning to manufacture a self-driving car, it may also face regulatory hurdles before it can hit the road. There are no true self-driving vehicles available today, though some cars, like those from Tesla, offer a degree of advanced driver assistance driving in certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrVaW"&gt;Earlier this month, Apple handed control of its self-driving car project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;over to John Giannandrea&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s head of AI. Giannandrea was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17195076/google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-joining-apple-machine-learning-siri"&gt;brought on board&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 to work on Siri, after previously working at Google as head of search and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzA2Mv"&gt;Just yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/20/sketchy-report-says-apple-car-coming-2021/"&gt;another report&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;em&gt;Economic Daily News&lt;/em&gt; in Taiwan, said that an Apple-made car could be released as soon as 2021 in what would be a stunningly ambitious timeframe if true. Back in 2018, reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted the launch of a car between 2023 and 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/14/ming-chi-kuo-apple-car-2023/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, though, the impression has been that Apple was focused on self-driving technology for the past several years, rather than production of an actual Apple-branded vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe releases Apple Silicon version of Premiere Pro in beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1pSOOnlCu8CTFOf7nfR1F0j2pY=/0x0:749x499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559369/PPro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r6qYc8"&gt;Adobe has released an Arm version of Premiere Pro for macOS, allowing owners of new Apple Silicon M1 Macs to run the video editing software natively. The program is still very much in beta for now, however, and the &lt;a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-beta/discuss-premiere-pro-on-apple-silicon-m1/td-p/11691346?page=1"&gt;Adobe post announcing its availability&lt;/a&gt; lists a host of known bugs and missing features. News of its release was &lt;a href="https://the8-bit.com/adobe-premiere-pro-for-m1-macs-now-available-to-public-beta-testers/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The 8-Bit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/premiere-pro-premiere-rush-audition-for-m1-beta/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; adds&lt;/a&gt; that Adobe’s Premiere Rush and Audition have also been updated to run on the new machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkSxYy"&gt;Adobe says it’s porting Premiere Pro’s features over in phases, starting with its core editing functions and workflows, as well as popular codecs like H.264, HEVC, and ProRes. Third-party integrations will need to be updated by their respective developers to work on Apple Silicon. Adobe advises that users can run the current release version of Premiere Pro on M1 Macs using Rosetta 2 emulation while the Arm version is still in development, though some third-party integrations may not work in this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaQRE2"&gt;Premiere Pro joins other Adobe apps including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571070/adobe-photoshop-arm64-beta-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162930/adobe-lightroom-arm64-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Lightroom&lt;/a&gt; that have seen releases for Apple’s new Arm-based Macs. It’s a relatively quick turnaround for Adobe considering the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini were only released just over a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dozens of Al Jazeera journalists targeted in apparent iOS spyware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CbJr-LdQ9t6mMic2yNHFwEeQFas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559162/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QGHkvY"&gt;36 personal phones belonging to Al Jazeera journalists, producers, anchors, and executives were hacked in a spyware campaign between July and August 2020, &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/"&gt;a new report from Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt; alleges. The attacks reportedly used Pegasus technology provided by the Israeli firm NSO Group, and are thought to be the work of four operators. Citizen Lab says it has “medium confidence” that one is working on behalf of the UAE government and another for the Saudi government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1mZNr"&gt;The attacks are worrying not just because they appear to show politically-motivated targeting of journalists, but also because they’re part of a trend of using increasingly advanced methods that are harder to detect. According to Citizen Lab, the attacks seem to have used a zero-click exploit to compromise iPhones via iMessage, meaning the attacks happened without the victims needing to do anything, and leave much less of a trace once a device is infected. In July 2020, the exploit chain was a zero-day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="b4U0XN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS 14 is not thought to be vulnerable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xl91yS"&gt;Citizen Lab’s report says “almost all iPhone devices” which haven’t been updated to iOS 14 appear to be vulnerable to the hack, meaning the infections it found are likely to be a “miniscule fraction” of the total number. It has disclosed its findings to Apple, and the company is looking into the issue. Citizen Lab’s analysis suggests the spyware can record audio from a phone (including ambient noise and audio from phone calls), take photos, track location, and access passwords. Devices updated to iOS 14 don’t appear to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUvkiT"&gt;Citizen Lab discovered one of the hacks after Al Jazeera journalist, Tamer Almisshal, allowed the organization to install a VPN on his device because he was worried it might have been compromised. Using this software, Citizen Lab, noticed that his phone visited a suspected installation server for NSO Group’s spyware. Seconds later, his phone uploaded over 200MB of data to three IP addresses for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwYgD5"&gt;As well as the Al Jazeera employees, Citizen Lab reports that a journalist with Al Araby TV, Rania Dridi, was also the victim of hacks using NSO Group’s spyware. These attacks date back to October 2019, and appear to include two zero-day exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0MCsi"&gt;This is not the first time allegations have emerged that spyware from NSO Group has been used to target journalists. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/20/citizen-lab-nso-dozens-of-aljazeera-journalists-allegedly-hacked-using-israeli-firm-spyware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the software has allegedly been used to target journalists in Morocco, as well as political dissidents from Rwanda and Spanish politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ewhJZ"&gt;When contacted for comment a spokesperson for NSO Group told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Citizen Lab’s report was based on “speculation” and “lacks any evidence supporting a connection to NSO.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJTXOs"&gt;“NSO provides products that enable governmental law enforcement agencies to tackle serious organized crime and counterterrorism only, and as stated in the past we do not operate them,” the spokesperson said. “However, when we receive credible evidence of misuse with enough information which can enable us to assess such credibility, we take all necessary steps in accordance with our investigation procedure in order to review the allegations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhDZmC"&gt;As a result of its investigation, Citizen Lab is calling for more regulations over the use of surveillance technology, and for a global moratorium on its sale and transfer until safeguards are put in place to guard against its misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Bridgerton, Palmer, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fZShpCHvIFY6ai3whgaN086rHDM=/231x72:1634x1007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68557464/Screen_Shot_2020_12_20_at_1.34.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRK60L"&gt;Hi, I’m Jay! I’m subbing in for your usual trailers guide Kim Lyons while she takes a well-deserved holiday break. I’ve really been looking forward to writing this post. Trailers are fun! They’re like bite-sized movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KY1ma"&gt;Unfortunately, there weren’t a ton of trailers to choose from this week. I suppose studios don’t want to launch big trailers for upcoming blockbusters shortly before everyone takes off for the holidays. But there were still a few good ones to watch, including a trailer for a series launching on Netflix later this week. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="icRUIG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpv7ayf_tyE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q9TbTN"&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XCvNbh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; is Shonda Rhimes’ upcoming British period drama for Netflix, the first series resulting from her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16142342/shonda-rhimes-deal-netflix-greys-anatomy-scandal"&gt;mega-deal with Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like it should hit a lot of the expected high points from a period drama, such as a budding relationship between two people of high society, lots of witty one-liners, and extravagant settings, dancing, and costumes. And I’m sure Rhimes’ influence will make the show all the more exciting. &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; will be released on Netflix on December 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7BExhw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8jVuOheTNGQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j6RMOS"&gt;Palmer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JafKlA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Palmer&lt;/em&gt; stars Justin Timberlake as a man trying to rebuild his life after being in prison. Soon after he returns home, he begins taking care of a small boy, Sam, whose mother has disappeared. The movie looks like it will focus on how the two help each other overcome their difficulties. The movie will be released on January 29th on Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LfOlfO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6sxCFZ8_d84?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bCBwY0"&gt;Nomadland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5yYPf8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; is about a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who hits the road in her van and becomes a nomad. It’s the third movie directed by Chloé Zhao, who also directed &lt;em&gt;Songs My Brothers Taught Me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Rider. &lt;/em&gt;The trailer is beautiful and contemplative — the movie feels like it will be perfect for a quiet night curled up in a blanket. &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; is set for a US theatrical release on February 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v1SxkE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwYhA5YvdNc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BtmiMn"&gt;Outside the Wire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fMhc1x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outside the Wire’s&lt;/em&gt; trailer has lots of athletic jumps, explosions, robots, and loud drumming, so I hope that translates to a fun and campy action movie. (Basically, it seems like the opposite of &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt;.) And Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/only-on-netflix/81074110"&gt;official description for the movie&lt;/a&gt; makes me even more intrigued: “Set in the future, Harp (Damson Idris), a drone pilot, is sent into a deadly militarized zone where he finds himself working for Leo (Anthony Mackie), an android officer, tasked to locate a doomsday device before the insurgents do.” Sweet, I’m in. &lt;em&gt;Outside the Wire&lt;/em&gt; will hit Netflix on January 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OFICxT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SntsSsMLUWA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3cHU9z"&gt;WandaVision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dir6hL"&gt;Disney has also released another short trailer for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming Disney Plus series from Marvel Studios. Elizabeth Olsen stars as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany as Vision. If you’ve been anticipating &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, you won’t have to wait long until you can finally watch it — the show premieres on January 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JI7aQo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFmMCq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNLx7C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wM7igq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jsXF6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just temporarily closed all 53 stores in California and over a dozen in London</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store SoHo STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrGZwPSsEtFW25xPILUVPvG_ylk=/6x0:1020x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68554340/apple-store-soho-stock-logo_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iyFjdG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac’&lt;/em&gt;s Michael Steeber &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelSteeber/status/1340288965841219584"&gt;noticed a interesting coincidence today&lt;/a&gt;: the company has temporarily closed every single retail store in California, many more across the US, both stores in Mexico, both stores in Brazil, and is about to close 16 additional stores across the UK. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/19/apple-retail-stores-closed-holiday-season/"&gt;As Steeber points out&lt;/a&gt;, that’s nearly 100 stores if we include ones it closed in Germany and the Netherlands last week, leaving nearly a fifth of the company’s locations now closed worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceDpeM"&gt;I checked &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fretail%2Fstorelist%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F19%2F22190895%2Fapple-close-retails-stores-covid-19-london-california-pandemic#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s complete list of stores&lt;/a&gt; to confirm, and sure enough: every California store, all four in Tennessee, all three in Utah, all four in Minnesota, two in Oklahoma, and the stores in Portland, Oregon; Anchorage, Alaska; Omaha, Nebraska; and Albuquerque, New Mexico are all closed this upcoming week — as well as the 16 additional stores in the UK, Mexico and Brazil starting tomorrow, December 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DwrbkE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stay home, wear a mask&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bhZgnS"&gt;It’s not hard to guess why the stores are reclosing, particularly in California &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-19/california-coronavirus-record-cases-deaths"&gt;where COVID-19 saw its four deadliest days yet in a row last week&lt;/a&gt; as part of an ongoing surge, and in London where Prime Minister Boris Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-19/london-put-in-emergency-lockdown-as-u-k-fights-new-virus-strain"&gt;has just put the city in emergency lockdown starting midnight&lt;/a&gt;. Apple confirmed the gist&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of it in a statement: “Due to current Covid-19 conditions in some of the communities we serve, we are temporarily closing stores in these areas,” the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-12-19/apple-temporarily-shuts-all-california-stores-as-covid-surges?__twitter_impression=true"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qdDRh"&gt;Yesterday, California activated its emergency alert system in the SF Bay Area for the first time since the pandemic began, sending a message directly to every phone to help people understand that a stay-at-home order is now in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Apple puts another supplier on probation after exploited workers smashed up a building</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4qOySW"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556154/apple-supplier-pegatron-student-labor-violation"&gt;the second time in two months&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is putting one of the companies it hires to build the iPhone on notice for violating labor laws. &lt;em&gt;Reuters, Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and others are reporting that Apple has put Taiwanese manufacturing giant Wistron on “probation” — meaning it won’t receive any new business from Apple until it sorts things out — after the supplier was found exploiting workers at a plant in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krl426"&gt;The reason we’re hearing about this at all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22172383/workers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;is rather incredible&lt;/a&gt;: on December 12th, some 2,000 workers decided to protest unpaid wages by rioting at one of Wistron’s offices, smashing up the lobby and overturning vehicles. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TOIBengaluru/status/1337615298761912321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1337615298761912321%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F13%2F22172383%2Fworkers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;There’s video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7w7lnr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Karnataka: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Violence?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Violence&lt;/a&gt; at iPhone production plant run by Taiwan-based &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wistron?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Wistron&lt;/a&gt; Corp at Narasapura (in Kolar district) near &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bengaluru?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Bengaluru&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Employees allege they have not been paid properly. &lt;a href="https://t.co/GKbeFeyRKc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GKbeFeyRKc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TOI Bengaluru (@TOIBengaluru) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TOIBengaluru/status/1337615298761912321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ib8q0g"&gt;It now turns out that the workers’ complaints were legitimate: &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/indian-iphone-factory-apologizes-to-workers-for-mishandling-wages-11608388075?mod=mhp"&gt;Wistron is admitting as much&lt;/a&gt;, and the local government found serious labor violations in its preliminary investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3114491/wistrons-apple-factory-india-committed-serious-violations"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-india-wistron/apple-supplier-wistron-could-not-manage-scaled-up-india-plant-government-report-says-idUSKBN28T0C9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;They say Wistron was indeed underpaying wages and forcing some people to work overtime. And that’s just Wistron itself. The &lt;em&gt;SCMP &lt;/em&gt;reports police are also investigating middlemen who are targeting Apple’s contract workers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="RITUTM"&gt;There have also been allegations of middlemen exploiting the contract workers and skimming their wages, with police looking into the role of six contractors who acted as go-betweens for Wistron. They reportedly lured workers by promising them an additional allowance if they forewent breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S3BeRM"&gt;The investigation also reportedly reveals that 8,500 of the Wistron factory’s 10,500 workers were contractors rather than full-time employees, and that the plant may have only been permitted for 5,000 workers to begin with. (Wistron started assembling iPhones in India &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15651842/apple-iphone-india-assembling-begun"&gt;back in 2017.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLKjkZ"&gt;Wistron &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chandrarsrikant/status/1340205614484504576"&gt;issued an apology&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it’s “enhancing its processes and restructuring our teams to ensure these issues cannot happen again,” adding that it’s already established “a 24-hour grievance hotline” and “an employee assistant program.” The company says it also sacked its VP of business in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFlr7E"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybNMYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MlkRf"&gt;The question now is whether Apple will do anything meaningful to keep its suppliers from exploiting workers now that they’re making headlines yet again. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/12/8024895/apple-slave-labor-working-conditions-2015"&gt;a notable history of being associated with labor violations&lt;/a&gt;, and a recent report suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;that Apple turns a blind eye to them&lt;/a&gt; even when it knows there’s a problem. Did Apple know about this? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: two new Google antitrust cases and an AirPods Max review </title>

      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xXH0EyRgeu85YDcw4g1bvVtJx0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548235/npatel_201209_4332_0060.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QTMjBY"&gt;It seems like there’s no sign of tech news stopping for the holidays. In &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;s &lt;/em&gt;last regular episode of 2020, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn and Nilay Patel bring on senior reporter Adi Robertson and editor Chris Welch to explain the biggest stories in tech from this past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd5sEh"&gt;In the first half of the show, Adi explains two (!) more antitrust cases brought against Google this week: one from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas attorney general&lt;/a&gt; and the other from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;a coalition of 38 states&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;breaks down their arguments about Google’s alleged anti-competitive behavior around ad tech and search manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2gnAW"&gt;In the second half of the show, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; shift gears to a review of the latest product announcement from Apple: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. Chris reviewed the new $550 headphones for the site, and he details his experience on the show — from comfortability to design and sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaKqS2"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like a privacy debate between Facebook and Apple, some rumors about the next Samsung flagship phones, and the ability to “ProRAW” image capture on the iPhone 12 Pro — so listen through to hear it all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple explains how the AirPods Max conserve battery life — with or without the case</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckRZ6B"&gt;After some initial confusion around how the AirPods Max handle power management, Apple has tried to clarify the issue with &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886"&gt;an updated support page&lt;/a&gt; outlining how and when its new $550 headphones automatically conserve battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyxn56"&gt;Originally, the company said that “when stored in their soft, slim smart case, AirPods Max enter an ultra‑low‑power state that preserves charge.” But there was uncertainty about what happens when they’re left &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the case. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;In my review&lt;/a&gt;, I found that the headphones lost only a few battery percentage points when left out overnight with no case — nothing close to a worrying level of drain. But not everyone had that experience; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvvo6vUpJRc"&gt;Marques Brownlee&lt;/a&gt; observed a greater amount of battery loss when the AirPods Max were idle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgLlfQ"&gt;According to Apple, the AirPods Max enter a “low power mode” when removed from your head and left stationary for five minutes outside of the case. If they’re left in that state for 72 hours, they go into a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; power mode that switches off Bluetooth and features like Apple’s Find My location tracking. This, essentially, sounds like when they actually turn “off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgvvoN"&gt;But somewhat surprisingly, the smart case doesn’t immediately trigger this deeper sleep mode as quickly as I would’ve thought. Inserting the AirPods Max into the case puts them into that lighter low power mode right away. But it takes 18 hours of the headphones being in the smart case for them to enter the ultra-low power mode. When the case is factored in, Apple never mentions that the headphones have to be “stationary” to enter these modes. But the fact that it takes almost an entire 24 hours for the AirPods Max to hit that point where they maximize battery — even in the case — is a bit surprising to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnVW3m"&gt;Clearly, the company is prioritizing quick device reconnections and convenience over eking every last bit of battery out of the AirPods Max. One big question is what happens if the headphones are left worn around your neck when removed; since they’re not stationary in that scenario, my guess is that they remain fully active until taken off and put on a table or stand. It’s possible that Apple could adjust these default behaviors through firmware updates, but for now, this is how the AirPods Max work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18Qv0J"&gt;Even if I’ve seen minimal battery drain, and just as I say in our video review, I still wish they had a power button. For simplicity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
