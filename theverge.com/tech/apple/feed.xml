    <title>Apple is settling a $100 million suit with a major modification to the anti-steering rule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIws0cqrESJtDaW4vTXq-uP4JDM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69781576/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61502r"&gt;As part of a proposed agreement to resolve a class action lawsuit from US app developers which includes a $100 million payout from Apple, the company also says iOS developers will finally be able to contact their customers, with permission, using information collected inside their apps. The change is a shift to the anti-steering policy that has been a big point of contention between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;Apple and its critics for years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TmUqp"&gt;The change, while potentially important for developers, isn’t quite as significant as it may seem. In an update to the App Store Guidelines in June, Apple already changed its rules to allow developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;to communicate with customers outside of their apps&lt;/a&gt;, but at that time, they weren’t allowed to contact users using information obtained inside the app — they would have had to figure out how to obtain their contact info another way. If this proposed agreement is approved, that restriction would no longer be in place, which should make it easier for developers to reach out to users. Still, it’s not what many developers had been asking for: a way to let users know, &lt;em&gt;inside their app, &lt;/em&gt;that they don’t have to pay using Apple’s in-app payment system and incur its up-to-30-percent toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCRkq9"&gt;Apple’s press release spins the entire settlement as a generous offer to developers, including the anti-steering change: “To give developers even more flexibility to reach their customers, Apple is also clarifying that developers can use communications, such as email, to share information about payment methods outside of their iOS app,” &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates/"&gt;the company writes&lt;/a&gt;. “As always, developers will not pay Apple a commission on any purchases taking place outside of their app or the App Store. Users must consent to the communication and have the right to opt out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="auZUu9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is making a number of other concessions as part of the proposed agreement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xiPlG1"&gt;The company is also making a number of other concessions as part of the proposed agreement for &lt;em&gt;Cameron et al v. Apple Inc, &lt;/em&gt;the big one being a payout of $100 million to small developers who earned $1 million or less “for all of their apps in every calendar year in which the developers had an account between June 4, 2015, and April 26, 2021.” Apple has decided to name this the “Small Developer Assistance Fund.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMS3GM"&gt;Other points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MxAvSc"&gt;A promise to keep the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;, which allows developers who earn less than $1 million in a year to apply for a reduced 15 percent commission from their sales, in place in its “current structure” for at least the next three years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UbCuwt"&gt;The company will publish an annual transparency report about the App Store. Apple says the report will include “meaningful statistics about the app review process, including the number of apps rejected for different reasons, the number of customer and developer accounts deactivated, objective data regarding search queries and results, and the number of apps removed from the App Store.” It’s unclear when the first report will be released, but the company is committing to releasing the report for at least three years. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4NMX3q"&gt;Developers will be able to set more than 500 price points for subscriptions, in-app purchases, and paid apps. Right now, they’re limited to fewer than 100, so the jump will allow developers to offer a wider range of prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OLFgtE"&gt;Apple is committing to keep the current App Store Search system in place “for at least the next three years.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1431058415263039488?s=21"&gt;Tapbots developer Paul Haddad points out why&lt;/a&gt; that’s not necessarily what all developers want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JHR0UR"&gt;The company will add an unspecified amount and type of additional information about the app appeals process &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/"&gt;to the App Review website&lt;/a&gt; to “help developers understand how the appeals process works.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="PqSZj7"&gt;The proposed changes come on the heels of another big App Store change announced Thursday: Apple announced that it will take a 15 percent cut of publishers’ in-app purchases and subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642902/apple-news-partner-program-lower-commission"&gt;if they join Apple News&lt;/a&gt; instead of 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OiZ5CU"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AwJklZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 26th, 9:46 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified how, specifically, the anti-steering rule has changed from previously, and other tweaks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will take a smaller cut of publishers’ sales if they join Apple News</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple News on a MacBook and iPhone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VbenwCYxz6C6cERjRNiXJFzkIAc=/95x0:1748x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779318/image__2_.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5e7ktH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-introduces-the-news-partner-program/"&gt;has a new offer for publishers&lt;/a&gt;: join Apple News, and it’ll only take 15 percent out of your in-app purchases and subscriptions instead of 30. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/news-partner/"&gt;Publishers can apply to Apple’s News Partner Program&lt;/a&gt; to take that bargain, but they have to agree to Apple’s requirements, which naturally benefit Apple and go beyond just maintaining a channel in Apple News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAVW3L"&gt;The list of specific eligibility requirements to apply is short but worth sharing in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="re918R"&gt;You must maintain a robust Apple News channel in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and publish all content to that channel in Apple News Format. If you’re based outside of these regions and do not publish in Apple News Format, you must share content via an RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABvMvR"&gt;The primary function of your app must be to deliver original, professionally-authored news content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRF37b"&gt;Your app must be available on the App Store and allow users to purchase auto-renewable subscriptions through Apple’s in-app purchase system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAbIAM"&gt;The Account Holder of an Apple Developer Program membership must agree to a separate addendum to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DVrn3S"&gt;So publishers are expected to maintain their Apple News channel, publish in the Apple News Format (ANF), and offer an app in the App Store that offers auto-renewable subscriptions and only “original, professionally-authored news content.” Apple says the News Partner Program will also support and fund organizations that educate readers on news media literacy and “further efforts to diversify newsrooms and news coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BvrIdQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A dramatic reduction in fees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJq28u"&gt;It’s extra work to maintain an app and publish in an entirely separate, proprietary format, but based on what Apple reportedly asked of publishers in the past, this might be a welcome reprieve. Apple traditionally takes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12774758/apple-developers-app-store-new-subscription-rules"&gt;a 30 percent commission on in-app subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; that drops to 15 percent after a year, but before Apple News launched, rumors suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18222281/apple-news-subscription-service-50-percent-cut-publishers-media-deal"&gt;Apple was asking publishers for 50 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, news publishers weren’t very happy about that, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21378156/apple-news-publishers-subscription-deal-app-store-cut-terms-amazon-letter"&gt;once they found out Amazon got special treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VyJQr"&gt;After the rough treatment, it’s not clear if the News Partner Program will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307242/apple-news-new-york-times-app-not-available-free-articles-subscription"&gt;entice former publishers like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; There’s also the consideration of how this looks considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; in which Apple is currently embroiled in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;and abroad&lt;/a&gt;. But the company hasn’t exactly been one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;to consider the optics of major business shifting decisions&lt;/a&gt; as of late, so maybe it’s hoping publishers won’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Mvb5hj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Apple is making the antitrust case against it stronger ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/17/21292983/apple-spotify-antitrust-hey-email-congress-house-judiciary-tim-cook"},{"title":"What Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook have at stake in the antitrust fight ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="W5xKhC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this article stated Apple wanted publishers to support news media literacy and diversity organizations as part of the News Partner Program. That’s incorrect, Apple will support those efforts. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TSMC is raising chip prices as supply shortages continue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kvgnqWiO5XEvjBrgD26sUwCdosg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69778180/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3nem0m"&gt;TSMC is the biggest chipmaker in the world and the company responsible for the processors used by Apple, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and even some Intel products. And its products are about to get a lot more expensive: the company plans to raise prices of its advanced chips by around 10 percent and less advanced products by about 20 percent, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-shortages-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-higher-prices-are-likely-11624276801?mod=article_inline"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8agsp"&gt;Semiconductor supply has become an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"&gt;increasingly important factor&lt;/a&gt; for major tech and automotive companies, as chips continue to be hard to come by. There are a lot of factors that go into the prices of phones, laptops, and game consoles beyond the actual bill of materials, so a 10 to 20 percent increase in processor and SOC costs may not necessarily correlate to a similar jump in price for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIEeQE"&gt;But raising the prices of what was already one of the most important and expensive components in a device (for example, two of the iPhone 12’s &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-12-bill-of-materials-revealed_id128600"&gt;three most expensive parts&lt;/a&gt; are its Qualcomm modem and A14 SOC) means that we could be headed for price increases on some of the most popular devices in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRfPOM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t specify whether Apple will be hit by TSMC’s price increases or if it will choose to pass those extra costs down to customers if it does see increased chip prices. But TSMC is quite literally the only supplier in the world capable of making chips at the advanced level and volume that Apple needs to make its A-series and M-series chips for its iPhones, Macs, and iPads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiC3QN"&gt;Additionally, Apple CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/apples-iphone-hot-streak-will-run-into-global-chip-shortage.html"&gt;did warn in the company’s last earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that silicon supply constraints could be coming to its upcoming iPhone and iPad products this fall, especially for older, less advanced chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bpb9xU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The shadow of the chip shortage is looming over tech’s big quarter","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VSpjwZ"&gt;The good news is that the raised prices may actually help alleviate some of the supply issues for TSMC by reducing some of the demand that’s been driving the scarcity in parts. It’ll also help TSMC continue to raise money it needs for its ambitious investments in expanding capacity, which include spending $100 billion through 2023 on plans like its $12 billion manufacturing hub in Arizona and other projects. TSMC had previously warned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578361/tsmc-revenue-surge-chip-shortage-continues"&gt;shortages would likely extend into 2022&lt;/a&gt; at its latest quarterly earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Premium subscribers can now turn on picture-in-picture on iPhone — here’s how</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unpHc4LCFhB85ZFP2--7UePeWxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69772479/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VRhHTx"&gt;In June, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540482/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone-ipad-ios-app-free-premium"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be bringing picture-in-picture to iOS. Now, it seems the much-demanded feature is finally available, though perhaps for a limited time only and only for YouTube Premium subscribers currently. Here’s how to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UifLlx"&gt;If you’re a YouTube Premium subscriber, open up a web browser and head to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/new"&gt;www.youtube.com/new&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll down to where “Picture-in-picture on iOS” is listed and click “Try it out.” You’ll be prompted to sign in to your account. Then, while watching a YouTube video, just navigate away from the app using the home button or by swiping up and picture-in-picture will start. Locking your phone screen while watching PiP will pause the video, but you can resume it via the lock screen media controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIjZtyU48d6dZYFmAXgu6GpOa10=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804321/IMG_FAC59AB82AD0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Head to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://www.youtube.com/new" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.youtube.com/new&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to enable the experimental feature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cxDx7V"&gt;We spotted the news &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/24/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which notes that some users have been able to get the feature working on iPads as well as iPhones, but it seems access is a little unpredictable. (Apparently deleting the app might help.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5YpjS"&gt;YouTube says the feature is “Available until 31 Oct,” and we’re not sure what happens after this date. Fingers’ crossed that will be when YouTube — as promised in June — will be bringing the feature to all users, not just paid ones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut. There are often sizable discounts available on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $119 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747976896193620917#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one thing: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $150 or below. Right now, you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747977841356115870#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to as low as $180. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $197 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26%26adid%3D22222222227317608597%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D395477009936%26wl4%3Dpla-834433976587%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D520468661%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwr56IBhAvEiwA1fuqGoJTvXd60Wil7w2NpRvHJQwNPXUkWno3r0nNI2Z3XwNpX4tSWE601RoCuScQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $200 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1122332/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $239&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max have been discounted to under $450 in the past, there are currently few notable sales to speak of. You can, however, pick up a pair at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747975436149246309#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now for $50 off, their typical sale price.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Looking back at a decade without Jobs — Apple’s biggest decade ever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1KA34Z"&gt;On August 24th, 2011 — ten years ago today — Apple co-founder Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/8/25/2383755/steve-jobs-resigns-as-apple-ceo-replaced-by-tim-cook-jobs-takes"&gt;resigned as CEO&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-brand/apple-usurps-google-as-worlds-most-valuable-brand-idUSTRE74800D20110509"&gt;newly minted&lt;/a&gt; most valuable brand in the hands of his successor Tim Cook. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/8/25/2383755/steve-jobs-resigns-as-apple-ceo-replaced-by-tim-cook-jobs-takes"&gt;Just six weeks later&lt;/a&gt;, Jobs died. Needless to say, Cook had some big shoes to fill: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/08/25/steve-jobs-apples-ceo-retrospective-products"&gt;Jobs is remembered&lt;/a&gt; as the visionary CEO and marketer behind the Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod, iTunes, and the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="444Mz3"&gt;A decade later, what has Tim Cook built?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OOOyqG"&gt;The most valuable and profitable company in the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uREFDS"&gt;Apple is bigger than oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fX5KWq"&gt;A company that turns a web of complex components into sophisticated computing devices now makes more money than those that effectively pump barrels of cash out of the ground. And it’s because Tim Cook meticulously crafted the overseas supply chains to make it so, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/29/2910338/tim-cook-china-foxconn-zhengzhou-factory-visit"&gt;contracting manufacturers like Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; which employ hundreds of thousands of Chinese laborers for Apple’s production lines, and delivering a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/apple-price-hikes-and-services-growth-produced-a-42point5percent-gross-margin.html#:~:text=Apple's%2038%25%20gross%20margin%20was,certain%20as%20death%20and%20taxes.&amp;amp;text=In%20its%20quarterly%20earnings%20report,%2C%20the%20figure%20was%2040%25."&gt;remarkably steady gross margin&lt;/a&gt; for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/09/apple-pips-exxon-as-worlds-biggest-company"&gt;In August 2011&lt;/a&gt;, shortly before Jobs stepped down, Apple had already briefly passed Exxon to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, on the back of Tim Cook’s efforts as COO and interim CEO. Even in 2019, when Saudi Arabia opened up state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco for trading, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;it didn’t dominate for long&lt;/a&gt;: Apple surpassed it last July on its way to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;$2 trillion market cap&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple is approaching $2.5 trillion now. It’s more profitable than Saudi Aramco, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bwuafe"&gt;By any metric imaginable, Tim Cook has grown Apple into a behemoth over the past decade. Revenues reached a record $111 billion this holiday season, &lt;em&gt;quadruple&lt;/em&gt; what the company saw the same quarter in 2011. Profits more than quadrupled from $6B in Q1 2011 to $28.8B in Q1 2021. The company holds nearly $200 billion in cash, more than double &lt;a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0729/Apple-cash-on-hand-76-billion.-US-Treasury-74-billion"&gt;the already-staggering $76 billion&lt;/a&gt; it had in 2011, and Apple has more than doubled in size with 147,000 full-time employees — compared to 60,400 the year Jobs stepped down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVt7jh"&gt;As of June 2021, Apple now makes an average of $10,000 &lt;em&gt;every second&lt;/em&gt;, $3,600 of which is pure profit. How long ago did you start reading this story? Chances are Apple grossed half a million dollars by the time you finish this sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9wCXJ1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple first quarter revenue:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Q1 2021: $111.4 billion &lt;br&gt;Q1 2020 $91.8 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2019 $84.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2018 $88.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2017  $78.4 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2016  $75.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2015  $74.6 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2014  $57.6 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2013 $54.5 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2012 $46.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2011  $26.7 billion&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1354544947127603201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQBNui"&gt;All of these numbers reflect how Cook’s Apple relentlessly pumped out premium products that consumers were eager to buy, steadily improving them year by year, at a pace Jobs’ Apple never did. Between 2013 and 2018, Apple sold more iPhones &lt;em&gt;every single year&lt;/em&gt; than it did during the five years Jobs was in charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbqS8w"&gt;For some, the dollar signs alone are proof Cook has been a complete success. If you spent $1,000 on Apple stock the week Steve Jobs stepped down, it’d be worth nearly $11,000 today, not including dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kr24C0"&gt;But measuring Apple by financial performance alone is only half the story. If you were hoping Cook would be a Jobs-esque product visionary, you probably haven’t been quite as impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FdasIY"&gt;Hardware swings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OQzIu9"&gt;As the venerable tech journalist Walt Mossberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026112/apple-tim-cook-iphone-watch-tv-decade-blockbusters-walt-mossberg"&gt;wrote for us two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Cook’s Apple has yet to produce a truly game-changing hardware product — nothing on the scale of the iPhone, iPad, or Mac. The biggest new Apple products under Tim Cook are either iPhone accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, or products his Apple delivered because they were what customers were asking for — like iPhones with larger screens. “Steve was pretty adamant that big phones aren’t something we’re going to do,” says tech analyst and former Apple marketing director Michael Gartenberg, noting it was part of the discussion around the iPhone 6 Plus launch in 2014. “Tim said consumers want it, we’ve got the capability to do it, so we’re going to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOzDOB"&gt;But there have also been some surprisingly public failures, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;the unceremoniously canceled AirPower charging pad&lt;/a&gt;, the difficult-to-upgrade Mac Pro that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"&gt;Apple admitted&lt;/a&gt; was a mistake, and most of all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;the shameful five-year saga&lt;/a&gt; where Apple’s flagship MacBook laptops had keyboards that just couldn’t be trusted not to break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple iPhone 6 Plus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTJTeQw4Q7EadQ6r8cmLsXtGOcI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/797122/DSCF1788-2040.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6 Plus came with a 5.5-inch screen, compared to 4- and 3.5-inch screens on previous devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Macbook with Retina Display hands-on photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nqAefnJebZoae2_Ubp7h-PASKo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3486508/DSC06543.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s dust-intolerant butterfly keyboards were first introduced in its 12-inch MacBook in 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s8cNuR"&gt;And whether he was chasing Steve Jobs’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2012/7/12/3151491/fighting-words-apple-post-pc-microsoft-pc-plus"&gt;notion of a post-PC world&lt;/a&gt; or attacking it on his own terms, Cook’s Apple spent years focused on the iPad at the expense of the Mac, only to discover it was alienating some of its most important fans: the Apple developers it relied on to create iPhone and iPad apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyYyUd"&gt;(It’s particularly egregious when you consider that 2013 Mac Pro and 2016 MacBook Pro were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4412350/apple-new-mac-pro-wwdc-2013"&gt;supposed to be Apple’s &lt;em&gt;answers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the idea it’d abandoned Mac power users.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9FFBW"&gt;The Apple Watch is now a hit product in a category of one, as Google and others continue flailing to compete. But part of the Apple Watch’s success is simply how expectations lower over time. When it was announced in late 2014 as Cook’s first big new product, it &lt;a href="http://watch-apples-most-personal-device-ever/"&gt;was explicitly introduced&lt;/a&gt; as a product innovation on par with the Mac, iPod, and iPhone, with its digital crown touted as “Apple’s most revolutionary navigation tool since the iPod Click Wheel and iPhone Multi-Touch.” The pitch was that it could change your life by changing your health — and that it was a luxury product, too, with an 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition variant starting at $10,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NOoMk"&gt;But Apple had to reboot the entire Watch interface and ditch the ultra-luxury versions before finally finding its footing with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;the Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. Even now, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"&gt;not a lot of evidence&lt;/a&gt; it’s meaningfully improving people’s health, aside from the occasional &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-watch-lifesaving-health-features-read-5-peoples-stories/"&gt;anecdotal reports&lt;/a&gt; about people whose watches detected a fall or a heart rate spike in time to save their life. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TjrwlP"&gt;Apple’s AirPods, its second big wearable product under Cook, are also a smash hit. But in many ways, AirPods are symbolic of the entire Cook era, where a seemingly obvious idea, executed at scale and tied tightly to the iPhone, becomes not only a business but also a cultural success. “It’s that process, that continued refinement of Apple, that has been Tim Cook’s genius,” says Gartenberg, pointing out how Cook’s Apple also did the seemingly impossible by transitioning the Mac away from Intel processors practically overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVZCZd"&gt;While it’s too early to tell, the M1 chip may go down as one of Cook’s biggest swings: his Apple channeled the company’s relentless efforts to improve its Arm-based iPhone processors year after year after year into a new M1 laptop chip that blew away the skeptics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;upending our entire concept of laptop performance&lt;/a&gt;. Jobs may have bought P.A. Semi in 2008 to reduce the company’s reliance on partners to power the iPhone, but by 2011 Apple hadn’t yet introduced its own CPU cores inside an Apple A-series chip, much less its own graphics. Cook’s Apple made it happen, and Cook took a victory lap this April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/20/22394756/apple-tim-cook-mission-impossible-heist-action-movie-stunt-lasers"&gt;by adding the new M1 chip into the iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3arxXhPSmHQTGpoozfYbnBaHBXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458386/tim_cook_spy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim Cook smiles in a Mission: Impossible-esque marketing video where he infiltrates Apple to plant an M1 chip in the iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VckANs"&gt;Still, both the AirPods and Watch have fundamentally been accessories for the iPhone, not new computing platforms in their own right: standalone Watch apps have not become a booming market. Cook’s biggest promises have mostly yet to pan out: he spent a year after Jobs’ death talking about Apple’s TV efforts, only to totally start over with the Apple TV Plus streaming service. He’s repeatedly said Apple’s greatest contribution to the world &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/tim-cook-teases-new-apple-services-tied-to-health-care.html"&gt;would be in health&lt;/a&gt;, with the Watch and the Peloton-like Fitness Plus platform the small beginnings of that effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mPH0j"&gt;And while Cook has teased for half a decade that augmented reality might become a new platform — calling it “a big idea like the smartphone,” “profound,” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;“critically important” to Apple’s future&lt;/a&gt; — it’s largely just been teasers. Very little has come of ARKit, which brought basic augmented reality apps to the iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16329366/ios-11-apple-arkit-best-new-ar-apps"&gt;since its 2017 debut&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple’s rumored AR headset has — if understandably — been a year or two away &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/27/17291964/apple-vr-ar-headset-report"&gt;for the last three years in a row&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p4rApd"&gt;The services turn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lqjmoz"&gt;If Tim Cook stepped down from Apple tomorrow, though, analysts wouldn’t be asking if a product visionary will take his place — they’d be wondering whether the next CEO will continue turning Apple into a services company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6PPhT"&gt;In the second quarter of 2016, Cook and Apple CFO Luca Maestri drew financial analysts’ attention to a remarkable fact it had quietly been disclosing for well over a year — Apple was becoming a services company, too. The App Store and the company’s other paid subscriptions were accelerating quarter over quarter and year over year — and they had raked in $4.8 billion in Q1 2015 &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt;. In 2017, after pulling in over $7 billion per quarter for three fiscal quarters in a row, Apple declared its services business was the size of a Fortune 100 company all by itself. Last quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21_Q3_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf"&gt;Apple saw a record $17.5 billion in services revenue&lt;/a&gt;, nearly half the size of the iPhone and more than double any other hardware category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D4FSqQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s services business eclipsed the Mac and iPad years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUgNc5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;As emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; (#10) revealed, the App Store alone had already eclipsed the company’s entire Mac and iPad businesses in 2016, with only the iPhone towering above it. Add movies, music, books, magazines, paid iCloud storage plans, AppleCare, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, Apple News Plus, and Apple Fitness Plus, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;you’ve got a wide array of services collectively pulling in billions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41rcor"&gt;It’s not clear which of these make a dent beyond the App Store, as Apple stopped talking about Apple Music’s paid subscribers after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761603/apple-music-60-million-subscribers-eddy-cue-spotify"&gt;it hit 60 million in June 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the company still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394404/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-july-2021-ted-lasso-second-season-timing"&gt;effectively gives away Apple TV Plus for free&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3NcAu"&gt;But Cook’s sights are set beyond content services, too: with Apple Pay, the Apple Card, Apple Cash, and the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575852/apple-pay-later-report-affirm-paypal-klarna-monthly-installments"&gt;Apple Pay Later&lt;/a&gt;, the company seems to be edging into banking as well, locking in a cut of your transactions at the same time it’s locking you into its software ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eSusHKkETOnKHF0qDJKLjVLYKVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803090/apple_card.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m07x0x"&gt;There is one place that Cook’s Apple admirably won’t go: while some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22526881/apple-icloud-plus-privacy-subscription-services-revenue-wwdc-2021"&gt;Apple’s service upsells&lt;/a&gt; can be highly annoying, Cook has been a champion for user privacy, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9437717/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-car-npr-interview"&gt;calling it “a fundamental human right,”&lt;/a&gt; and famously fighting the FBI over requests that, privacy advocates agreed, might lead to governments having backdoors into users’ phones. It’s the rare tech giant that isn’t using your data as a revenue stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzNlcV"&gt;Some of Apple’s services play goes back to the days of Steve Jobs. One year before he died, he delivered an internal strategy presentation where he declared 2011 the “Year of the Cloud,” and that Apple should “tie all of our products together, so we further lock customers into our ecosystem.” But the majority of Apple’s services today were introduced on Tim Cook’s watch, and Apple Pay in particular should go down as one of the company’s game changing moves — while other phone makers do have a direct equivalent, it was Cook’s Apple that drove instant, seamless, touchless payments across large parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LF4zDI"&gt;Growing pains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SpOXfI"&gt;The question now is whether Apple can keep up with its all-encompassing pursuit of growth, because after a decade some cracks are beginning to show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOIjYE"&gt;Consumers, competitors, and lawmakers around the world are starting to treat Apple like just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"&gt;another giant company trying to extract revenue&lt;/a&gt; any way it can — and as the company has become responsible for a billion devices and 2 million apps, its reputation is starting to take some brutal body blows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb9cLL"&gt;Apple has never apologized so much as it has in the past few years, whether it’s for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;artificially slowing down older iPhones&lt;/a&gt; to preserve their batteries, secretly having human contractors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836760/apple-apology-siri-audio-recordings-privacy-changes-contractors"&gt;listen to Siri recordings&lt;/a&gt;, or backing away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;forcing a developer to add in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3N79cVD7GA5P1VFHwJMpbBiMZJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13670433/appleprivacy_vsavov2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s “What happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone,” one of many privacy ads the company created.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LWRwsS"&gt;Even as Tim Cook continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282158/apple-services-privacy-credit-card-tv-data-sharing"&gt;push Apple as a privacy company&lt;/a&gt;, where what happens on your phone stays on your phone, Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;grappling with the reality of child porn&lt;/a&gt; and making potentially worrying privacy concessions as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4FVY8"&gt;The company’s embroiled in lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny around the globe alleging the App Store is a monopoly, and while it’s entirely uncertain whether judges will agree, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;Apple’s own internal emails&lt;/a&gt; do a pretty good job of showing how the company values lock-in and favors some developers over others, despite Tim Cook’s testimony under oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wasIlc"&gt;Even as Apple tries to maintain the image of a technological leader that puts people first, the company has deployed an army of lobbyists to kill regulation it opposes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia"&gt;in California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22357121/arizona-hb2005-app-store-bill-dead-apple-google-big-tech-lobbying"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, Louisiana, and Georgia — where Apple &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/20/apple-takes-on-state-legislatures-georgia-506299"&gt;reportedly threatened to pull its investment from a historically Black college&lt;/a&gt; if a challenge to its App Store went through. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/technology/apple-google-south-korea-app-store.html"&gt;asked the Biden administration to pressure the South Korean government&lt;/a&gt; from enacting a similar law. Even as Apple projects an image of its App Store as a trustworthy place to shop, it’s become increasingly obvious that its 500 human reviewers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;don’t have time to catch the most egregious scams&lt;/a&gt; successfully bilking users out of millions of dollars, even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;emails show&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s been aware of the problem for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpwKLQ"&gt;Cook’s all-important supply chains have consistently been under fire, too, with reports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;that Apple turned a blind eye&lt;/a&gt; to labor law violations in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tEM7mK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple employees are organizing, now under the banner #AppleToo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"},{"title":"Apple isn’t just a walled garden, it’s a carrier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d6dZ8Z"&gt;Although Apple prides itself on a culture of secrecy, it’s currently undergoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a wave of employee activism that might change that culture forever&lt;/a&gt; in ways beyond Cook’s control — although the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;may be illegally trying&lt;/a&gt; to control it anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zqKNr"&gt;And even though Tim Cook has touted diversity for many years, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/30/7133103/thank-you-tim-cook"&gt;deserves credit&lt;/a&gt; for coming out as the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/"&gt;Apple’s own leadership page&lt;/a&gt; is still &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="I8TABB"&gt;It’s possible Tim Cook won’t be the one to solve these problems. He’s been with the company for 23 years, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;he recently told Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; he probably won’t still be there after another decade has passed. But few of them were problems in the Steve Jobs era: many are a function of the Apple that Tim Cook built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OSf1Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lVALy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Apple Maps users are getting the ability to rate places and add their own photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67lhjtovfqRPKE0O5WbrOpYqTx0=/0x138:1125x888/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769463/Image_from_iOS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BV4ZwY"&gt;Apple Maps’ built-in ratings and photos system is rolling out to the US and Canada, letting users add their own information to points of interest on the map (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/23/apple-maps-native-review-feature-us-users/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The system uses a thumbs up / thumbs down rating, and currently exists alongside Apple Maps’ existing integrations like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="40viqo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10715914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ltg8GS"&gt;According to Apple, the feature started rolling out in the US and Canada on Monday, so there aren’t many places that have ratings yet. However, an Apple spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature launched with iOS 14 and has been available in other countries like Japan or Australia for some time. That makes it possible to see how they show up by looking at point of interest cards abroad, where we can see the number of ratings and what percentage of them are positive for the location overall, as well as for any specific amenities that users rated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image showing the product card for Apple’s Ginza store. Included is a label saying 21 ratings, with a thumbs up icon and a label that reads 95 percent. There’s also thumbs up / thumbs down buttons, and breakdowns for customer service and products ratings, both with a thumbs up icon and percentage label." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2ZVmZkfsn0sFGYeaem16dFlzcI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801638/IMG_2305.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Ginza store in Tokyo has solid ratings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9jN6Py"&gt;According to Apple’s introduction screen for the feature, Maps will suggest contributions for you based on your device’s location history, as well as photos in your photos library (the analysis for which Apple says happens on-device). Your name also &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/08/23/apple-maps-ratings-and-photos-feature-debuts-in-us"&gt;doesn't appear to be publicly linked&lt;/a&gt; to the ratings you provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Odr7"&gt;So far, the ratings and photos system is rudimentary — you’re not able to leave any written feedback, and the app is still pulling photos, reviews, and ratings from other sources like Yelp or Tripadvisor. However, it does seem like Apple could be laying the groundwork here for a Google Maps-like system with data provided by Apple Maps users instead of being pulled in from other sources. If Apple does go that route, it could be bad news for Yelp, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/26/21401031/yelp-competition-google-stoppelman-interview-basecamp-epic-apple"&gt;already competing with Google’s user reviews and photos in search results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrPBvL"&gt;Ratings aren’t the only user-generated information Apple’s added to maps — it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275558/apple-maps-beta-accident-speed-trap-reporting"&gt;added the ability to report accidents, hazards, and speed checks&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fios-14-5-offers-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch-diverse-siri-voices-and-more%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22638723%2Fapple-maps-ratings-photos-us-rollout-ios-yelp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="Samsung Frame TV 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpVgcsh0R4DUKmVc_yF-9anmN-8=/0x1005:4194x3801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768188/2018_2_The_Frame_Lifestyle_Image_Assets_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Frame camouflages itself as wall art when you’re not using it as a TV. | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aofzh8"&gt;The Frame, Samsung’s HDR-compatible QLED that pulls double duty as wall art, is one of the more unique TV designs that didn’t die in the concept phase or on the showroom floor of CES. Designed to look like a framed and matted photograph, the 120Hz screen hides in plain sight when switched to an Art Mode that displays still imagery instead of a black void when turned off. It’s a stunner of a TV in many ways and, for a limited time, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927639433300823#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are offering the 55-inch model for $200 off, the second-lowest price we’ve seen this year on the high-tech piece of home decor. It’s the perfect way to convince your friends you’re a person of culture and refinement while still being a techie nerd who loves large screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="StEUzN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZNP6n"&gt;If you use the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro and want a more laptop-like experience, there are deals for both the previous-gen and newly revised Apple Magic Keyboards. Functionally the same, both Magic Keyboards augment the work and play capabilities of the iPad Pro with a quality trackpad and tactile keyboard that folds up to protect the screen. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927298996490402#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; currently has the older model for $199 (a discount of $150) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-iPad-Pro-12-9-inch/dp/B09327XWMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has the newer one for $324 (a discount of $25). The main difference between the two? The updated Magic Keyboard more adequately accommodates the slightly thicker dimensions of this year’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

The newer model might be more convenient and include a few additional enhancements, but with the previous model you’ll get slightly higher resolution capture and 24/7 recording without ever having to worry about charging it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="tulrmO"&gt;Aside from its drones, DJI is most known for its expertise with gyros and stabilizers in the world of gimbals. The DJI OM 4 is its latest-gen mobile gimbal, and it allows for rock-solid stability when shooting videos with a smartphone. The OM4 normally sells for $149, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-OM-Handheld-Smartphone-Stabilizer/dp/B08CMVGVQY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1582634-REG%2Fdji_cp_os_00000108_01_osmo_mobile_4_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22637841%2Fsamsung-frame-tv-apple-ipad-keyboard-nest-doorbell-dji-om4-gimbal-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; both have it for $20 off. Pairing this three-axis stabilizer and mini tripod with an iPhone or Android device that captures 4K video can enhance any vlogging or amateur YouTube setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="2P5Url"&gt;While the Sony A7III camera with kit lens saw a discount last week, you can now save on just the body.

&lt;li id="FCeewS"&gt;The Razer Nari Essential is a great wireless gaming headset that gets the key basics down, while offering up added features like 7.1 surround and spatial audio.

    <title>A guide to platform fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XyTj24P6kioSYNC-lI2mpiPCQGI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67438682/VRG_ILLO_4687_A_guide_to_platform_fees.7.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The hidden costs behind your favorite apps, games, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iNHwd8"&gt;Online marketplaces like Etsy and Apple’s App Store allow businesses to flourish by connecting them to huge, global audiences. But these marketplaces are big businesses themselves, and in order to earn a profit, they take a cut of revenue from many of the other companies that use their space. It leads to a constant tension: apps like Tinder and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t be nearly the phenomena they are today without the App Store, but they have to constantly pay Apple for that privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOSXIP"&gt;Apps are just one example of how online platforms for small businesses and independent creators have shifted the world we live and work in. Membership platforms, like Patreon, allow creatives to charge monthly payments in exchange for new videos, comics, and essays. Video services like Twitch and YouTube allow creators to monetize their time through advertising revenue. And marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon allow people to sell an assortment of products directly to customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5flZWs"&gt;The cut each platform takes varies significantly: Apple notoriously takes 30 percent of many digital in-app purchases; Twitch takes a 50 percent cut of subscription fees and a cut of advertising; eBay asks people to buy space and then pay a fee.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Knowing just how much each platform takes is crucial to figuring out what’s best for your business, or for understanding how the businesses you’re shopping from make money. Here are the various fees each platform takes, divided into four categories: app stores, creator platforms (including memberships, video services, and more), digital marketplaces, and games marketplaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="da0jpB"&gt;App stores&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="kzShWw"&gt;App stores are where an enormous number of businesses operate. Whether someone is selling a line of jewelry on Etsy or spending oodles of money in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, app stores are the gateway to reaching people who shop on their phones and computers. Approximately 80 percent of Americans shop online, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-shopping-and-e-commerce/"&gt;according to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, and more than half of those shoppers use a mobile device like a phone or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwHDdJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple App Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases of digital goods and services; sales of physical products are exempt. Subscription commission falls to 15 percent after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYKQp1"&gt;Developers that make less than $1 million per year in App Store sales can receive 15 percent commission through &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1628805769807344&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0P0P5jBkjzYy3mt-xf5cP3"&gt;Apple’s App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they qualify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjDxJ4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases of digital goods and services; sales of physical products are exempt. Subscription commission falls to 15 percent after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foAtEv"&gt;Google takes 15 percent in fees on developers’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;first $1 million in Play Store revenue&lt;/a&gt; every year. After the $1 million threshold, the rate goes back up to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXAXaL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission &lt;a href="https://seller.samsungapps.com/help/termsAndConditions.as"&gt;on purchases through the app store&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be negotiated with Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBcY1h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon App Store: &lt;/strong&gt;30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases. Subscription commission is 20 percent on video apps and 30 percent on everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjo4FI"&gt;Developers that make less than $1 million per year in app store revenue can receive a 20 percent commission and 10 percent in “promotional credits” for Amazon Web Services through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537726/amazon-app-store-cut-revenue-1-million-80-20-10"&gt;Amazon’s Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcVW3E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 15 percent commission on apps and 12 percent commission on PC games starting August 1st, 2021. A 30 percent commission on all apps, games, and in-app purchases on Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsmi77"&gt;Non-game sellers can also &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1628805769796035&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2pcTZw9XK5Y0m1YuGgSipt"&gt;use their own payment system&lt;/a&gt; and avoid Microsoft’s commission entirely as of July 28th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="qZw43L"&gt;Creator platforms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="SgT0wL"&gt;While app stores largely fit into the logic of their real-life, physical counterparts, an ever-growing breed of creator platforms allows people to monetize their personality and creativity more directly. Whether glued on to an existing social network like Facebook or reinventing old forms of entertainment like Clubhouse, creator platforms have found familiar ways to earn a buck on the backs of creator popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kw9kde"&gt;Membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pUePjZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patreon:&lt;/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing"&gt;three types of plans&lt;/a&gt; creators can enroll in, and each plan comes with a different cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aKTu7G"&gt;Lite plan: Patreon takes 5 percent &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xdqpTH"&gt;Pro plan: Patreon takes 8 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="27Ahq9"&gt;Premium plan: Patreon takes 12 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4mMLwm"&gt;The tiers are geared toward different types of creators and businesses. The pro tier lets a creator offer tiered memberships to fans, while the premium tier provides a dedicated contact at Patreon who can provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7bsBU"&gt;Then, there are payment processing fees. For creators in the United States, Patreon takes 5 percent plus 10 cents for payments of $3 or less. Payments over $3 result in a 2.9 percent cut plus 30 cents going to Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1g66UD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OnlyFans: &lt;/strong&gt;OnlyFans takes 20 percent of subscription fees and other earnings, like tips. Creators can set their subscription fees between $5 and $50 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxLgHH"&gt;Tips &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/help/2/14/55"&gt;max out at $100&lt;/a&gt; for new users and go up to $200 for users who have had an account for four months or longer. You can tip $500 per day as a new user, with the limit increasing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kl0STG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter: &lt;/strong&gt;Twitter offers an array of ways for creators to make money. Super Follows &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/super-follows-creator#sfstatus"&gt;allows creators to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; of $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month in exchange for perks like exclusive tweets. &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed-faq"&gt;Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt; allow creators to charge for access to live audio events, with ticket prices ranging anywhere from $1 to $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmwxFS"&gt;For both products, Twitter takes a 3 percent commission on payments (after payment processing and in-app purchase fees, such as Apple’s 30 percent cut) until creators earn their first $50,000 on the platform, after which Twitter takes 20 percent. The features are only available to select users for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fREbo7"&gt;Creators can also &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tip-jar"&gt;receive money directly&lt;/a&gt; through Twitter’s Tip Jar feature, which is currently in beta and only available to some users. Twitter doesn’t take a cut, but payments are subject to the processing fees of whatever third-party payment service is linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRIGoN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook: &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/646162679132229?id=558489708108283"&gt;lets creators offer monthly Fan Subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; and receive support directly from their followers. Facebook plans to take up to a 30 percent cut each month, but the company has announced it won’t be taking any fees until 2023. Apple and Google do take their typical cut on mobile, though, reducing creators’ share to 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZpksF"&gt;Facebook also offers &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/903272529876480?id=648321075955172"&gt;a tipping feature for livestreams called Stars&lt;/a&gt; — basically its answer to Twitch’s Bits. Creators get 1 cent per star, but (like Twitch below) viewers buy them for more than a penny each. If a viewer is buying only a few dollars at a time, Facebook might take upward of 18 percent of the money spent on tips. Creators also need to meet &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/understand-monetization-eligibility-status"&gt;Facebook’s eligibility requirements&lt;/a&gt; to enable Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhjJ7q"&gt;Bulletin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555957/facebook-bulletin-newsletter-subscriptions-substack-competitor"&gt;Facebook’s newsletter product&lt;/a&gt;, currently doesn’t take a cut of subscriptions, though Facebook has so far limited the platform to a select group of higher-profile writers and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tAXPLP"&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WwLzwg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube: &lt;/strong&gt;Creators primarily make money on YouTube through ad revenue. YouTube takes 45 percent of revenue from ads and gives creators 55 percent, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/youtube-standardizes-ad-revenue-split-for-all-partners-but-offers-upside-potential-1200786223/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuzLo7"&gt;YouTube also has a number of ways for creators to get paid directly by viewers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9MnA3"&gt;The platform lets channels offer memberships, which are &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9355861?p=cm_internationalpricing&amp;amp;visit_id=637360435699211837-3596854631&amp;amp;rd=1"&gt;monthly subscriptions that run between $1 and $100&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePlvW1"&gt;Similar to several Twitch features, YouTube’s Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Super Thanks features give fans the ability to tip creators in exchange for perks like better comment placement in a livestream chat, custom stickers, and animations. Prices range from $1 to $500 for pinned Super Chat comments, $1 to $50 for Super Stickers, and $2 to $50 for Super Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEWAAi"&gt;YouTube takes 30 percent of the revenue earned on memberships and Super features once taxes and applicable app store fees are deducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtIxX"&gt;Creators can also sell merchandise from select retailers directly to subscribers via the merch shelf underneath videos. YouTube doesn’t take a cut of merch sales, but creators may be subject to different fees depending on which of the 31 different supported retailers they partner with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3CbSp"&gt;YouTube also shares revenue from YouTube Premium subscriptions based on the amount subscribers watch a creator’s videos. The company has not disclosed how that money is divided, but YouTube tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; most of the revenue from Premium goes to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cvnha"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitch: &lt;/strong&gt;A creator can start making money from ads, subscriptions, and donations once they become a Twitch affiliate, which takes a certain amount of streaming and followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOlblB"&gt;Twitch typically takes 50 percent of subscription fees. Subscription pricing varies by country to reflect the local cost of living. As an example, a base subscription is $4.99 per month in the US but around $1.20 per month in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUmXvX"&gt;Twitch also offers streamers a way to be paid via donations using a virtual currency called bits. Twitch pays creators 1 cent per bit, so after receiving 100 bits, a streamer gets $1. The catch is, viewers pay extra up front to buy those bits: 100 bits costs $1.40 to buy on the web, or around $2 to buy on mobile to account for app store fees. That means anywhere from 29 percent to 50 percent of money spent toward tipping is being lost to fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZwiB0"&gt;Streamers frequently accept donations through third-party payment platforms, too. Twitch doesn’t take a cut of these, but the platforms themselves may come with their own &lt;a href="https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/twitch-donate-button-online-donations/"&gt;deductions for payment processing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX1J8T"&gt;On top of subscriber fees, streamers also earn ad revenue — usually around $3.50 for every 1,000 views of an ad on their channel. For both subscriptions and advertising, bigger streamers may get better deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BAgG9v"&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rnekUT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse: &lt;/strong&gt; Live social audio app Clubhouse allows listeners &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/introducing-payments"&gt;to pay creators directly&lt;/a&gt; via a “Send Money” button. Clubhouse doesn’t take a cut of the payments, and the person leaving the tip is asked to cover the payment processing fee from Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Z3Y4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify: &lt;/strong&gt;Through its subsidiary Anchor, Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/"&gt;allows podcasters to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify won’t take a cut until 2023, after which the company will charge a 5 percent commission. Creators have to cover payment processing fees out of their share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEvz7v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price"&gt;Subscriptions in Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are subject to the same rules as other subscriptions on Apple platforms: there’s a 30 percent commission to start, but if subscribers stick around for a year, the commission drops to 15 percent. Creators also have to pay $19.99 per year to offer subscriptions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNFQOj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discord: &lt;/strong&gt;Through its live audio feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22431438/discord-stage-channel-discovery-social-audio-threads-logo-clyde"&gt;Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;, Discord offers creators the ability to sell tickets to their audio events. The feature is currently in a limited beta, and Discord hasn’t announced if it will keep a portion of ticket sales or when the feature will be available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l1Hn6e"&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rsWmOU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumblr: &lt;/strong&gt;A subscription feature, called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586765/tumblr-subscription-blogs-post-plus"&gt;Post Plus&lt;/a&gt;, lets creators offer subscriber-only posts for $3.99, $5.99, or $9.99 per month. Tumblr takes a 5 percent commission on subscription fees, and for subscriptions made through iOS or Android, creators will lose an additional 30 percent to the respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L56CvI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack: &lt;/strong&gt;The newsletter platform takes &lt;a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037607131-How-much-does-Substack-cost-"&gt;10 percent of subscription fees&lt;/a&gt;. Substack lets writers choose how much they want to charge newsletter subscribers per month or year. (There’s also a free tier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHh9N7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wattpad: &lt;/strong&gt;Fiction publishing platform Wattpad offers a limited form of monetization for certain creators. &lt;a href="https://support.wattpad.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022692911-Paid-Stories-Program"&gt;Invite-only Paid Stories&lt;/a&gt; allows fans to purchase coins to unlock entries in an ongoing story or novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ARgg"&gt;Currently, Wattpad sells coins in several different packages (you can get nine coins for 99 cents, for example) and chapters are usually priced at three coins each (though some go for more). Wattpad says writers receive the “majority of the revenue from the program,” but it has not publicly disclosed the exact split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tas7Ql"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Vella: &lt;/strong&gt;Amazon has its own take on Wattpad’s Paid Stories, &lt;a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G5TFR9WSHB46ZKFN"&gt;called Kindle Vella&lt;/a&gt;. Writers who publish with Vella receive royalties based on the number of tokens spent on an “episode” in their story, with token cost determined by the episode’s length (one token per 100 words). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RFCNQ"&gt;Writers get to keep half of whatever a reader spent on the tokens they used to unlock their story, minus taxes and fees. The complicating factor is that Amazon offers tokens at different price points — you can buy 200 tokens for $1.99 or 1,100 tokens for $9.99 — so payouts can vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq6k84"&gt;At those price points, for example, a writer who receives 100 tokens would either get $1 or 90 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Dvhlsk"&gt;Digital marketplaces&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="aekChA"&gt;Digital marketplaces for physical goods are at the core of online shopping. Many of us use Amazon on a daily or weekly basis, or peruse eBay at work to keep an eye on the latest auctions. But while large businesses can be built on these platforms, their terms can be complicated to navigate and tend to ensure the platforms make a cut on just about every sale that goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ca9l9t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook and Instagram:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook collects either 5 percent per shipment of products sold (one order can include multiple shipments if items are mailed separately), or a flat fee of 40 cents for shipments of $8 or less. This covers taxes, payment processing fees, and applies to all checkout transactions on both Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYoJCi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/223030991929920?id=533228987210412"&gt;Facebook is waiving the selling fee&lt;/a&gt; for all orders shipping through June 30th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWvS6P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon is a complicated one. First, &lt;a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html?ref_=sdus_soa_wic_n#selling-plans"&gt;businesses can choose&lt;/a&gt; between using a professional selling plan, which costs $39.99 a month, or an individual seller’s plan, which has no monthly fee. Those on the professional tier do not have to pay a sales fee on items sold, while those on an individual seller’s plan pay $1 per sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Jqm4G"&gt;Amazon then takes a commission on each sale, including shipping fees. This fee depends on what the item is, typically ranging from 8 to 20 percent. There’s also a $1.80 closing fee for products listed under media categories, including books, DVDs, music, game consoles, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGMlxp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Etsy:&lt;/strong&gt; Etsy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsell%3Fref%3Dftr&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21445923%2Fplatform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;charges a 20-cent fee&lt;/a&gt; for people to list each item for sale. Then, for every product sold, Etsy takes a 5 percent transaction fee, and a payment processing fee of 3 percent plus 25 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FDHHi"&gt;The company also runs an advertising program that’s somewhat controversial with sellers. Etsy pays to advertise their products on sites like Google, and then takes up to a 15 percent fee (but no more than $100) if they lead to a sale. Small sellers can opt out, but larger sellers have to participate; for them, Etsy only takes a 12 percent referral fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDJv8F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally speaking, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Ffees-and-features.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21445923%2Fplatform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay sellers might pay a small fee&lt;/a&gt; to list a product and a 12.5 percent commission on the sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kIY9Z"&gt;Fees can vary significantly depending on product category and listing type, though. eBay also offers paid premium store features that can reduce fees. It’s a fairly complicated series of options — you can get a sense of some possibilities for paying stores from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/run-your-store/subscriptions-and-fees.html#m22_tb_a2__2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_21209964__t_w__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="8EauQs"&gt;Games marketplaces&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="im3fHn"&gt;From a single developer to a huge studio, being on Steam or in the PlayStation store is a big deal for distribution. These giant marketplaces are also key businesses for the companies that run them, often meaning steep fees on sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjp36I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam:&lt;/strong&gt; Steam takes &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/1697191267930157838?content_only=true"&gt;30 percent of all sales&lt;/a&gt; made until the first $10 million. That cut becomes 25 percent when a developer sells between $10 million and $50 million. For every sale after the first $50 million, Steam only takes a 20 percent cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="No2ULR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic:&lt;/strong&gt; Epic takes 12 percent of the revenue from all games sold, giving developers 88 percent. Epic CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1120441795010338816?s=20"&gt;Tim Sweeney tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that of the 12 percent Epic collects, the company nets about 5 percent as profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtIZnS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PlayStation:&lt;/strong&gt; Sony is reported to take a 30 percent cut from games sold in the PlayStation Store, though the split isn’t publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNvkLf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xbox:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft &lt;a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4OG2b"&gt;takes a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; from all games and in-game purchases sold through the console’s store under its standard developer agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMZpzT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itch.io&lt;/strong&gt;: Itch.io takes &lt;a href="https://itch.io/updates/introducing-open-revenue-sharing"&gt;a radical approach&lt;/a&gt; to how it handles its revenue share with its independent creators. By default, the platform takes 10 percent of each transaction before payment providers take their cut. But if creators choose, as part of Itch’s open revenue sharing, they can lower that cut to zero or raise it to as high as 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nofJy8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 24th, 2021, 9AM ET:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published in September 2020; it has been updated and expanded for 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden reportedly hosting cybersecurity meeting with Tim Cook, Satya Nadella, and Andy Jassy attending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At 2019 Dreamforce Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_ns6qHpSM2ZQEkHxNJqcg898cE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69766544/1183490754.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p03RW0"&gt;President Joe Biden plans to host a meeting on Wednesday to discuss how companies are improving cybersecurity after the waves of recent security breaches and ransomware attacks, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy will be attending, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/apple-s-cook-microsoft-s-nadella-plan-to-visit-white-house?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Google, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, and the energy firm Southern Company have also been invited, and Southern Company CEO Tom Fanning is also set to attend, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYxElX"&gt;While it’s not clear exactly what the president and any attendees plan to discuss, there will surely be a lot to talk about given incidents like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;massive Solarwinds hack&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22564054/ransomware-revil-kaseya-coop"&gt;Kaseya ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;the Colonial Pipeline shutdown&lt;/a&gt; resulting from a cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isr1jL"&gt;Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, IBM, JPMorgan, and Southern Company all declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg,&lt;/em&gt; and a Southern Company spokesperson declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The other companies and the White House have not replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
