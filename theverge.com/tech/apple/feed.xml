    <title>Apple faces yet another class action suit over throttling iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3nt9kNdn25Rhi3ZkCv7y2VgOJk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716942/acastro_170731_1777_0002_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OF3kxJ"&gt;A consumer advocacy group in Europe has filed the latest class action lawsuit against Apple saying the company intentionally throttled older iPhones in Italy. First reported by &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/apple-hit-with-another-european-class-action-over-throttled-iphones/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the new lawsuit seeks €60 million (roughly $73 million) in compensation — or about €60 per device — for owners of iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, and 6S Plus models sold in Italy between 2014 and 2020. Euroconsumers, an umbrella advocacy organization in the EU that includes Italy’s Altroconsumo, says the €60 compensation is the average amount consumers paid to replace their devices’ batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpCdG1"&gt;“When consumers buy Apple iPhones, they expect sustainable quality products. Unfortunately, that is not what happened with the iPhone 6 series” Els Bruggeman, head of policy and enforcement at Euroconsumers, said in a statement. “Not only were consumers defrauded, and did they have to face frustration and financial harm, from an environmental point of view it is also utterly irresponsible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPl1GT"&gt;Euroconsumers filed two similar lawsuits in December on behalf of member orgs Test-Achats in Belgium and OCU in Spain. The group said &lt;a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/iapmw8ie3ije/4zMgaeXbZ5sZEqwiSNyVck/dea9914bb631761645b034b120ec7f9f/Euroconsumers_Class_Action_Apple_-_Italy_.pdf"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt; that it plans a fourth lawsuit in Portugal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="va2i0t"&gt;“We have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,” an Apple spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vKW3C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161271/apple-settlement-500-million-throttling-batterygate-class-action-lawsuit"&gt;Apple agreed to a $500 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; in the US last March, after it admitted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16800058/apple-iphone-slow-fix-battery-life-capacity"&gt;slowing down older iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. It compensated consumers who bought an iPhone 6 or 7, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16806582/apple-battery-slowdown-science"&gt;were throttled to preserve battery life&lt;/a&gt;. The case grew out of the tech giant’s “Batterygate” controversy, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology"&gt;iPhone users discovered in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that iOS limited processor speeds as iPhone batteries aged. Apple didn’t reveal to consumers that the feature — meant to address problems with phones’ performance — existed. Users said if they had known about the slowdown feature they would have simply replaced the battery rather than buying an all-new phone, as many did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xgwRv"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/18/apple-fine-battery/"&gt;agreed to a second settlement&lt;/a&gt; in November — this time, with 34 US states —for an additional $113 million. The state attorneys general said Apple “fully understood” that by concealing the intentional slowing down of older phones, the company could profit from people buying new phones rather than replacing the batteries. Apple did not admit to any of the allegations in that settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbRVAT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 25th, 10:45AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Apple spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgAxZd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkCOjt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-896" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730426167398815626" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. Currently, the lowest price is $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730426265427578073" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If those deals sell out, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$220 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730426359423842282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$235 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Microsoft mocks Apple’s doomed Touch Bar in new Surface ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MacBook Pro with Touch Bar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIsq-yfyxJcKdG89pJLVxOMEZD8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716065/jbareham_161111_1263_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W2671R"&gt;Microsoft has a habit of reigniting the Mac vs. PC conflict for its Surface ads, and this time it’s going after Apple’s Touch Bar. In a new TV commercial, aired during Sunday night’s NFL championship games, Microsoft pits Apple’s MacBook Pro against the company’s Surface Pro 7. It’s a chance for Microsoft to mock Apple’s Touch Bar in a TV commercial for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gjmpR"&gt;“Mac gave me this little bar, but why can’t they just give me a whole touchscreen?” asks a boy comparing the two laptops. That’s something that some MacBook Pro users have been calling for, or just the removal of the Touch Bar altogether. Apple is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;reportedly planning a redesign for the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; later this year, with the Touch Bar rumored to be replaced by physical function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ac5d4c"&gt;Elsewhere in the ad, Microsoft tries to position the Surface Pro 7 as a gaming device. “It is a much better gaming device,” claims the ad, which is an unusual way to frame Microsoft’s popular Surface device. The Surface Pro 7 is barely capable of running the latest PC games at acceptable frame rates with its integrated Intel graphics, so it’s not the biggest selling point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Z2E20"&gt;Microsoft has previously compared its Surface Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/11/5990217/mac-vs-pc-surface-pro-3-ads"&gt;to the MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, bashed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/29/12688554/microsoft-surface-pro-4-ad-mac-vs-pc-cat-for-your-hat"&gt;Macs in general&lt;/a&gt;, and found a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/7/31/20749394/microsoft-mac-vs-pc-ad-mac-book-apple"&gt;guy named Mac Book&lt;/a&gt; to tell people to get a Surface Laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUJj90"&gt;This latest ad also focuses on the older Surface Pro 7, which has now been replaced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218445/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-features-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro 7 Plus for businesses and schools&lt;/a&gt; at least. The new model includes a bigger battery, Intel’s 11th Gen processors, a removable SSD, and LTE. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says ‘configuration change’ caused some users to be logged out unexpectedly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uu9-u1akqu5slelV3WZ3gJVNbF4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68710197/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23eKMK"&gt;Facebook says some users were logged out of their accounts unexpectedly Friday due to a “configuration change,” and the issue has been fixed as of Saturday morning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plFk08"&gt;“On January 22, a configuration change caused some people to be logged out of their Facebook accounts. We investigated the issue and fixed it for everyone earlier today. We’re sorry for the inconvenience,” a Facebook company spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZK6SVO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So Facebook, heard it was a "configuration change".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    to the engineers who fixed the issue and patiently tried to explain the cause to us to no avail. &lt;a href="https://t.co/AUARhCZ7W2"&gt;https://t.co/AUARhCZ7W2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook App (@facebookapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/facebookapp/status/1352950739249762305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ieW16K"&gt;The problems began late Friday ET, with users on the r/Facebook Reddit board &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/l346n3/did_anyone_else_get_prompted_to_sign_in_again_to/"&gt;reporting they were receiving “sign in” prompts&lt;/a&gt; from their Facebook apps, but they had not signed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeirJE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-iphone-outage-logout-061740231.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt; found that iPhone users&lt;/a&gt; appeared most affected by the log-out issue, noting that users of Facebook’s iOS app were having difficulty logging back into their accounts when using two-factor authentication. Most were able to log back in, but the authentication codes needed were taking a long time to reach users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5aDYW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pros will reportedly bring back the SD card slot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display 2015" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8U4fJCiw3vwAPazZYBy2f1EbU0=/0x0:1016x677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68705924/oo04-09_1247tt.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vXsdDT"&gt;Apple may finally be bringing an integrated SD card slot to its upcoming 2021 models of its MacBook Pro laptops, according to a new report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot?sref=kKj7hWAI&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, in a move that would restore the popular port standard to the company’s computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVEfNJ"&gt;The MacBook Pro lineup hasn’t offered an SD card slot since Apple removed the feature in its 2016 redesign, which excised all the ports from the laptops in favor of four universal USB-C ports. This forced many professional users — who rely on the popular memory card format to import photos and videos to their computers for editing — to turn to much-reviled dongles to get the same functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAP3av"&gt;The news comes after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;earlier report&lt;/a&gt; from Gurman that originally detailed some of the changes that Apple was planning for the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch designs. These changes include removing the controversial Touch Bar interface in exchange for physical function keys; offering a more squared-off design that’s in line with the recent iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPhone 12 lineups; adding brighter displays; and bringing back Apple’s magnetic MagSafe chargers. That’s all in addition to the biggest change, which will see the high-end laptops move from Intel’s processors to a more powerful version of Apple’s in-house, ARM-based M1 chipset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vREWBe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"2021 MacBook Pro will ditch the Touch Bar and bring back MagSafe, say reports","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"},{"title":"Apple reportedly planning new MacBook Air design with MagSafe charging","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="weImFK"&gt;Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo corroborated those reports by claiming that the new laptops would offer additional ports, but today marks the first confirmation of the SD card slot specifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfF7Bc"&gt;The news of the SD card slot’s return actually comes as an aside in a larger report on Apple’s planned refresh for a “high-end” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;MacBook Air model&lt;/a&gt;, which is said to offer similar MagSafe and processor benefits as the new MacBook Pros. Unfortunately, though, there’s no mention of the SD card slot being offered on the upcoming Air refresh — just a pair of USB-C ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwyZTq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s DeathAdder V2 Pro wireless gaming mouse just got its first big price cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tJCuS69yYlt9KF75D0wTm5xMkIY=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68705173/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_h22_hc4_9086248124446_deathadderV2pro_gallery_1500x1000_img2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j3JQCV"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 wired gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;one of the best wired gaming mice you can buy right now&lt;/a&gt;, according to my colleague Cameron Faulkner. But if you are trying to minimize the number of cables on your desk, the DeathAdder V2 Pro is a nice wireless alternative — and it’s down to $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Gaming-Mouse-Programmable/dp/B08FQMBKQG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5062c6215cf5ff9fc9d97360e8b5047d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730147301464983468" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gMltV"&gt;The DeathAdder V2 Pro is a lightweight mouse weighing in at 88 grams, six grams heavier than its wired variant. It has the same support for five onboard profiles and the same 20K optical sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s7bmwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDBGio"&gt;If you don’t mind wired gaming mice and you are on a budget, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Viper-Ultralight-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B084RPZD6T/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=454c32c001a53e36c40f324f24ec24dd&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730147565467715283" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have also discounted the Razer Viper Mini, bringing it down to just $20. It’s a miniature rehash of Razer’s Viper gaming mouse. It can last for up to 50 million clicks, can handle up to 8,500 DPI sensitivity, and has six programmable buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ymYrPN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10297311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14JBAd"&gt;Apple’s flagship wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are considered worthy of their $249 price tag. However, there are a few deals going on right now. First, you can get a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729136281790037757" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Geek Squad Certified refurbished pair for $200 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, if you prefer buying a new pair, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-22?ref=mwj_cd_deal_8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot currently has the AirPods Pro for $205&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. It’s not the lowest price we have seen a new pair of these earbuds go for, but it is the best price currently available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z9uMA5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxnuBn"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new smartphone that has a superb camera, but you don’t want to spend a ton of money, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615542-REG%2Fgoogle_ga1296_us_pixel_3_xl_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F22%2F22244069%2Frazer-deathadder-v2-pro-wireless-gaming-mouse-airpods-pros-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H still has an incredible deal&lt;/a&gt; on a 64GB unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL. Although this phone is almost three years old, it does come equipped with Android 11 OS and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;will also receive Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, which is coming later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly planning new MacBook Air design with MagSafe charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D2gbftf04MsZI6kpThQ1b1Vyc1w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68704385/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QUN2SW"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a new design for its MacBook Air that will include the return of MagSafe charging. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot?sref=kKj7hWAI&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the updated MacBook Air may appear later this year or in 2022, and is designed to be thinner and lighter than the existing model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yue8s1"&gt;Apple may make the MacBook Air smaller thanks to reduced bezels on the 13-inch screen, and will reportedly include two USB 4 ports on the laptop. Apple is also likely to include the next generation of its ARM-based processors inside this new MacBook Air, after introducing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 on the existing MacBook Air in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="magsafe" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fvHcNKNA1whFI0fAzzNQeqq6SN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/920708/2012-01-25magsafe.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old MagSafe charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I2Umeo"&gt;Apple’s magnetic charging system, MagSafe, is also supposed to return with this MacBook Air redesign. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-macbook-pros-with-magsafe-return-in-the-works"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the updated MagSafe for the MacBook Pro will be similar to the old pill-shaped design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxLIGF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also notes that Apple did consider a larger 15-inch version of the MacBook Air, but has scrapped those plans. This new MacBook Air design is reportedly a “higher-end version” of the existing laptop, and Apple is expected to continue selling the M1 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYY9YJ"&gt;Rumors of a new MacBook Air design come just a week after TF International Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;Apple is also planning a major MacBook Pro redesign&lt;/a&gt; with squared-off sides like the iPad Pro. Apple is also rumored to be bringing back its MagSafe magnetic charging connector to the MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pebble founder promises iMessage on Android and Windows with universal chat app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1wZFTB046HpKA-ZWB_QfputIBo=/0x0:1715x1143/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698998/msedge_cx5MYIw6nR.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beeper’s website promises “a single app to chat on iMessage, WhatsApp, and 13 other networks.”&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: BeeperHQ.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vJaaDX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.beeperhq.com/"&gt;Beeper&lt;/a&gt; is a new universal chat app that’s an attempt to unify 15 different chat platforms into a single interface. The app is the work of a team that includes Eric Migicovsky, the CEO and founder of former smartwatch manufacturer Pebble, who announced its launch on Twitter. Beeper’s site notes that the project was previously known as NovaChat, and requires a $10 per month subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3OMhW"&gt;Although Beeper integrates with world’s most popular messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Slack, Twitter, Discord, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger, it’s the support for Apple’s iMessage that’s perhaps most interesting. iMessage is only officially available on Apple devices, and it’s often cited by users as something that prevents them switching to Android. Migicovsky says Beeper should allow iMessage to work on Android, Windows, and Linux, but admits that it’s “using some trickery” in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7mXgX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And yes, iMessage works even on Android, Windows and Linux using some trickery :)&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1351932357201154048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glUzzv"&gt;An FAQ on Beeper’s website gives a more in-depth explanation of exactly what this trickery involves. If you’ve got an always-online Mac, then you can install the Beeper Mac app to act as a bridge, similar to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/02/imessages-on-android/"&gt;the approach AirMessage uses&lt;/a&gt;. But things get really wild if you don’t have access to a Mac, at which point Beeper says it’ll literally send each of its users a “Jailbroken iPhone with the Beeper app installed” in order to act as a bridge. At this point we should probably mention that using Beeper involves paying a $10 a month subscription, which may or may not include the cost of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5nS9e"&gt;Just in case you thought Beeper was joking, in a followup tweet, Migicovsky said that he currently has 50 old iPhone 4S’s at his desk, ready to be upcycled for use with Beeper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DZqpVf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fQ960gU7Xm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fQ960gU7Xm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1351936829017083906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zcLez"&gt;If the workaround works as Beeper claims, then the result should be a universal chat app that works across MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android, offering a unified inbox, and the ability to search across messages from each of the 15 services. It’s built on the open source Matrix messaging protocol (Migicovsky &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad#315f:~:text=The%20only%20downside%20to%20Matrix%20is,the%20waiting%20list%20to%20use%20it."&gt;previously described&lt;/a&gt; NovaChat’s relationship to Matrix as akin to Gmail’s relationship with email), and although the client app itself isn’t open source, the bridges connecting it to other chat services are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbZT0G"&gt;Oh, and there’s a dark mode coming in Beeper’s next update, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3taZS3X_tQWFDqp5nn7mbulfSZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249728/6006a93e8082353374b0cd22_beeperSearch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeper&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beeper’s interface can include chats from multiple different services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W4JSXX"&gt;While the short-term aim is to make it easier to chat to people across different chat apps, eventually Migicovsky has talked about the prospect of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad#e362:~:text=These%20bridges%20are%20actually%20just%20an,need%20for%20bridges%20gradually%20over%20time."&gt;everyone using Matrix itself&lt;/a&gt; to chat with friends and colleagues, rather than simply using it as a bridge between services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOpjih"&gt;Although Migicovsky says he’s been using Beeper as his default chat client for the past two years, it doesn’t appear to be widely available just yet. Instead, Beeper asks prospective users to fill out a form on its website for an invitation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpXTUd"&gt;Here’s the full list of chat services that Beeper currently supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WXWYqb"&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qxrw5I"&gt;Facebook Messenger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vQZ1eg"&gt;iMessage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Phn8Xh"&gt;Android Messages (SMS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wa0ikm"&gt;Telegram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5dL2i7"&gt;Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZnJXG"&gt;Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XyQ9da"&gt;Hangouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QvDOmp"&gt;Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aDk10y"&gt;Skype&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NX1KQr"&gt;IRC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4GZTjq"&gt;Matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kKCCjk"&gt;Discord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vIljWB"&gt;Signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KSr2xk"&gt;Beeper network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IZTva7"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a VR headset that will include a fabric design, a fan, and an expensive price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s first VR headset may launch as soon as 2022 as a standalone device that operates through batteries, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is reportedly working on “some of its most advanced and powerful chips” for this unannounced VR headset, with some chips reportedly beating its own M1 Mac processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjaoPC"&gt;Apple has reportedly faced challenges in the development of this headset, with some prototypes ending up too big and heavy. Apple is reportedly using a fabric exterior to reduce the headset weight, but the company is also using a fan — an unusual move for Apple given its emphasis on fan-less design.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tii31X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the size of Apple’s VR headset, which is codenamed N301, is similar to the Oculus Quest, and some prototypes being tested include external cameras to enable some AR features. Apple is also reportedly testing the ability to use these cameras to track hand movements, and include software features like a virtual keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tT2Mk"&gt;It’s not clear exactly when Apple’s VR headset will launch, but it could be as soon as 2022. It will reportedly be an expensive and niche device, with some at Apple rumored to be anticipating that the company may sell only one headset per day at each of its retail stores, or less than 200,000 units per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frWB0X"&gt;Apple has been working on VR and AR headsets for years, according to various reports. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296674/apple-vr-ar-headset-glasses-external-hub-jony-ive-bloomberg-go-read-this"&gt;detailed look at Apple’s VR and AR ambitions&lt;/a&gt; last year, noting that the company has around 1,000 people working on AR and VR.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Linux has been ported to run on Apple’s M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-IpwDW3GHZj5o-3J6zhfJoB6t0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698905/vpavic_4291_20201113_0326.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tKNyW"&gt;A new Linux port allows Apple’s M1 Macs to run Ubuntu for the first time. Corellium, a security firm that offers a virtualized version of iOS for security testing, has successfully ported Ubuntu over to M1 Macs and released a tutorial for others to follow. The modified version of Ubuntu boots into the regular user interface and includes USB support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yav1NU"&gt;The team at Corellium have &lt;a href="https://corellium.com/blog/linux-m1"&gt;detailed exactly how&lt;/a&gt; they managed to get Ubuntu running, and it’s a good in-depth read if you’re interested in the details. While a number of M1 components are shared with Apple’s mobile chips, the non-standard chips made it challenging to create Linux drivers to get Ubuntu running properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtsFHk"&gt;Apple hasn’t designed its M1 Macs with dual-boot or Boot Camp in mind. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp"&gt;has previously ruled out official support&lt;/a&gt; for natively booting alternate operating systems like Windows or Linux. Virtualization seems to be Apple’s preferred method, but that hasn’t stopped people from making their own ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eFKgh1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Linux is now completely usable on the Mac mini M1. Booting from USB a full Ubuntu desktop (rpi). Network works via a USB c dongle. Update includes support for USB, I2C, DART. We will push changes to our GitHub and a tutorial later today. Thanks to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CorelliumHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CorelliumHQ&lt;/a&gt; team ❤️  &lt;a href="https://t.co/uBDbDmvJUG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uBDbDmvJUG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Wade (@cmwdotme) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1351838924621099008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v56Gaz"&gt;Hector Martin, a developer who regularly gets Linux running on a variety of hardware, is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1333459867323957251?s=21"&gt;also porting Linux to M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt;. Developers seem to be enticed by the performance benefits offered by Apple’s M1 chips, and the ability to run Linux on a silent ARM-based machine. “I’ve been waiting for an ARM laptop that can run Linux for a &lt;em&gt;long &lt;/em&gt;time,” said Linux creator Linus Torvalds &lt;a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=196533&amp;amp;curpostid=196570"&gt;back in November&lt;/a&gt;. “The new Air would be almost perfect, except for the OS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz7P96"&gt;Corellium CTO Chris Wade describes this new port as “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1351838924621099008"&gt;completely usable&lt;/a&gt;” on a Mac Mini M1, and it works by booting the full Ubuntu desktop from USB. You will need a USB-C dongle to get networking working, though, and the process to get the port running will require some familiarity with Linux and custom kernels. Corellium has posted a &lt;a href="https://corellium.com/blog/linux-m1"&gt;tutorial on the process&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in trying this beta project out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmANmX"&gt;Corellium has some experience in working around Apple’s operating system protections. Corellium offers security researchers a virtual iPhone to help with vulnerability exploration. It’s a process that has angered Apple enough to file lawsuits against Corellium. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205130/apple-corellium-dismissed-copyright-dmca-fair-use"&gt;Apple lost an early challenge&lt;/a&gt; against Corellium late last year, after initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20809109/apple-corellium-startup-company-lawsuit-court-virtual-iphone-software-copy"&gt;filing a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the company on copyright grounds back in August 2019. Apple later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047275/apple-corellium-dmca-lawsuit-copyright-research-jailbreak-security-copyright"&gt;alleged DMCA violations&lt;/a&gt; in January 2020, and a judge dismissed the copyright infringement claims in December. A ruling on the separate DMCA allegations has been deferred.&lt;/p&gt;
