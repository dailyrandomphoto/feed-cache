    <title>Australian regulator says Apple’s AirTag batteries are too easy for kids to access</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JSEfOK"&gt;Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has warned buyers to keep Apple AirTags away from young children, saying it’s too easy to remove a potentially dangerous battery from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;tiny location trackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITh5Cu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/parents-urged-to-keep-apple-airtags-away-from-children-as-safety-precaution"&gt;An ACCC statement&lt;/a&gt; cautions that AirTags’ small lithium button batteries can severely injure children if they leak or become stuck in a child’s throat, nose, or ear. It raises particular concerns about Apple’s design making those batteries too readily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OzgGzC"&gt;“The ACCC is concerned that the AirTag’s battery compartment could be accessible to young children, and the button battery removed with ease. In addition, the AirTag battery compartment’s lid does not always secure fully on closing, and a distinctive sound plays when an AirTag’s lid is being closed, suggesting the lid is secure when it may not be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jQA7PQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/28/keep-airtags-away-from-children/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Australian retailer Officeworks &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/04/airtags-withdrawn-from-sale-officeworks/"&gt;removed AirTags&lt;/a&gt; from its shelves last month, citing safety concerns. Apple has since added a new warning label to AirTag packaging, and the ACCC quotes Apple as saying that AirTags are “designed to meet international child safety standards.” The agency states that it’s currently discussing safety issues with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ecouuv"&gt;Many devices — including AirTag competitors — use button batteries. Some companies make them tougher to remove; Tile trackers, for instance, &lt;a href="https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009446833-How-do-I-replace-a-battery-"&gt;require a paperclip&lt;/a&gt; or precision screwdriver to swap a battery. Australia recently introduced new, stricter overall safety rules for devices using button batteries, and Apple isn’t the only company in the ACCC’s sights. Its statement says that it’s “assessing whether there are issues with button battery safety in similar Bluetooth tracking devices,” and companies that don’t meet the new standards will have until June 2022 to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Foundation trailer teases Apple TV Plus’ ambitious sci-fi epic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mohboaJl1O-BxjVERoORRaNlhIY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513208/062821_Apple_Sneak_Peek_Foundation.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UQFAID"&gt;Last week Apple revealed that &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming sc-fi show based on a series of books by Isaac Asimov, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547252/foundation-release-date-apple-tv-plus-september"&gt;would debut on Apple TV Plus in September&lt;/a&gt;. Now we have something even better: a proper trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuYkOB"&gt;It’s the first good look at the show since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295512/apple-tv-plus-foundation-show-trailer-isaac-asimov-wwdc-2020"&gt;the debut teaser last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it reveals what looks to be an ambitious series that could give Apple’s streaming service its own must-watch epic along the lines of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. The trailer shows lavish sets, big-name stars, and, of course, a baby floating in a tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZXK69q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Foundation’ has always been at the top of my bucket list.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PygMcd"&gt;The show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223728/apple-foundation-trilogy-isaac-asimov-tv-show-david-goyer-josh-friedman"&gt;which was first announced in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, is being helmed by showrunner David S. Goyer, and stars Lee Pace and Jared Harris. According to Apple, the story “chronicles a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire.” Here’s Goyer on the adaptation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BEl1P7"&gt;In the decades since the &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; series first saw print, Asimov’s prophetic science-fiction work has never been more relevant than it is now. Growing up, I devoured &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; and dreamed of one day seeing it on screen — but a feature film didn’t seem big enough to embrace the ambition. Thanks to the broader landscape of streaming and a valuable partnership with Apple and Skydance, we are able to bring the series to the screen in a way that truly does it justice. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; has always been at the top of my bucket list and I’m honored I get to play a part in finally bringing it to life. Whether you’re a fan of the novels or simply someone craving a mind-blowing epic, I’m excited to share with you what we’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="B2hNJQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; will debut on September 24th, with the first three (of 10) episodes available initially. Subsequent episodes will debut every Friday after that. It will follow another high-profile release, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season premiering in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 12.9 Max Plus is Brydge’s best iPad keyboard yet</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The biggest trackpad you can get, if not necessarily the best&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="6xcL1r"&gt;Brydge has been making iPad keyboards for nearly a decade now, and while the iPad itself has changed a lot over that time, the company has largely followed the same formula: design a keyboard that makes the iPad look like a MacBook Pro. The key design element has been the company’s trademark rubberized hinges, which the iPad slots into to form the other half of a laptop-style device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NBjK6"&gt;Now, Brydge is trying something slightly new. The 12.9 Max Plus, which starts shipping this week, is a keyboard case for the iPad Pro that does away with the hinge clamps and instead makes use of magnets for a sleeker and more convenient experience. The product also leans hard into Apple’s recent addition of cursor support to iPadOS, with a huge trackpad that’s comparable in size to what you’d find on a MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtPHtr"&gt;At $249.99, this is a premium product aimed at heavy iPad Pro users, and it’s only available for the biggest iPad size. Apple’s own Magic Keyboard is clearly formidable competition. But Brydge is able to undercut Apple by $100, and in some important ways, I prefer the Max Plus to the Magic Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eyi6iS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10627296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="riplm7"&gt;The most obvious difference between the Max Plus and other Brydge keyboards is the magnetic plate in which you rest the iPad. This offers protection for the back of the iPad without having to attach the snap-on magnetic cover that Brydge included on prior models, and more importantly, it’s far less fiddly to attach and detach the iPad than it was to squeeze it into the old-style hinge clamps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOMG5x"&gt;The tradeoff, of course, is that you’re adding a few millimeters of thickness behind the iPad, especially if (like me) you never bothered with the magnetic protective back covers supplied with previous Brydge keyboards. With 17mm of thickness and an extra 970g of weight, the resulting 12.9-inch “laptop” you get with the Max Plus is quite a bit thicker and heavier than a 13-inch MacBook Pro. The heft does help stabilize the combination, however, and it supports a wider range of viewing angles than the Magic Keyboard while feeling much more premium. As a tall person, the Magic Keyboard doesn’t always tilt back far enough to be comfortable for me, but I don’t have a problem with this Brydge. It’s also easier to use on your lap than a kickstand-based solution, as found in many of Logitech’s iPad keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4TfDO"&gt;While the magnet mechanism is convenient, the Max Plus unfortunately doesn’t use Apple’s Smart Connector for power and connectivity. This is still a Bluetooth device that you have to charge over USB-C, though the battery should last weeks or months on a charge depending on your usage (specifically how much you use the backlight). The Smart Connector would have been preferable, but it’s only ever appeared on Apple’s own products and Logitech devices that have been designed with Apple’s cooperation; it hasn’t shown up in any Brydge products or other devices from similarly smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFASzfownXGUwv-IYVmQ4rbDR4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22685746/IMG_20210628_151930_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been testing the white version of the Max Plus, which creates an unusual sandwich effect with my space gray iPad Pro. Silver and gray options are also available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mj753N"&gt;Brydge has at least improved the Bluetooth experience in one notable way compared to most of its older products. The Max Plus has a feature called Instant-On that makes use of Bluetooth 5.0 to stay in a low-power state for up to four hours, meaning that if you step away from the iPad and come back it’ll instantly wake with a button press with no need for reconnection. That goes some way to making the combination feel more like a coherent product, because in practice you aren’t likely to find yourself running into laggy reconnection issues during a typical work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xTdfx"&gt;The keyboard itself is good. It feels a touch more responsive than previous Brydge products, but you’re not getting mechanical-level tactility here, of course — it’s just an above-average laptop keyboard. What really sets it apart when compared to Apple’s Magic Keyboard is the extra function row, which is very useful in iPadOS for things like brightness and volume control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6EipB"&gt;The trackpad is a key selling point for the Max Plus. It can’t quite match the Magic Keyboard on pure responsiveness, which is no surprise given Apple’s low-level system access, but it does a good job nonetheless, and Brydge has been making continuous improvements to the firmware. It’s a huge trackpad by any standard, which makes using it for things like photo browsing and text editing a lot more enjoyable. Even though it has a diving board-style mechanism that doesn’t let you click everywhere (particularly in the upper left and right corners), there’s more than enough space and I had no problem using it just like I would a MacBook Pro’s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUqIRlpRPwD7GiezfnjCWXV-_4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22685745/IMG_20210628_151714_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brydge Max Plus has a huge trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RE52s4"&gt;The Brydge Max Plus isn’t for everyone, but then neither are iPad keyboards in general. Even though Apple came out with a good option last year, it’s very expensive and not without its quirks. What you get with the Max Plus is a less expensive — but still quite pricey — option that, more so than any Brydge keyboard to date, gives the iPad a laptop’s form factor and functionality. It’s not as slick or as inventive as the Magic Keyboard, but it’s more useful for my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2qqMw"&gt;Brydge is really competing with itself here as much as Apple. Its previous highest end model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287000/brydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch"&gt;the 12.9 Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;, just got a significant price cut to $169.99 and offers essentially the same functionality, just with a smaller trackpad and the old hinge design. I prefer the Max Plus, but the Pro Plus is a good option if you want to save some weight and cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hd8LsO"&gt;There are still clear limitations to iPadOS, but cursor support really transformed the experience of working on an iPad, and no accessory embodies that better than the Brydge Max Plus. It’s not perfect, but right now it’s what I’d choose to get work done on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Harder They Fall, Ted Lasso, The Suicide Squad, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FwBR07XF1meccu6ml0OlduyE8yE=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69510942/king_and_elba.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Regina King and Idris Elba in &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKz5kZr8mrg&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5eTIke"&gt;Since it was one of the top picks on Netflix and everyone’s talking about it, I started watching Manifest and got five episodes in before I realized it was basically a version of Lost with a few wacky twists and I am not falling for THAT again. But the deeply weird and wonderful &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; is back, and the pilot had Christine Baranski and Audra McDonald at their best, so I can’t wait to see what happens this season (although we said goodbye to two of the show’s best characters, boo). Also can we talk about &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;? We probably can’t without giving away spoilers but episode three gave us a LOT, most of which I suspect were attempts at misdirection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQN1sH"&gt;I got so engrossed in writing last Sunday’s trailers post that I totally missed the new &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; trailer that dropped that day. Derp. Don’t worry, I’ve included it here (in case you haven’t already watched it 1,000 times like I have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OPphFJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKz5kZr8mrg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AUbM7U"&gt;The Harder They Fall &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iPeNzE"&gt;This trailer (sorry, it’s the official &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;teaser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) for a Western about rival outlaw gangs opens with a train heist where Regina King and Lakeith Stanfield free Idris Elba from captivity— with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zWRjgathjA&amp;amp;ab_channel=gd73"&gt;“Let’s Start”&lt;/a&gt; by Fela Kuti playing — and then proceed to shoot their way out in slow-motion. It’s almost too much cool to take in all at once. Our plot: Outlaw Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) and his gang Stagecoach Mary (Zazie Beetz), Bill Pickett (Edi Gathegi), and Jim Beckwourth (RJ Cyler) are rivals of the newly-released Rufus Buck (Elba) and his crew, Treacherous Judy Smith (King), and Cherokee Bill (Stanfield). Delroy Lindo and Damon Wayans Jr., also star in &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt;, (what a cast!) which is directed by Jeymes Samuel and is coming to Netflix soon (hurry up pls!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yRcGXN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/reP1gVGpFKo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R4dHfK"&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RXhhjk"&gt;Ted unleashes his alter ego Led Tasso to be tough and mean to the floundering Richmond football club and it’s so goofy and ridiculous but so very &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; (lol he calls them “turd birds” what?). Jason Sudeikis and the rest of the crew are back in the second season, and we have less than a month to wait for new episodes, you guys (side note: you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543775/apple-tv-ted-lasso-merch-kit-jersey-trailer-season-2"&gt;buy Richmond jerseys&lt;/a&gt; at the Ted Lasso merch store). Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; premieres July 23rd on Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3khcqb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eg5ciqQzmK0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="B9yc13"&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V7HVWx"&gt;Is Idris Elba in every movie coming out this summer? (for the record I am very OK with this). James Gunn’s take on the band of supervillains led by Elba as Bloodsport (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1407730256283193351"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; at last!) has them taking on even badder bad guys on a remote jungle island. Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman, Michael Rooker, Pete Davidson, Nathan Fillion, and John Cena also star in&lt;em&gt; The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and HBO Max on August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PKpjTu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YjFbMbfXaQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QJyLPV"&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HCs08s"&gt;We saw a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;teaser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for this movie back in April, but this is the official &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trailer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (and again, I don’t think there’s really much difference between teasers and trailers anymore, but I digress). Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi, trained as an assassin as a child, who is trying to escape to have a normal life. This latest movie in the Marvel cinematic universe has an almost entirely Asian cast, including its title character. And yes, the giant monster Shang-Chi is shown fighting in a cage match &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MCU_Direct/status/1408233747082878988?"&gt;looks to be Abomination&lt;/a&gt;. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Awkwafina also star in &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,&lt;/em&gt; coming to theaters September 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7PAyF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKG0RodrzVo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EPVmei"&gt;Schmigadoon! &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCQ1aL"&gt;Keegan Michael Key and Cecily Strong play a couple trapped in a musical until they find true love. OK, sure, why not. This six-episode series has an all-star cast of musical talent, including Kristin Chenoweth, Alan Cummings, Fred Armisen, Jane Krakowski, and Martin Short. This feels like one of those flicks that is either going to be super funny or super cringe (although I did laugh at Strong’s character realizing that musicals kill people off all the time, so that’s a good sign). &lt;em&gt;Schmigadoon! &lt;/em&gt;(I’ll let them have the exclamation point) comes to Apple TV Plus on July 16th, with new episodes every Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I00scW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly sends warning letter to Chinese leaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IjOarRV2oNTOUTQIzC-b_KTdAOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69506761/vpavic_042020_3980_0055.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bH10md"&gt;Despite Apple’s efforts to keep anyone from finding out what it’s working on, leaks have continued to give the world early previews of new iPhones, Macs and more. Its campaign to plug the holes is apparently extending to threats of legal action, as the leaker known as “Kang” &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1694917363/KlE4Ozlsd?from=page_1005051694917363_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;ssl_rnd=1624542267.3793&amp;amp;type=comment"&gt;posted to Weibo&lt;/a&gt; this week about a notice he received from the company (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/reliable-leaker-kang-hit-with-warning/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEq4Ok"&gt;Kang currently holds the &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/kang/"&gt;number one spot on the AppleTrack leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to compare the reliability of the information various leakers share, and &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/apple-targets-leakers-and-collaborators-in-new-offensive-to-stop-rumors/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ReviveOldPost"&gt;AppleTrack indicates&lt;/a&gt; that other leakers have received similar messages. Prior to the iPhone 12 launch, Kang posted about all four models that Apple had prepared, revealing their prices, colors and planned release dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WelwFO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 12: everything we think we know about Apple’s 2020 5G iPhones, which could be announced on October 13th ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21423811/apple-iphone-12-max-pro-leaks-rumors-specs-design-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FLVL0Q"&gt;According to Kang, the letter from a law firm claimed that his actions could share information with Apple’s competitors, or mislead consumers about devices that aren’t coming. It also included screenshots of his Weibo page, showing posts beyond the leaks, like ones where he talked about problems he’s had with Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKPO8n"&gt;For his part, Kang claims to have never signed an NDA, published undisclosed pictures or profited from his information. Still, the tracker shows his information has revealed details about everything from the iPhone SE to the HomePod mini. Content creator Ben Geskin &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenGeskin/status/1408121541150269446"&gt;mentioned receiving&lt;/a&gt; a similar notice last year, while fellow leaker L0vetodream (number five on the source ranking list) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/L0vetodream/status/1408018049102356484"&gt;said they had not received anything&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnVfPT"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment about the letters or how many were sent. As for Kang, the post indicates he won’t post “riddles” or “dreams” about upcoming devices, so while the weight of the threat is unclear, it may have had Apple’s intended effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hybrid work is coming to big tech. Its contractors might not be so lucky</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FRANCE-ECONOMY-HEALTH-VIRUS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJeccnQcyc1wYovV-Wtr19gpbMM=/0x0:5453x3635/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69503849/1229318293.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by CHRISTOPHE ARCHAMBAULT/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRoNjf"&gt;In fits and starts, the US is reopening — in many cases to the chagrin of office workers who have settled into work-from-wherever setups they’ve had the past 16-ish months to perfect. And given the willingness of many of those same workers to quit rather than go back to full-time cubicle life, many companies have offered some form of “hybrid” arrangement as a compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrj36O"&gt;It seems that benefit isn’t being extended to all workers, though. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft were short on concrete answers as to which contingent workers — which comprise sizable, sometimes majority portions of their workforce, and perform functions from hospitality and security to content moderation and coding — if any would be allowed to work remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="CCIz44"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10619076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sbMzdw"&gt;Each of these tech giants appear to be instituting some version of partial remote work for corporate employees, with some minor variations. &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-updates-return-to-office-guidance"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/22/the-philosophy-and-practice-of-our-hybrid-workplace/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; each announced these changes publicly on their corporate blogs, while internal memos to the same effect within Facebook and Apple were reported on by the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-lets-more-employees-choose-full-time-remote-work-or-return-to-the-office-11623258049"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. All instituted a future of what Microsoft hazily described as “working from home part of the time (less than 50%) as standard for most roles,” and its competitors as some variation of requiring three days per week in the office. Apple took the extra step of mandating which three days — Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WerBel"&gt;There are of course, caveats in both directions. Some roles were flagged by Facebook and Amazon as not being remote work-applicable: jobs like hardware engineers and data center workers. On the other hand, nearly all of these companies noted that eligible employees could remain fully remote if they were granted that permission by their manager. Google even &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-rolls-out-tool-to-show-its-employees-compensation-changes-for-transferring-offices/"&gt;developed a tool&lt;/a&gt; that will show remote workers how much it plans to shave off their salaries if they go the remote option and move somewhere with a lower cost of living. (Thanks?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nA3t6B"&gt;Missing from any of these memos or announcements, though, was any mention of whether remote work options were available to the legions of contractors that help these companies function. Spokespeople for most of these companies sidestepped the question. “When it comes down to our contractors and partners, I wouldn’t be able to speak on their behalf or how they would implement our policy,” an Amazon spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Facebook provided a similar answer. Facebook’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for a list of which agencies they used for contract labor so that we could ask each company about its remote work policies, while Amazon declined to provide one citing “confidentiality reasons.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8YErj"&gt;A spokesperson with Google stated that temporary staff would likely be required to come in the same days as the teams of employees that oversee them, while the companies that employ its contingent “vendors” had already determined which jobs could or could not perform their work remotely. The same spokesperson was not able to provide an approximate percentage for how many of these vendors would have that benefit extended to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hzmjz"&gt;Through an external communications agency, a spokesperson for Microsoft wrote that aforementioned corporate blog was “all the company has to share.” Apple did not respond to multiple requests for information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qnZ98"&gt;It’s logical to defer to these external agencies, but it also belies how much leverage tech companies have in these relationships. Microsoft has previously &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/076474aa0b1b47b6b4790dbf98ed6108"&gt;required&lt;/a&gt; firms it works with provide paid childcare leave for its contractors; Google too has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-require-suppliers-give-benefits-workers/"&gt;mandated&lt;/a&gt; contractors receive at least $15 per hour, healthcare, and parental leave. Facebook has also &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/05/compensating-and-supporting-contractors/"&gt;instituted&lt;/a&gt; “well-being and resiliency training” for its contractor moderators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBDFO2"&gt;It’s also a bit hard to believe — especially in instances where these workers would be reporting to these companies’ facilities — that these companies lack any direct oversight over who is coming into their offices at a time when indoor capacity limits are not only a matter of corporate policy, but often a matter of state mandate too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgpBMi"&gt;The issues of remote work for contractors is also not a new one — and much earlier in the pandemic it caused quite a bit of bad PR for several of these companies. Facebook took heat from having some of those same content moderators working from the office back in November, a month where the US was seeing around 100,000 new cases of covid daily — and from awarding monetary bonuses to employees &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/17/facebook-coronavirus-bonus-contractors/"&gt;but not to contractors&lt;/a&gt;. Google was requiring some contractors to report to work in person in March of 2020, sparking internal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184495/google-employees-memo-contract-workers-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;backlash from its own employees&lt;/a&gt;; it also rescinded job offers to around 2,000 contractors — citing the economic downturn — while apportioning $1,000 each for employees to purchase desks and other items for their from-home workspaces. Around the same time, hundreds of contractor jobs with Apple were reportedly suspended without pay — only to be restored after a contingent of unionized janitors and the Wall Street Journal began &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-commits-to-paying-contractors-after-some-were-told-theyd-lose-work-11585667276"&gt;asking questions&lt;/a&gt;. Most of this &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7j7mb/amazon-delivery-drivers-are-overwhelmed-and-overworked-by-covid-19-surge"&gt;barely holds a candle&lt;/a&gt; to what Amazon’s considerably more frontline delivery contractors experienced, as a whole country, trapped inside, dramatically increased its online purchasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqZlJx"&gt;This is all relevant insofar as it illustrates that the two-tiered system of employment within these companies is alive and well, but also that these very big, very wealthy companies, supposedly staffed by the best and brightest, had many, many months to consider a return to office plan that would be transparent and comprehensible. Contractors themselves, and a news media willing to report on them, has been asking how tech companies will handle this disparity in benefits &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/09/tech-contractors-coronavirus/"&gt;essentially since the pandemic began&lt;/a&gt;. A year and a half later, there’s still no clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDduGv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to Spotify on this nostalgic iPod-style web music player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uDmQ2dBlwx_rwed9iaXCBEqlecE=/0x0:1301x867/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497486/msedge_a3fZpfyz0z.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A classic iPod interface for your Spotify or Apple Music library.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: tannerv.com/ipod&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E1SnOd"&gt;In an era before multitouch displays, the iPod’s click wheel was the king of music playback control. Now, a new project from frontend software developer Tanner Villarete has attempted to emulate its classic controls &lt;a href="https://tannerv.com/ipod/"&gt;as a web app&lt;/a&gt;, complete with support for your Spotify and Apple Music library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrKaLi"&gt;It’s fantastically simple, using your mouse or finger on a touchscreen to emulate the classic controls. You’ll need to sign in using an Apple Music or Spotify Account, and then it’s a simple case of using the virtual click wheel to select and listen to a selection of your most listened-to artists. It even supports the iPod’s classic “Cover Flow” interface, letting you to flip through album covers like a jukebox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hP_hg_8nKMgRMrqrUd8Flpzsp80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678584/msedge_qAYmQ76Ggy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: tannerv.com/ipod&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And yes, it totally has a built-in Brick Breaker clone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BPYGOk"&gt;Now, obviously there’s a reason why modern apps don’t use click wheel interfaces. Using the touch-sensitive wheel via a phone’s web browser feels ok, but on desktop having to drag a mouse around a virtual circle feels &lt;em&gt;inefficient&lt;/em&gt; at best. It’s at its worst when loading up the virtual iPod’s built-in Brick Breaker game clone (which, sidenote, also rips). But as a nostalgic trip down memory lane? Perfection. The project is &lt;a href="https://github.com/tvillarete/ipod-classic-js"&gt;on GitHub here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to have a poke around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pp7NO"&gt;Apple killed off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/4715274/ipod-classic-discontinued-a-visual-history"&gt;classic iPod design in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. It now sells just one iPod branded device, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656480/apple-ipod-touch-7th-generation-2019-update-review"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;, which in terms of hardware is effectively a dated iPhone with no cellular connectivity, biometric authentication, or other modern features. We’d love to see the classic design return, but according to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/28/7082095/tim-cook-says-apple-killed-the-ipod-classic-because-it-couldnt-get"&gt;simply couldn’t get the parts anymore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZCPJd"&gt;Let’s just hope Apple doesn’t kill the project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024729/apple-rewound-app-iphone-ipod-click-wheel-web-android-not-available"&gt;like it did Rewound&lt;/a&gt;, the music player app that &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; attempted to bring back the iPod’s classic control scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo made a wireless charger for your laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sew8VjSvFkcnV0hCLzVP0e8_0LE=/0x0:2100x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497384/Screenshot_2021_06_24_at_15.18.45.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bg2Y7S"&gt;Lenovo has announced a new product called the Go Wireless Charging Kit, which lets you retrofit wireless charging functionality to a wide variety of laptops. It makes use of “Power by Contact” technology from Energy Square, rather than the more common Qi standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzneP1"&gt;The kit consists of a 3.2mm-thick brushed metal charging mat that you plug into the wall and leave at your desk, as well as a long wireless charging receiver that attaches to the base of your laptop and connects over USB-C. Once set up, Lenovo says it should charge most 13-inch to 14-inch “non-touch notebooks of up to 65W” with efficiency of 93 percent, and it’ll work with both Windows and macOS devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i30wzLO4H8xfFUsRUHss8S0dojQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678555/02_Lenovo_Go_USB_C_Wireless_Charging_Kit_Mat_Dongle_Hero_Front.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x6zjKJ"&gt;Wireless charging on laptops is pretty rare. Dell released what it called the world’s first wirelessly charging 2-in-1, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15955350/dell-latitude-7000-price-availability-wireless-charging"&gt;the Latitude 7285&lt;/a&gt;, in 2017, although it was more of a tablet that could be charged through a keyboard base. Intel also made efforts to integrate the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/20/5430310/a4wp-wireless-ultrabook-charging-dell-joins"&gt;Rezence&lt;/a&gt; magnetic resonance charging standard into its laptop specifications, but nothing was ever released commercially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vx2meT"&gt;Lenovo will release the Go Wireless Charging Kit in October for $139.99. It’s part of a new range of Go-branded mobile accessories including a Qi-equipped power bank, wireless mice, headphones, and keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple may be looking to make a less expensive big phone in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-5IOh_hyZLO3rP-d4_rJF-ixICw=/498x0:2802x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496618/Screen_Shot_2021_06_23_at_3.53.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aVq5eH"&gt;According to noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will sell an iPhone with a 6.7-inch screen for less than $900 in 2022 (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/23/kuo-2022-iphones-could-feature-under-display-touch-id-lowest-price-ever-for-6-7-inch-iphone/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If this turns out to be the case, iPhone 14 buyers will have a less expensive way to get a screen size that Apple currently only sells on the 12 Pro Max, which starts at $1,099. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKs7gA"&gt;Kuo predicts that Apple’s 2022 non-pro iPhone lineup includes phones with 6.1 and 6.7-inch screens (the same sizes as the current iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, respectively). Absent is the iPhone Mini with its 5.4-inch screen. Analysts, including Kuo, have said that the Mini will be going away in 2022 due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;reportedly low sales&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOFORJ"&gt;While some may mourn the loss of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus"&gt;an actually small phone option&lt;/a&gt;, from Apple’s perspective, going big with its line of mainstream phones makes sense. We know from documents unearthed in the Epic v. Apple trial that Apple commissioned a report on the smartphone purchasing habits of consumers late last year. The report showed both that many customers were buying phones that had screens larger than six inches and that more people were turning to Samsung than Apple for their big phone needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cp_Grsgbx--DQMHTv8awM5dW7L4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678069/apple_charts.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charts from the report showing the screen size breakdown for phones sold and average price points.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cb9O4E"&gt;Both companies face &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166399/iphone-android-apple-samsung-smartphone-sales-peak"&gt;a market that is slowing down&lt;/a&gt;, and one that is having to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18263584/why-phones-are-so-expensive-price-apple-samsung-google"&gt;grapple with rising costs&lt;/a&gt;. If Apple has made the decision to make a lower-end big phone, it’s done so after seeing the research that many consumers want phones that are both bigger, and cheaper. While Apple has somewhat been working toward that goal (the iPhone 12, 11, and XR have all had 6.1-inch screens), it’s generally kept the really big phones at the high-end — next year could be its time to court users who want something bigger than 6.1-inches, but don’t want to spend over $1,000 to get it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fxKBtV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s generally kept the really big phones at the high-end&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ncmGUf"&gt;In addition to his prediction about the lower-end 6.7-inch iPhone, &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Kuo said the 2022 iPhones will have under-display fingerprint readers, and that there will be a new &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/23/kuo-new-iphone-se-with-5g-and-new-processor-still-on-track-for-first-half-of-2022/"&gt;iPhone SE with 5G&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYDTyc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: We previously stated the iPhone 12 mini had a 5.7-inch screen, but it has a 5.4-inch screen. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fxqS1UL0ZIZ3XuVGNFE20_03YFo=/0x201:1080x921/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496407/Combo_Touch_for_iPad_Air_Oxford_Grey_Beautiful_Design_Enviro_1080x1080.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Combo Touch case.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iE98Y1"&gt;Logitech is releasing a version of its Combo Touch keyboard case, which has a Microsoft Surface-style kickstand and a detachable keyboard with an integrated trackpad, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.logitech.com%2F2021%2F06%2F23%2Flogitech-announces-combo-touch-for-ipad-air-and-new-color%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F23%2F22547938%2Flogitech-combo-touch-ipad-air-fourth-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for the fourth-generation iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;. The case will cost $199.99, making it $100 cheaper than Apple’s Magic Keyboard that fits the iPad Air, and it will be available in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y92CD4"&gt;The Combo Touch’s keyboard is powered by the iPad’s Smart Connector, meaning that you won’t need to charge up the keyboard on its own, and it offers backlit keys and iPadOS shortcut keys. The case also a handy open spot at the top where you can store a second-gen Apple Pencil, which attaches magnetically to the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpBqDE"&gt;This case’s design might feel familiar — it looks nearly identical to the Combo Touch cases that were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395219/logitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro"&gt;recently released for the 2021 iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;. It also seems like it will be an upgrade from the version of the Combo Touch that fits the third-generation iPad Air — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231088/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-keyboard-trackpad-case-review-price-specs-features"&gt;and my colleague Phil Esposito already liked that case a lot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7DC8y"&gt;Speaking of the Combo Touch for the iPad Pros, Logitech is also introducing a new “sand” color (I’d describe it as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Fcombo-touch-ipad.html%3Fcrid%3D1762%23buy-combo-touch-ipad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F23%2F22547938%2Flogitech-combo-touch-ipad-air-fourth-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a light gray&lt;/a&gt;) that will also be available in July.&lt;/p&gt;
