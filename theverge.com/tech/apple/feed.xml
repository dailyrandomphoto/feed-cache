    <title>HBO Max update fixes the worst of its Apple TV woes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uHisVp"&gt;HBO Max has updated its Apple TV app as it attempts to fix the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525177/hbo-max-apple-tv-broken-button-controls"&gt;myriad issues&lt;/a&gt; that have been plaguing the software since last week. The update &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;fixes significant problems&lt;/a&gt; with basic features like fast-forwarding and rewinding, which had been introduced after the software switched away from using the native tvOS video player. The software update brings the native player back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boCiIG"&gt;“We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come,” HBO Max &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEKmLc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come. Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here. Thank you for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— HBOMaxHelp (@HBOMaxHelp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uA2VlS"&gt;Although the worst of the issues appear to have been fixed, users on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;HBOMax subreddit&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that some bugs remain after the new update. One user reports that they’re finding their subtitles keep &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/h14cg1l?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;reverting back to Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Thankfully, as another user has pointed out, the new update makes it easier to switch subtitles back, a process which the previous update had made &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly#:~:text=turning%20on%2Foff%20subtitles%20requires%20pressing%20pause%2C%20swiping%20down%20then%20across%20to%20subtitles%2C%20pressing%20again%20then%20scrolling%20to%20your%20desired%20option%2C%20pressing%20yet%20again%20then%20resuming%20playback.%20before%2C%20you%20could%20swipe%20down%2C%20select%20your%20choice%2C%20then%20swipe%20up%20again%20-%20the%20standard%20tvos%20way."&gt;significantly more difficult&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXzQuQ"&gt;Questions remain about how such broken software was able to be released to users in the first place. Responding to a tweet from &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; editor in chief Nilay Panel, HBO Max’s EVP and general manager Andy Forssell admitted that this was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595"&gt;the zillion dollar question&lt;/a&gt;” and that the company would be investigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max has been busted for days </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IMhD-qZm5Fgljs7YY1kaw_O9nPY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69425659/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0tRNJ"&gt;If you’ve attempted to stream something on HBO Max from an Apple TV sometime during the last several days, you may have noticed that its player controls are unusable. It’s not just you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqDmgf"&gt;Ongoing issues seem to be related to an &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hbo-max-stream-tv-movies/id971265422"&gt;app update&lt;/a&gt; that supposedly addressed “a few bugs lurking around” on June 5th. Since that update released, users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1401730242775961600"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; that basic playback functionality — such as fast-forwarding, rewinding, and pausing — is borked completely when you try to use the service on an Apple TV box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POJuAO"&gt;How an update this riddled with bugs rolled out to consumers remains unclear. Unfortunately, it’s also unclear when exactly they’re going to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l3P1rU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There’s legitimately no way to pause, rewind or fast forward on the HBO Max app no matter if you use the apple remote or the remote mobile app. Idk how anyone is watching anything on there&lt;/p&gt;— Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1401730242775961600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PgIQWY"&gt;Asked for comment on Tuesday, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was working to fix the issue “as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8wi12"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s editor in chief Nilay Patel tweeted about the issue, HBO Max’s EVP and general manager &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401771759641055244"&gt;Andy Forssell replied&lt;/a&gt; that the company was undertaking “one whale of an effort to address this with app updates as soon as humanly possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8iuUh"&gt;“You’ll hear no excuses from us,” Forssell added, “fixes coming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZP1rz"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1401883622089674752"&gt;when asked&lt;/a&gt; by Patel how it was possible that the update shipped to users with broken playback controls, the HBO Max head said that was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595"&gt;the zillion dollar question&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="60k69f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@reckless&lt;/a&gt; That's the zillion dollar question. First priority is to deliver for users in addressing the issues, but in parallel we will also dive deep into that question. More to come.&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Forssell (@aforssell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ro2i5x"&gt;On Twitter, the HBO Max help account is replying directly to frustrated users. “We’re aware that our recent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HBOMax?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; app update for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV"&gt;@AppleTV&lt;/a&gt; led to a number of issues for our viewers,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402409361461460993"&gt;the account said in one tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Our team is working quickly to restore the experience you’re used to. We appreciate your patience and will provide updates as they become available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gX9MN"&gt;Separately, on Friday,&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted the service about reported issues affecting the new Siri Remote’s scrubbing feature — though that issue was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22519340/siri-remote-scrubbing-feature-disney-plus"&gt;not limited to just HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, a spokesperson said that it was aware of player control issues as well as “a few isolated reports” of HDR playback problems. But the spokesperson also added that the company did not believe the HDR issues were related to an update, as the most recent update at the time did not include changes to the video player itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eE5Z0L"&gt;Given the problems with the app right now, if you were hoping to stream the &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; finale on your Apple TV box without issue, you may want to hold off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XsQAR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 9th, 3:52AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; HBO Max has &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525635/hbo-max-apple-tv-app-update-native-tvos-player-fixed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;released an update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for its Apple TV app which users are reporting fixes many of the issues detailed above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Apple end the newsletter boom?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RD0R-lkFZ-_jO5BAwDNoqO6YZZw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69425567/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZW5kE"&gt;Today, let’s talk about one of Apple’s many announcements this week at its Worldwide Developer Conference, which some see as a possible threat to the rise of journalism distributed by email. If that sounds self-indulgent, given that it’s coming from a journalist who distributes his work via email, I apologize. But it touches on so many of the subjects of interest to us here — a tech giant’s ability to reshape markets to its liking; how journalism will navigate the platform era; what we mean when we talk about privacy — that I hope I can pique your interest at least a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xb0lpy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wnk4BD"&gt;Start with the announcement. On Monday at WWDC, Apple announced&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DIn%2520the%2520Mail%2520app%252C%2520Mail%2Cused%2520to%2520determine%2520their%2520location.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22525195%2Fapple-mail-protection-privacy-pixel-tracking-newsletters-substack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Mail Privacy Protection&lt;/a&gt;, which will limit the amount of data that people who send you emails can collect about you. Here’s how the company describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aGxsdc"&gt;In the Mail app, Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user. The new feature helps users prevent senders from knowing when they open an email, and masks their IP address so it can’t be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6x6I6C"&gt;When you eventually update your iPhone to iOS 15 this fall, you’ll see a screen at launch that invites you to opt in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="mUonCX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;iOS 15: First launch of Mail app. &lt;a href="https://t.co/W4ewu9XFCk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/W4ewu9XFCk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Jones (@rjonesy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1401993816001978375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="04KYBc"&gt;Let’s assume most Apple Mail users opt in. How necessary is this data to building email-based businesses? Over the past day I’ve read and heard lots of disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56SUVK"&gt;Some quick background for the non-email obsessives. Long ago, email marketers began including invisible pixels in the emails they send you; when you open their messages, those pixels load, telling the sender that you read their message, and might also infer your location from your IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfGydg"&gt;Collectively, the percentage of people that actually open emails is known as the open rate, and it’s one of the most important metrics that senders measure to gauge the effectiveness of what they’re doing. It gives you a sense of how engaged your audience is, and how that engagement is changing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYikKE"&gt;At the same time, there is a fairly long tradition of people finding this creepy. The email startup Superhuman &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/superhuman-founder-apology-email-tracking-spyware-backlash-2019-7"&gt;had to apologize in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after a viral blog post explained how the company tracked when, where, and how often people opened emails sent through its service. &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, a nonprofit newsroom that often focuses on issues of data privacy, turned down eight potential email providers &lt;a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/themarkup/issues/hello-from-the-markup-199187"&gt;before finding one that would agree to turn off tracking capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFJtaC"&gt;Last year, when Basecamp launched the email service Hey, it made the blocking of tracking pixels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch"&gt;a marquee feature&lt;/a&gt;. In a blog post today, Basecamp cofounder David Heinemeier Hansson — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;no fan of Apple in general&lt;/a&gt;! — declared victory against tracking pixels. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OfxG3V"&gt;Given Apple’s monopoly advantage with their preinstalled Mail app, we don’t need much of an uptake from what they’re calling Mail Privacy Protection to break the dam on spy pixels. You can’t really say anything authoritatively about open rates if 5-10-30-50% of your recipients are protected against snooping, as you won’t know whether that’s why your spy pixel isn’t tripping, or it’s because they’re just not opening your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfvbxc"&gt;There’s also simply no way users are going to willingly accept the premise of spy pixels if Apple presents the privacy dangers as clearly and as honestly as we’ve done in HEY. Apple already showed that with their drive to block unique ad identifiers for cross-app tracking in iOS 14.5: &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/targeted-ads-are-staggeringly-unpopular-so-we-should-ban-them-01c13a9c"&gt;96% of users in the US have declined to let apps track them like that!&lt;/a&gt; And email spy pixels are far worse and much creepier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8DWPeA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rZR9KN"&gt;Let’s stipulate a few things up front. One, most people still don’t know that these spy pixels exist. Two, if they did, most people probably wouldn’t allow them if given the choice. Three, the majority of these spy pixels are used for marketing purposes — efforts to target you better for e-commerce. I do not think it is at all irrational to look at the state of affairs the way Apple did, and say to hell with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x66xXB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s why people hate advertising and ad companies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAJgjU"&gt;At the same time, email-based publishing has been of the few bright spots for journalism in recent years. (Certainly it has been a bright spot for me!) Media companies from Facebook to Twitter to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; are now investing heavily in newsletter strategies; new email-based publishers are &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/40-north-tpg-digital-media-startup-funding-69eacb52-1ff8-42ba-8742-32b36d762d3c.html"&gt;popping up seemingly every week&lt;/a&gt;. Much of this has come in the wake of the success of Substack, which I use to publish Platformer (&lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/platformer/Ethics-Policy-e8ee22c0ce7b4228b5da482a83b2ab76"&gt;see disclosure&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu3vav"&gt;And so it’s no surprise that some observers look at Mail Privacy Protection and see a threat. “This is another sign that Apple’s war against targeted advertising isn’t just about screwing Facebook,” Joshua Benton &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/06/a-packed-set-of-apple-announcements-could-have-big-impacts-on-news-publishers-for-good-and-for-ill/"&gt;wrote in Nieman Lab&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re also coming for your Substack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUTtW8"&gt;Benton brings some powerful numbers to buttress his worries: “The &lt;a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/email-client-market-share-may-2021/"&gt;most recent market-share numbers from Litmus&lt;/a&gt;, for May 2021, &lt;em&gt;93.5%&lt;/em&gt; of all email opens on phones come in Apple Mail on iPhones or iPads,” he writes. “On desktop, Apple Mail on Mac is responsible for &lt;em&gt;58.4%&lt;/em&gt; of all email opens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5xrPG"&gt;It seems clear that Apple’s move to cut off granular customer data from email senders will affect the email economy. But after conversations with newsletter writers and media executives today, I’m not sure that people doing email-based journalism have all that much to worry about from the shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJYHGc"&gt;“The advertising industry has addicted itself to tracking, prioritizing bottom of the funnel metrics at the expense of great content and creative. It’s tragic,” said Alex Kantrowitz, author of the free, ad-supported newsletter &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (He previously covered the industry for &lt;em&gt;Ad Age&lt;/em&gt;.) “And it’s why people hate advertising and ad companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BORsUb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;in this case, it mostly strikes me as a false alarm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yu5mu5"&gt;Kantrowitz told me that his ad inventory was sold out for the first half of the year, thanks to a premium audience he identified not by pixel-based tracking but by a good old-fashioned reader survey. (&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, too, has used reader surveys to build a picture of its user base.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTGZAX"&gt;“Pixel blocking makes placements like this more valuable and gives quality email newsletters a leg up on the junk clogging most people’s inboxes,” Kantrowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPBUQp"&gt;For ad-based newsletters, then, Mail Privacy Protection is likely to spur publishers to find other ways to understand their audiences. But what about paid newsletters, like the one this column is syndicated from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9vz8d"&gt;Apple’s move may affect reader-supported newsletters even less, publishing industry executives told me today. Writers can triangulate reader engagement by plenty of metrics that are still available to them, including the views their stories get on the web, the overall growth of their mailing list, and — most meaningful of all — the growth of their revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OiZpQ"&gt;The media business changes so quickly that I don’t find it at all irrational to read about a move like the one Apple made this week and assume it will be bad for journalism. But in this case, it mostly strikes me as a false alarm. There are any number of changes that major email providers including Apple, Google, and Microsoft could make that would make life more difficult for newsletter-based businesses. In the end, though, I don’t think blocking spy pixels is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Xce2am"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="99mWAK"&gt;All that said, I can’t end without pointing out the ways in which Apple itself benefits from cracking down on email data collection. The first one is obvious: it further burnishes the company’s privacy credentials, part of an ongoing and incredibly successful public-relations campaign to build user trust during a time of collapsing faith in institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o30tbg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;And what of creators who want to move away from the ad model?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp1Ndb"&gt;Taken together, the numerous iOS 15 features focused on user privacy combine to place more pressure on the digital ad ecosystem. Perhaps most notably, “Private Relay” — available to paying subscribers of Apple’s iCloud+ service — will encrypt all traffic leaving a user’s device, making them harder for advertisers to track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8ePgs"&gt;One of my more cynical friends views all this as a way to funnel more businesses to building apps, offering in-app purchases, and promoting them with Apple’s advertising products. Marketing emails not working as well as they used to? Sounds like it’s time to buy some keywords in the App Store!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCet5h"&gt;And what of creators who want to move away from the ad model? Apple will be there, ready and waiting to take a 30 percent cut of Twitter Super Follows, paid podcasts, and ticketed Facebook events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xdt6y"&gt;It’s sometimes said that Amazon’s ultimate goal is to take a cut of all economic activity. Looking at Apple’s privacy moves this week, I’m mostly willing to take them at face value — as a necessary counter-balance to the inexorable rise of tracking technologies around the web. But it also seems clear that the value to Apple goes far beyond customer satisfaction — and as its revenues from ads and in-app purchases grow, we’d do well to keep an eye on how its policies are gradually reshaping the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple brought back the beloved magnifying glass for selecting text in iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJNnS9HAWzSLl1uJNOW2sgwHw_s=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424709/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="elQ9Cv"&gt;Apple’s text selection &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-brings-back-the-magnifying-glass-for-accurate-text-selection/"&gt;magnifying glass has reappeared&lt;/a&gt; in the iOS 15 beta, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22524824%2Fapple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s own site&lt;/a&gt; confirms its return by listing it as a feature. Bringing the feature back is a reversal from when Apple made the decision to dump it in iOS 13, which is a bit of a rare occurrence: Apple doesn’t usually go back after it’s done away with something (bringing back scissor switches in its keyboards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;after years of butterfly switches&lt;/a&gt; is a notable exception). The return of the little pop-up is welcome, though: I can only speak for myself, but since iOS 13’s release, I’ve constantly been struggling without the helpful little magnifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YC5WA3"&gt;The new version of the text magnifier seems to be a bit smaller than the old one (in case you’ve forgotten what it used to look like, you can see &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxapcquSZxs"&gt;a great demonstration here&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s at least better than the nothing that appears in iOS 13 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AaRxtd8kO_pa_upcMuglfrFOUiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645890/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_12.51.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The feature listing on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22524824%2Fapple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Did we not want to select exactly the text we wanted before?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="88e77i"&gt;It will, at the very least, solve the biggest problem with the current selection system: that your thumb is covering the text you’re trying to select, which makes it &lt;em&gt;a little difficult&lt;/em&gt; to see what’s being selected until you pick your thumb up from the screen. Then, if you’re like me, you’ll probably sigh seeing that the wrong thing is selected, then struggle with the text selection handles to try to highlight what you were actually going for (squinting at the small screen the whole time).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqoiEOLf3_erOksYOeME5AXIfyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645992/ios_14_selection_woes.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It isn’t always this bad, but iOS 14’s text selection leaves something to be desired (and that something is a magnifier).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k6t59P"&gt;iOS 15 is currently in early beta, so anything we see now is subject to change — Apple could always make the magnifying glass more prominent based on feedback, if it seems like a lot of people are still struggling. While this feature isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; enough for me to risk downloading the first developer beta, I think it may be what gets me to immediately grab the first public beta when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The six-year-old iPhone 6S will get iOS 15, and that rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bBUoFOzgTMz04ihhp5021RnhETM=/196x0:2305x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424126/iphone_6s_plus_clean_2_7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus arrived in September 2015 running iOS 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1ydGZS"&gt;The iPhone 6S will turn six years old this September, an eternity in phone years. If you’ve managed to hold onto one this long, then Apple has some good news for you — your phone will be eligible for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15 upgrade&lt;/a&gt; when it arrives for the public this fall. The iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and first-generation iPhone SE, which all shipped with iOS 9, will be among the oldest devices to receive the OS update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUWzSX"&gt;Six years is an awfully long life span for a mobile device, and certainly puts the 6S in the running for the longest supported phone to date. The iPhone 5S was five years old when it got its last OS update with iOS 12 but wasn’t eligible for iOS 13. On the Android side, Samsung has made recent moves to improve its device longevity by offering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security support&lt;/a&gt; for some of its phones. But six years of OS updates and security support puts the 6S in an entirely different league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAuOLa"&gt;To be sure, there are a lot of new features that won’t work with the 6S’s A9 Bionic processor. Features like the Google Lens-esque Visual Lookup, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; in photos, portrait mode in FaceTime, and immersive walking directions in Maps won’t be available to 6S users, since they all require a device with an A12 Bionic chip a la the XS and XR or later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vw84SQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple WWDC 2021: the 15 biggest announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6J0gyt"&gt;It’s also possible that newer software will slow down an older phone with an aging, less nimble processor. That might not necessarily be the case, though — both &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/ios-14-on-the-iphone-6s-and-se-performance-is-fine-other-stuff-is-not/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/ios14-older-iphones-3795531/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found no significant impact on performance running iOS 14 on the 6S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lS5T8p"&gt;What may be a bigger issue, as both testers noted, is that the 6S shows its age with poor battery life. Features like widgets are also tougher to use on the phone’s 4.7-inch screen, which is quaint compared to today’s standard six-inch-plus panels. These aren’t so much compatibility issues as the inevitable, slow march of time that no gadget can escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMJ1dL"&gt;iPhone 6S owners shouldn’t despair, though. They’ll still get potentially useful updates like notification summaries and Focus modes to minimize interruptions throughout the day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;video and music sharing&lt;/a&gt; in FaceTime, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"&gt;added privacy features&lt;/a&gt; like a seven-day app privacy report to keep tabs on how apps are using your information. There’s also the peace of mind that comes with running the latest OS version, and the security patches and bug fixes that come with it throughout the year. Not a bad deal for a six-year-old device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Screen Time to keep your iPhone use within healthy limits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F9j9UYVViDxjCj-v3bXiMEjYOLo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424084/bfarsace_201106_4269_026.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71fUVO"&gt;We all spend a lot of time on our phones, and it’s possible — just possible — that some of us spend too much time. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use"&gt;we ran an article&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to use what was then Apple’s brand-new Screen Time feature, which was built in order to help people keep their on-screen time in some sort of sane proportion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4g5Gbf"&gt;At the time (which was when iOS 12 came out), you could use Screen Time to check how much time you spent on your phone, use an App Limits feature to limit your (or your kids’) daily time spent on various apps or types of apps, or use its Downtime feature to cut off access to all (except a few) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odVZMI"&gt;Since then, and especially since iOS 13 came out, Screen Time has been expanded, making it easier to lock down apps and / or limit your screentime. (There have been no additional features announced so far for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;the upcoming iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll add them here if there are.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRN1jS"&gt;To begin using Screen Time, go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Screen Time.” Here are some of the things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m2VTij"&gt;Daily Average&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pmiNMf"&gt;At the top of the Screen Time app, you can see an accounting of your activity over the course of the day. Click on “See All Activity” to see a breakdown of which specific apps you used and how long you used them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your Screen Time screen is accessible from your Settings menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggA_yQU7yRGAjbRvvMF5Oyct128=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645210/IMG_5AFD8368F3A3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Screen Time screen is accessible from your Settings menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screen Time lets you know how long you’ve been on your phone, and with which apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1PUC2UJiLMEeGJQvp2iQ6NVrKWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645212/IMG_B722454A795A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Time lets you know how long you’ve been on your phone, and with which apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9a4phx"&gt;Downtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr76BG"&gt;Downtime lets you set periods when you want to force yourself to give your eyes a rest and avoid staring at the screen. It does this by locking down the apps with which you are most likely to spend time. These lockdowns are not absolute — as you’ll see later, you can cancel Downtime when you need to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztlSvG"&gt;Begin by choosing when you want to start your time away from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jGPz2g"&gt;Tap on “Downtime” and toggle it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ULynqq"&gt;Select the days (it can be every day or just on specific days) and times that you want to avoid getting swallowed by your favorite iPhone apps. During those times, only specified apps that you pre-selected (along with phone calls) will be allowed through. For example, you can disable Facebook and Twitter during working hours, but keep the Messages app going for texts. (We’ll go over how to choose which apps to disable in a moment.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6xpbLB"&gt;You’ll get a warning before Downtime kicks in. If you need to keep working on an app, don’t worry — you’ll be given the chance to ask for one more minute, to be reminded in another 15 minutes, or to ignore the limit for today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can set Downtime for everyday or specific days, and for set times for each day" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdFBe_H4X6SF5P9swk0plrwrUus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645426/IMG_5D6CBD759B26_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set Downtime for every day or specific days, and for set times for each day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apps can be flagged as always allowed, even during Downtime." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pADXaUsGVY4ryDYQtUOAo0mAl8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645432/IMG_9FECEC603727_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps can be flagged as always allowed, even during Downtime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yIbF9r"&gt;Keep in mind that Downtime, and the other Screen Time features, can be applied to all your devices that use iCloud. So if you set it on your iPhone, for example, it can apply to your Mac or iPad as well. To share your settings across your devices, go to the Screen Time main screen and toggle “Share Across Devices” on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyrjeu"&gt;Now that you’ve chosen &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you want some downtime, you’ll probably want to select &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; apps should be allowed to remain active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dtarU"&gt;Back in the Screen Time main screen, select “Always Allowed.” Here you can choose which apps you will still have access to during downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cuuooE"&gt;You’ll see two sets of apps: Allowed Apps and Choose Apps. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ifFL5P"&gt;To select an app you’ll always want access to, even during downtime, tap on the app’s name in Choose Apps and it will appear in the Allowed Apps list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w2QVxh"&gt;If you want to disallow any of the Allowed Apps, tap on the minus sign next to the app, and then on “Remove.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FqNQvs"&gt;There are more ways to personalize Downtime. Let’s say you want to get alerted about text messages from specific people — you’re planning to concentrate on a project and don’t want to hear from any of your friends, but you still want to get texts from family members. You can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SDiM1O"&gt;On the same “Always Allowed” page, tap on “Contacts” at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ElBJnY"&gt;Under “Allowed Communication,” select “Specific Contacts” and choose which contacts you want to allow through, even during downtime. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2NpCxn"&gt;Note that the “Allowed Communication” page is also accessible from the main Screen Time page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gpVsFE"&gt;App Limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WJAgoC"&gt;Another way to keep your app use in check is to limit the amount of time you use an app (rather than setting what time of day you can use it). For example, if Twitter tends to be your personal black hole, you can decide not to spend more than, say, two hours on Twitter each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxdU0L"&gt;To set your app limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D2hPC7"&gt;In the Screen Time screen, select “App Limits” &amp;gt; “Add Limit.” Toggle “App Limits” on and tap on “Add Limit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4taRzN"&gt;You’ll see a list of categories, such as “Social,” “Games,” and “Entertainment.” Tap on a specific category, and it will open up to show a list of all your apps that are in that category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To limit the amount of time you use an app, select App Limits." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0HVgNG7TqpIvA2ZJEajF91Ze8Ts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645260/IMG_0AC0E116FFC1_1.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hSDXif"&gt;Select the apps that you want to limit — or select an entire category to choose all the apps in that category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dcKdTv"&gt;Tap on “Next” in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L3Mu3i"&gt;Select the maximum amount of time you can use the app(s) on a daily basis. When you reach your limit, you’ll be interrupted by a screen that lets you either apply the limit (just tap on the “OK” button), or shrug and select “Ignore Limit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ymh75o"&gt;If you choose the latter, you can get one more minute, ask to be reminded in 15 minutes, or decide to ignore the limit for today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose how much time you want to spend on an app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bKfJy4XokyLHBVGjX8EnbofR02c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645275/IMG_63420372C935_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose how much time you want to spend on an app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you hit your time limit, you can ask for more time, or ignore it altogether." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-qXntlLlTVEGUdOsPRZCtrWWpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645285/IMG_7424C1B86747_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you hit your time limit, you can ask for more time or ignore it altogether.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r6JZtS"&gt;Note: if for any reason you don’t want to use an app at all, except for on rare occasions, you can set the Screen Time to 23 hours and 59 minutes. The app will then be out of reach unless you go back into “Settings” &amp;gt; “Screen Time” &amp;gt; “App Limits” and disable the limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dvoc84"&gt;Screen Time Passcode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tDNcaj"&gt;If you want to keep certain apps out of the reach of your kids — or your roommate — then you can create a passcode that will be needed to make any changes to Screen Time. The passcode is also useful if you feel you need an extra barrier before you undo one of your limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1NcJMg"&gt;Go to Screen Time and tap on “Use Screen Time Passcode.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FS0GOB"&gt;Set a four-digit passcode, and then reenter it when asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bsAy9X"&gt;Enter your Apple ID and password so that you can use it if you’ve forgotten your passcode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uVVIrR"&gt;And that’s it. If you want to change or delete your passcode, go back to Screen Time and select “Change Screen Time Passcode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LN0t9l"&gt;Content &amp;amp; Privacy Restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="carjbn"&gt;The last selection in Screen Time isn’t as much concerned with when you use your iPhone as with what you see or hear on it. Select “Content &amp;amp; Privacy Restrictions” if you want to allow or restrict explicit content, keep TV shows or movies to certain ratings, set an age limit for apps, limit which websites are allowed, and set a number of different limits on games (such as multiplayer games, connecting with friends, or private messaging). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql5dhD"&gt;Most of this is geared toward parents who want to oversee what their kids see and hear online, but if you’d rather avoid accidentally crashing into any “adult” websites, it could be useful. There are also a number of privacy features, such as stopping Apple advertising, or not allowing apps to change the settings of your microphone, Bluetooth sharing, and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

    <title>macOS and tvOS are getting spatial audio support with the AirPods Pro and Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cldvICuW5DevDXGBeqxPhGZAFA8=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69423054/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_10.48.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbWXbF"&gt;Apple is extending support for spatial audio to macOS and tvOS. The feature will work with the company’s high-end AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, using the devices’ built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes to create a 3D audio effect that tracks the listener’s head movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KziSGB"&gt;Apple initially announced spatial audio for the AirPods Pro last year and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;impressed us with the feature’s immersive quality&lt;/a&gt;. At this year’s WWDC, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;extended support for spatial audio to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjAYV5"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fmacos-monterey-introduces-powerful-features-to-get-more-done%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22523914%2Fmacos-tvos-spatial-audio-support-airpods-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from Apple, spatial audio for macOS will only work with the AirPods Pro and Max on Macs with the company’s latest M1 chip and the macOS Monterey operating system. During this week’s WWDC &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0TD96VTf0Xs?t=2357"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;, Apple said spatial audio would arrive on tvOS sometime “this fall,” offering a “full-surround experience” and “dynamic head tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IrFYs"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/tvos-and-macos-will-get-spatial-audio-support-for-airpods-pro-and-max"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that spatial audio on tvOS will only work with the Apple TV 4K, and it’s not clear what apps on the Apple TV will support the feature. Or when support for spatial audio through other headphones on either platform will be available. We’ve reached out to Apple to find out more and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple came this close to bringing back the away message</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_weZ8TMiDw0Fnx8UrfKhFb2FtvY=/136x0:1600x976/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69422391/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_8.28.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;So close!&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xrI1Jg"&gt;Apple has a habit of, if not innovating outright, then at least presenting the most polished version of existing ideas. Its Universal Control, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;for instance&lt;/a&gt;, is basically a Logitech thing, done beautifully. One of its announcements at WWDC yesterday missed that mark but came achingly close to bringing back a defining feature of the dial-up days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a22Xid"&gt;The announcement in question is, of course, Focus, a new set of features meant to help iPhone users let people know when they are not to be bothered. “It turns out, it’s even easier to step away and focus if people know we’re busy,” Apple’s SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi said. “So we created an easy way to signal to others when you’re doing that.” Focus solves the problem of either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="2lT1D2"&gt;Leaving notifications on and being annoyed at all times by unnecessary messages or &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kcT9IW"&gt;Turning them off, then later explaining to the disbelieving sender that you weren’t purposefully ignoring them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="idJRF3"&gt;As you might recall, though, there’s some historical precedent for a feature that communicates being “away” from your device in the form of a “message” — built right into AOL Instant Messenger almost a quarter-century ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGwcpA"&gt;Here’s a quote: “[It] was the classic finding a solution to a very personal problem: nobody’s answering, what does that mean?” I’ll let you guess if that comes from Apple’s Federighi or AOL’s former design director JoRoan Lazaro. (&lt;a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/an-oral-history-of-the-aim-away-message-by-the-people-who-were-there/"&gt;Answer here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIl8qD"&gt;AIM was, for a very long time, a hugely successful product. So what’s the issue? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p551n0"&gt;While away messages allowed a level of customization in what non-active users communicated to their friends (anything from specific reasons they were unavailable to ASCII art or song lyrics), Apple’s version merely states “[name] has notifications silenced with Focus.” Yes, focus is capitalized. Instead of using a new feature to gently tell a friend “Sorry, I’m a little in the weeds right now, but I want to hear what you have to say later,” the branded, capitalized Focus feels like I’ve hired Apple as a bouncer to tell my pals to piss off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2P825"&gt;To give Federighi the benefit of the doubt, AIM didn’t start with away status customization. In the &lt;a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/an-oral-history-of-the-aim-away-message-by-the-people-who-were-there/"&gt;same oral history&lt;/a&gt; as the above quote, AIM’s former VP of community Eric Bosco said: “The away message started out as a canned status—‘I’m away’—on the internal IM platform. But then we realized that still wasn’t that helpful. It didn’t specify where you were away to [...] So we thought why not make it more freeform text.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiRQIO"&gt;Fingers crossed that Apple will come to the same realization in the several months between the developer beta of iOS 15 (now) and its public release (sometime this fall). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Universal Control on macOS Monterey works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hjXvpD3Wka_uxHblUCGjZnstu4=/219x0:2472x1502/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69421548/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.07.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9iIM9X"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;best moment&lt;/a&gt; of this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC keynote&lt;/a&gt; was a straightforward demo of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS feature&lt;/a&gt;, Universal Control. The idea is simple enough: it allows you to use the keyboard and trackpad on a Mac to directly control an iPad, and even makes it simple to drag and drop content between those devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwaDPf"&gt;What made the demo so impressive is how easy and seamless it all seemed. In a classic Apple move, there was no setup required at all. The segment happened so fast that it even seemed (incorrectly, as it turns out) like the Mac was able to physically locate the iPad in space so it knew where to put the mouse pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZO9np"&gt;After Zaprudering the clip and asking Apple a few questions, I now have a better understanding of what’s going on here. It turns out that the entire system is actually simpler than it first appears. It’s essentially a new way to use a bunch of technologies Apple had already developed. That’s not a knock on Universal Control — sometimes the best software features are a result of clever thinking instead of brute force technological improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRbIal"&gt;So here’s what’s happening in that demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtq4BY"&gt;First, you need to get the iPad and Mac relatively close to each other. Universal Control is built off the same Continuity and Handoff features that have long been a part of iOS and macOS. When the devices are close enough, their Bluetooth modules let each other know. Of course, all the devices here need to be on the same iCloud account for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTh0Dr"&gt;Then, you start up Universal Control by dragging your mouse pointer all the way to the left or right edge of your Mac’s screen, then a little bit &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; that edge. When you do, the Mac will assume that you’re trying to drag the mouse over to another device, in this case the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2i0wSI"&gt;So there’s no UWB location detection, just good old assumption. One note is that if you have lots of compatible devices, Monterey assumes that you’re dragging towards the last iPad or Mac you interacted with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cAKru"&gt;At this point, a Wi-Fi Direct connection is made and the iPad will show a small bar on the side with a little bump. It’s a sort of indicator that the iPad is aware you’re trying to drag a mouse into it. Keep dragging and pow, the bump breaks free into a circular mouse pointer. When the mouse is on the iPad screen, both it and the keyboard on your Mac control the iPad. Move it back to the Mac, and you control the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zsXlTvQVI3QlVlJyuvC0euUGN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644352/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_7.37.19_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FzsBpE"&gt;But there’s a clever little affordance built into that strange bar. There are a couple of arrows inside it, a hint that you can slide that bump up or down before it breaks free into the iPad itself. Doing that is how you line up the iPad’s screen with your Mac’s, so that dragging the mouse between the screens doesn’t result in a weird jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPMi9i"&gt;You go through the same process to set up a second device with Universal Control — it maxes out at three. If all this automatic setup sounds like a hassle, you can just go into system preferences and set a device as your preferred Universal Control buddy gadget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wedQp1"&gt;However you set it up, you can drag and drop content between devices and it’ll use either Wi-Fi Direct or USB to transfer the files. Of course, if you’re dragging files into the iPad, make sure you have an app open (like Files) that can accept it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8ydbY"&gt;That’s pretty much the long and the short of it. There are still some details to hash out, Apple tells me, and it isn’t available in the first developer preview. If you put your dock on the left or right edge of the screen, for example, it’s unclear if this whole setup will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yv8GjH"&gt;What’s fascinating to me about this system — as I discuss in the video above — is that it’s only really possible because of a long series of software enhancements that have been built into the iPad over the years, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="ltFF7z"&gt;Continuity, Handoff, and AirDrop. Universal Control isn’t technically AirDrop, but it’s the same basic idea. All of these are the basic ways that Apple devices communicate directly with each other instead of through the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jaBZCN"&gt;Multitasking. I’m not referring to split-screen, but the support for drag-and-drop that came along with the improved windowing options on the iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j4pJPz"&gt;Keyboard and mouse support. That’s an obvious pre-requisite, but it wasn’t always obvious that Apple would put mouse support into the iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sM5K02"&gt;Sidecar. Sidecar’s the tool that lets you use an iPad as a second Mac monitor. I don’t think that Universal Control uses the same bits of software as Sidecar, but I do think that there were probably lessons there about latency that would prove useful here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="HCXPrd"&gt;I had a hunch that there would be a similar story of evolution on the Mac side of this story. I figured that all the iPad and iOS technologies finding their way into the Mac with the last few releases played a part. Catalyst apps turned into native iPad apps for M1 Macs. Control Center, Shortcuts, and Focus mode all are iOS things that are also on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLzZpF"&gt;Nice idea, but wrong. Apple tells me that the foundation on the Mac side is as simple as it seems, based on Continuity and Handoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0BQA8"&gt;I hope that Universal Control works as well in the real world as it did in this staged demo — and I know that’s no sure thing. But what I like about the feature is how it’s just a clever recombination of existing technologies that Apple had already built for other purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxJMO0"&gt;Inside the Apple ecosystem, you expect that the trade you’re making for only using Apple devices is getting synergistic integrations like this. They’ve actually been rarer than I would have guessed the past few years. But as the Mac and the iPad start trading more and more features with each other, I expect we’ll see more of them going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s privacy-focused Private Relay feature isn’t coming to China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FCCcszVbQIMAVAczbYw8rwNtDus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420969/acastro_180227_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RyoW5M"&gt;Apple’s new Private Relay feature, which is designed to obscure users’ browsing data and protect their privacy, won’t be available in China, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apples-new-private-relay-feature-will-not-be-available-china-2021-06-07/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature was announced during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference as part of a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;subscription bundle called iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Other countries where Private Relay won’t be available include: Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2Cbi9"&gt;The move is the latest concession Apple has made in order to offer its services in China, a market which &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes accounts for almost 15 percent of its revenue. Chinese citizens’ access to the internet is heavily regulated, and there is restricted access to technologies like virtual private networks, or VPNs, which help citizens evade tracking and bypass censorship. It’s worth noting that Apple isn’t itself calling Private Relay a VPN, citing technicalities in how it operates, but the service protects users’ privacy in a similar way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3VNHGP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;China is one of ten countries not getting the feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TcNs4M"&gt;In 2018, Apple started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/26/17052802/apple-icloud-encryption-keys-storage-china"&gt;storing some iCloud encryption keys in China&lt;/a&gt; and transferred its Chinese iCloud operations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/28/17055088/apple-chinese-icloud-accounts-government-privacy-speed"&gt;to a firm located in China&lt;/a&gt;. Although Apple said the move would improve the “&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/10/apple-will-begin-storing-chinese-customer-icloud-data-at-new-china-data-center-from-next-month/"&gt;speed and reliability of iCloud,&lt;/a&gt;” critics said it would also let Chinese authorities access user data through the country’s legal system. The previous year, Apple removed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/29/16062172/apple-chinese-app-store-vpn-censorship-crackdown"&gt;several major VPN apps&lt;/a&gt; from its App Store in China in response to local regulations requiring VPN providers to have a government license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IRER6"&gt;According to Apple, Private Relay encrypts a user’s traffic and sends it through two internet relays in such a way that no entity can see the contents of a user’s browsing data. A first Apple-controlled relay assigns a user an anonymous IP address, while a second third-party relay decrypts the web address and forwards the data on to its destination. Apple says Private Relay hides a user’s traffic from ISPs, advertisers, and even Apple itself.&lt;/p&gt;
