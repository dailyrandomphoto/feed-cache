    <title>Apple’s new M1 Max MacBook Pro may get a virtual turbo button for High Power Mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krArQY3jBfR0B6ySC0B94G31n3w=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029214/lcimg_2d0f1c7f_4824_4e90_b501_7d917bcd4ae2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NUm69G"&gt;Apple wants you to think of its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"&gt;M1 Max MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; as a beast of a machine — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tobL8U7dQo"&gt;it actually calls it a “beast” in the ad&lt;/a&gt; — but it seems the upcoming macOS Monterey, which ships alongside the new Macs, will unleash its full potential. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;contributor Steve Moser has discovered a new “High Power Mode” in the operating system’s recent beta release that can “optimize performance to better support resource intensive tasks,” and apparently, spin up the fan to compensate for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="828eeI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Found more information on the high power power mode in the macOS RC: “Your Mac will optimize performance to better support resource-intensive tasks. This may result in louder fan noise.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/4q3zlbyLnf"&gt;https://t.co/4q3zlbyLnf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0mKVekGa0M"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0mKVekGa0M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1450272709787766793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cWiJkc"&gt;Remember when some powerful laptops came with a physical turbo button or slider? Sounds like Apple does! (Though you can certainly emulate this sort of thing by playing with power modes and fan curves on many Windows machines as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRrP1S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; says the new feature is exclusive to the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max, even though it’s possible to configure a 14-inch MacBook Pro with that chip as well. It also apparently won’t work with the M1 Pro or original M1 models, so you’re looking at laptops with a starting price of $3,099 and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AReM2A"&gt;It’ll be interesting to see whether this High Power Mode unlocks additional performance, or whether it’s actually required to see the kinds of results the company claimed on stage for prolonged periods of time. Apple’s had occasional issues with thermal throttling in the past, such as in 2018 when a Core i9 MacBook Pros wound up slower than the Core i7 version under sustained loads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17605652/macbook-pro-thermal-throttling-apple-software-fix"&gt;though Apple said that particular issue was down to a bug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17611266/apple-macbook-pro-review-2018-core-i9-15-inch"&gt;fixed it with an update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b336qd"&gt;Apple’s paying a lot of attention to thermals these days. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt;The single biggest difference between the 2020 M1 MacBook Air and 2020 M1 MacBook Pro was a fan&lt;/a&gt;, and it was a meaningful difference, because the extra thermal headroom meant the Pro could sustain peak performance for longer. That’s why I won’t be surprised if this high power mode is exclusive to the 16-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit took a peek underneath the Apple Watch Series 7’s larger display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 7 teardown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQtiqu6CTaHpkru5HduODV1SUKA=/0x245:5843x4140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029041/Apple_Watch_S7_21_guide_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 teardown | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/53688/three-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYGSz2"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;our review of the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Dieter Bohn called it the best smartwatch while noting the new model’s changes as “smaller iterations” year-over-year than we previously expected. Even those small improvements required some reengineering. To appreciate those efforts, the folks from&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F53688%2Fthree-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F21%2F22738876%2Fapple-watch-series-7-teardown-ifixit-diagnostic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; iFixit teamed up with former Apple engineers to investigate the new parts&lt;/a&gt; and get some insight into how the changes came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fJoxT4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2lD2llGLJzk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmSg7r"&gt;Ex-Apple product designer Tobias is now with &lt;a href="https://instrumental.com/about?utm_medium=Network&amp;amp;utm_source=Partner%20Referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Content&amp;amp;utm_group=ifixit&amp;amp;utm_subgroup="&gt;Instrumental&lt;/a&gt;. He points out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lD2llGLJzk"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt; that by looking at the back of the display, we can see that for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Apple removed a ribbon cable, combining touch and display signals into one cable instead of two. That helped shrink the device’s bezels, but Tobias says in a video that he’s “fairly certain” the complexity of that change and how it rippled through the supply chain is the reason why this Watch was slightly delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYGtzD"&gt;A more surprising moment is when they found out that the Apple Watch Series 6 battery fits in, and works with, the newer model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDSNXT"&gt;Of course, another element of the teardown is what’s not inside the new Apple Watch — an old diagnostic port. Since the earliest versions, it had been hiding inside the watch’s wristband groove, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690061/apple-watch-series-7-wireless-dock-data-transfer-port-free"&gt;now Apple has replaced it with wireless technology&lt;/a&gt;. Is this a hint at an iPhone without ports? We can’t tell yet, but the teardown will show you how everything came together to make the device less susceptible to cracking, better at resisting dust and water, and just that tiny bit better than the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rare Apple VideoPad prototype scrapped by Steve Jobs set to be auctioned</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An open Apple VideoPad in front of a blank background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_b6YXjP-hLqffBgOqs-LLAImHY=/0x63:960x703/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028461/AppleVideoPad.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple VideoPad 2 | Photo: Bonhams&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dv50OY"&gt;The long-lost Apple VideoPad 2 prototype is &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/55/"&gt;going up for auction in November&lt;/a&gt; as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/"&gt;History of Science and Technology auction&lt;/a&gt; by Bonhams, an international auction house, in Los Angeles. The VideoPad will be auctioned alongside other Apple prototypes and Steve Jobs memorabilia and is estimated to sell between $8,000 and $12,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2lwN2"&gt;Developed between 1993 and 1995 with VideoPad 1 and 3 (the only two examples shown to the public), this only surviving PDA prototype was Apple’s next attempt after the Newton Message Pad. Unlike the Newton Message Pad, the fold-up screen apparently included a built-in camera for video conferencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNNu9o"&gt;Despite being designed to be ahead of its time, it was canceled along with Newton OS after Jobs’ return to the company in 1997. &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/55/"&gt;According to Bonhams&lt;/a&gt;, that was after Jobs realized the technology was not yet at the level required for a positive user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J09er5"&gt;The device was produced from conceptual design sketches drawn by former CEO John Sculley. The design never made it to the public, but it was a super early vision for a tablet, and if you squint, you can see a line drawn between it and successful devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083369/apple-ipad-10-years-launch-steve-jobs-tablet-market"&gt;the iPhone and iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mythic Quest has been renewed for a third and fourth season on Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZesWIdHd6kd8wvk5PDQMwHjrSGw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027359/Apple_TV_Mythic_Quest_key_art.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6LIYC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/10/apple-tv-doubles-down-on-mythic-quest-renewing-acclaimed-workplace-comedy-for-seasons-three-and-four/"&gt;renewed for a third and fourth season&lt;/a&gt; on Apple TV Plus, Apple announced today, marking the biggest commitment yet to one of its streaming originals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HkIjX"&gt;The show stars Rob McElhenney (who co-created the series) as Ian Grimm, the ambitious and self-centered creative director of a popular fictional video game, along with Charlotte Nicdao as Poppy Li, the lead engineer and co-creative director who works — and often fights — with Grimm over the direction of the titular &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; game. The show’s ensemble cast also features Murray Abraham, Danny Pudi, Imani Hakim, Ashly Burch, Jessie Ennis, and David Hornsby as members of the game’s development, creative, and testing teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MAJnul"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BREAKING: Big announcement from Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jason Sudeikis (and Ron something) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MythicQuest?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MythicQuest&lt;/a&gt; is returning for Seasons 3 &amp;amp; 4 &lt;a href="https://t.co/OugCaIWwjv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OugCaIWwjv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Apple TV (@AppleTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV/status/1451243133031915521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gd876H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;’s first season debuted on Apple TV Plus in February 2020, but Apple had already ordered the second season before the show even aired. Since then, the series has become one of Apple TV Plus’ biggest hits and, with today’s announcement, will be the first Apple-created show to be ordered for a fourth season so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aR1o4A"&gt;Apple’s announcement didn’t put an exact timing for &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;’s third season beyond a “2022” date, although the company did note that it would arrive “before Ted Lasso season three.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeOs0o"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Regulators demand more info about tech payment systems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A closeup photograph of an Indian man in a blue business suit, his collar just barely visible." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nbuFJSPfh4dFr0Y16Bx3iLapxDU=/0x0:4951x3301/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026521/1176565198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CFBP Director Rohit Chopra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mx18fp"&gt;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has issued a series of information-gathering orders on the business practices of major digital payments systems. Orders were issued to Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, PayPal, and Square, the bureau said in an announcement on Thursday morning. Chinese pay systems operated by WeChat and AliPay will also be studied but are not subject to any CFBP orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofUkWp"&gt;Issued as part of the CFPB’s investigative authority, the orders are not an indication of specific wrongdoing, but they suggest the CFPB will be taking a more active role in regulating tech companies’ consumer products in the future. In particular, they are meant to root out any data collection or anti-competitive conduct that may have not yet come to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1J1or"&gt;The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ce2B1j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Will the payment platforms be truly neutral?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c89uVx"&gt;In a statement, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra framed the orders as an effort to ensure tech companies were not using the power of payment processing to exploit consumers or gain an anti-competitive advantage over smaller firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBI2sR"&gt;“Little is known publicly about how Big Tech companies will exploit their payments platforms,” Chopra said in a statement announcing the queries. “For example, will the operators engage in invasive financial surveillance and combine the data they collect on consumers with their geolocation and browsing data?... Will the payment platforms be truly neutral, or will they use their scale to extract rents from market participants?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMPpDf"&gt;Previously an FTC commissioner, Chopra worked closely with current FTC Chair Lina Khan, and the new investigation is meant to harmonize with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690176/ftc-chair-lina-khan-focus-antitrust-consumer-amazon"&gt;the FTC’s ongoing tech antitrust efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwtBNl"&gt;The orders are already drawing applause from antitrust advocates, including the American Economic Liberties project. “The CFPB’s orders will force Big Tech to come clean on their surveillance, data collection, and payments systems,” the group said in a statement, “and provide regulators another important window in their sprawling empires.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple still won’t mandate vaccines but will require employees to regularly take COVID-19 tests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQrzhAXr3SfckiQIdgUZ7X-X4Gk=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026134/B2E53F34_14F4_4895_AECA_E72D86070E7C.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fcpkIi"&gt;Apple is tightening its COVID-19 policies, requiring that unvaccinated employees (or employees who refuse to disclose their vaccination status) get daily COVID-19 tests to enter its offices, although the company still has yet to require workers to get vaccinated. Vaccinated employees will also have to do regular tests, but only once a week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/apple-will-force-unvaccinated-office-workers-to-get-tested-daily?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAC851"&gt;Retail workers at Apple Stores will also have to regularly test, although at a lower rate than other Apple employees: unvaccinated store workers will have to take tests twice per week, with vaccinated workers getting tested once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ant7NO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google, Microsoft, and Facebook all require in-person employees to be vaccinated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9uVSGn"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple has asked its employees to submit proof of vaccination by October 24th, ahead of the new testing requirements kicking in on November 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T634xv"&gt;And while the move does mark a slightly stronger push by Apple to get its employees vaccinated, it still falls short of actually requiring employees to get vaccinated. Apple is one of the largest major tech companies that hasn’t instituted a mandate yet, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607690/microsoft-proof-vaccination-covid-19-us-buildings-office-reopening"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; all requiring that in-person employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 to enter their offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DInOFI"&gt;Apple’s new requirements also after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666508/biden-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;President Joe Biden’s announcement of plans&lt;/a&gt; to establish new OSHA standards that would require companies with more than 100 employees (which Apple certainly falls under) to ensure employees either are vaccinated against COVID-19 or conducting weekly testing, something Apple’s new requirements would meet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2021 iPad Pro has dropped to its lowest price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPad Pro is great for video editing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UkLkxjCBbLqTt4uOChrjSfqPs-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020067/vpavic_210512_4592_0110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can save $200 on the 2021 iPad Pro today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Kayla Murkison / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e8wy1U"&gt;If you can’t wait to get your hands on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733406/macbook-pro-13-14-16-inch-m1-max-air-compare-specs"&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, check out this great iPad Pro deal, which will certainly keep you distracted in the meantime. Today &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray/385211636&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22498921%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Walmart, you can save $200&lt;/a&gt; on this upgraded 12.9-inch model that has 256GB of storage. Typically $1,199, the retailer is offering the Wi-Fi-only version in space gray for $999 instead, which is an appealing price since it’s the current cost of the 128GB version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWJfvT"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we praised the iPad Pro’s beautiful Mini LED screen, the fast M1 processor, and the Center Stage camera, which follows faces while you make video calls. The iPad also offers good dual rear cameras that are paired with lidar, excellent microphones, support for the second-gen Apple Pencil, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZdRwfE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NOpvli"&gt;Android phone owners feeling left out while the tech world goes nuts over the latest AirPods 3, fear not: we’ve got something for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gC5zXR"&gt;Samsung’s entry-level wireless &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight/dp/B0942DM32W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; are the company’s smallest and lightest true wireless earbuds yet. Typically $150, right now Amazon is selling them for $130, the lowest price it’s offered on the well-reviewed earbuds yet. The discount applies to all styles, ranging from white and graphite to olive green. You can also add a Galaxy SmartTag, paying $155 in total instead of the $180 that it usually costs to buy both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUZRFZ"&gt;We loved that it offers features like active noise cancellation, wireless charging, and a small, low-profile design with good audio quality and performance. It’s so good and affordable that, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we predicted it would become the default pick for many Android users — especially when the sales start to hit, which it seems they are. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vXnixU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jQ08n2"&gt;Razer’s Basilisk V2 wired gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;one of the best mice you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s already a good deal in and of itself, offering many of the features that comes with the more expensive Basilisk Ultimate, Razer’s wireless version, but for an affordable price. Today, however, it’s a better deal given you can get it for over half off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irxDLw"&gt;Typically $80, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082G5BDNC/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPnd39G8ta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the mouse for $35 instead. For a nearly 60 percent discount, you can buy a mouse that offers a scroll wheel with adjustable tension, tactile buttons, a thin SpeedFlex cable, customizable LEDs, and fast performance. What’s more, Best Buy is also throwing in $10 off a three-month digital subscription to Xbox Game Pass for PC when you buy it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s8e5U1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bxVsxx"&gt;You can currently grab a pair of the Jabra Elite 75t earbuds for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfEmv2ecW#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Jabra has since released an updated version of these earbuds, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Jabra Elite 3&lt;/a&gt;, but we still consider the 75t to be a decent alternative to the AirPods, thanks to their solid sound quality and comfortable design. These earbuds come in black or gray and can last a little over five hours on a single charge. The on-ear mics can be used for calls, as well as for summoning Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant — and you can connect them to two devices at once, an unusual feature for this price. The matte-finished case can hold an extra 18 hours of juice and can be topped off via USB-C. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HYXLcL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5SPZ8U"&gt;Another fine deal is on a curved gaming monitor, this time for the lowest price ever. You can currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO4JTzLnAq#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $150 on the Samsung CRG5 curved gaming monitor at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $399.99, it costs $249.99. The CRG5 has a 27-inch 1080p panel with a 240Hz refresh rate and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, both of which should provide stellar performance in the gaming space that's tough to match at this price. The monitor has HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, but it lacks support for peripheral USB connectivity. Another small pain point is the stand, which has limited adjustment options. Though the CRG5 does have a built-in 75 x 75 VESA mount if you need to make the panel more suitable for your desk setup.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P0C0fE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10816293"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5wi7Os"&gt;Dell’s Alienware lineup may have greater curb appeal, but the Dell G15 brings similar performance, just without the extraterrestrial aesthetic. Right now, you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO4Uf74Sb2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $270 on this excellent gaming laptop at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It costs $880 instead of its usual $1,150 price. This 15-inch laptop manages to pack in a Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, an Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti, and a 512GB SSD. These specs should provide excellent performance for the 1080p high-refresh panel on the G15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SQrNyL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10816306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ieW5Na"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Best Gaming Laptop in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cnKbBq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is turning 10, and you’re invited to the party taking place in New York City on the 22nd and 23rd of October (that’s this weekend!). On The Verge is going to be a celebration of everything we’ve accomplished over the past decade, and we want you to be a part of it. Right now you can &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/evite" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;snag tickets for just $99 with the &lt;strong&gt;promo code $99NOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which gets you admission for both days and four complimentary drink tickets. The event will include speakers from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and from the wider world of tech, as well as musical performances and interactive experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fzmXLk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>PSA: the MacBook Pro 14-inch’s $20 power brick upsell is probably worth it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NIO_tKL0ve33zAqcLcjYg4abcPg=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018348/lcimg_f1ce43fd_90a7_4584_bc4f_63c9935d516b.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dSAcBZ"&gt;If you’re looking at buying the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;$1,999 base model MacBook Pro 14-inch&lt;/a&gt;, there’s one upgrade that you may really want to make — the $20 one that gets you the 96W power adapter instead of the 67W included power adapter. That’s because, according to some wording on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-gray-8-core-cpu-14-core-gpu-512gb#"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Pro configuration page&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-67w-adapter-cant-fast-charge/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll need the more powerful charger if you want to take advantage of the computer’s fast charging feature, which can charge the laptop up to 50 percent in half an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="om07HD"&gt;Is it ridiculous that Apple is basically taxing the people who want to buy its least expensive (but still very pricey!) new MacBook Pro? Yes, absolutely — but you should still probably pay it if you want to charge your laptop up quickly. The exception is if you already have a charging brick capable of 100W USB-PD power delivery: Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that you can fast charge via Thunderbolt as long as your power brick provides enough power. If you already have a beefy power brick, you can skip the upsell.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MVvDLva6vYe47MyboXqOnpcfEkM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940510/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_3.41.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This may be the best $20 you can spend on an accessory for your new MacBook Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qZIY2O"&gt;I know it probably doesn’t feel great to encourage Apple’s nickel-and-diming, but if you want fast charging, this will likely be the best way to get it. There may be, somewhere in the world, a 100W USB-PD charging brick that sells for $20, but there’s no way I would trust it enough to charge a very expensive computer. (If it was $20, I might not even trust it not to burn down my house). I’d pick the upsell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjWk18"&gt;The one silver lining is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;this is only a problem on the base 8 CPU core / 14 GPU core model&lt;/a&gt; — if you do any processor upgrades, you’ll get the 96W brick for “free.” Please note, though, that upgrading just the RAM and/or storage on the base MacBook Pro won’t get you that upgrade, but if you’re in the configuration screen anyways, you should absolutely check that box unless you hate fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel 6 doesn’t come with five years of Android updates — only three</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSPoNXX5eOm7F6oh4iKbTkaetyA=/152x0:1768x1077/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018216/qMm7BP1Fye.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VerlUH"&gt;For the first time ever, Google’s new phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;are powered by a Google-designed chip&lt;/a&gt;, giving the company an Apple-like level of control over the inner workings of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.&lt;/a&gt; But if you were hoping that meant they’d also get an Apple-like level of new OS updates, the company is throwing a bit of cold water on that. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#zippy=%2Cpixel-xl-a-a-xl-xl-a-a-g-a-g%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-phones"&gt;Google’s support page shows it’s only promising&lt;/a&gt; to offer Android updates through October 2024 (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-6-three-years-os-updates-five-years-security-patches/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;), &lt;/em&gt;a total of three years after release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4ikZY"&gt;“Users will still get at least 3 years of OS updates, after which we’re committing to ensure that Pixels will stay up-to-date and secure,” Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The frequency and categories of updates will depend on the capabilities and needs of the hardware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7M9vCk"&gt;While Google prominently announced during its Tuesday keynote that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro would get five years of &lt;em&gt;security&lt;/em&gt; updates — two years more! — it seems that Android version updates (like Android 11, Android 12, etc) are another story. And though Google is technically saying it will offer new versions of Android until “at least” October 2024, the company hasn’t historically gone above and beyond those sorts of promises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qv8tNy"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility"&gt;the six-year-old iPhone 6S recently got an update to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is ready to admit it was wrong about the future of laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m12jFAfSID_WEfiedS0EpLEa7mE=/1x0:1911x1273/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017538/Apple_MacBook_Pro_Ports_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports, ports, glorious ports.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hjCdN"&gt;There’s plenty to be excited about when it comes to Apple’s new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros. As well as souped-up Pro and Max versions of the already capable M1 chip that Apple debuted last year, they also include numerous quality of life improvements like the return of MagSafe, a row of function keys rather than an OLED Touch Bar, and of course, a full selection of ports that won’t have users reaching for a dongle if they just want to import some photos from an SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYTmsh"&gt;In fact, Apple was so enthusiastic about these “new” features, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that it was the one that killed most of them off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CN7cuC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple finally listened to the pros","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ecOgaI"&gt;“Users value the full-height function row on the standalone Magic Keyboard, and we’ve brought it to the MacBook Pro,” Apple’s Shruti Haldea said &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/exM1uajp--A?t=1957"&gt;as she explained the decision to ditch the Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt;, the touchscreen OLED strip Apple so enthusiastically introduced five years ago. “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/exM1uajp--A?t=1989"&gt;Having a wide range of ports can make life a lot easier for pros&lt;/a&gt;,” Haldea continued, concisely summarizing what professional users have been saying for roughly half a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZNF2i9fNRbLByiY1cLh5Kwg-9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939123/msedge_gtjccFwnty.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Mac product line manager Shruti Haldea introduces the new MacBook Pro — including a physical function row!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nxLP4M"&gt;MagSafe, the convenient magnetic charging connector, is also returning to laptops after Apple stopped including it in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97eR2f"&gt;Although it’s obviously backtracking, I think Apple is absolutely making the right call with all three of these changes. For the vast majority of users, a proper function row is far more useful than a software-based Touch Bar that failed to catch on with developers; a bevy of easily accessible ports make life easier for Pros and average Joes alike, and MagSafe is faster to connect than a USB-C cable and can prevent your laptop from being damaged when someone trips on the power cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DwJg1e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All three features feel like the right call&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pL4riF"&gt;But it’s hard to ignore the broader context of these improvements, which is that they effectively bring the company’s 2021 MacBook Pros back in line with the features they were already offering from 2012 to early 2016. Arguably, the primary reason these new MacBooks are being greeted with overwhelming enthusiasm now is that Apple made the wrong bet on where laptop design was headed back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RppqPt"&gt;The MacBook’s transition to USB-C arguably started with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8372335/12-inch-macbook-review"&gt;2015 12-inch MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, which included just two ports: one USB-C port to handle charging, display output, and connecting of any and all accessories and one 3.5mm headphone jack. But it was with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13436750/apple-macbook-pro-announced-laptop-price-release-date-specs"&gt;2016 refresh of the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s commitment to an exclusively USB-C laptop future became truly apparent. Rather than the collection of Thunderbolt, USB Type-A, HDMI, and SD card ports that previous models had included, the 2016 MacBook Pro lineup included a choice of either two or four USB Type-C / Thunderbolt ports, alongside a headphone jack. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/5/13523372/usb-c-macbook-adapter-donglelife-problems-thunderbolt"&gt;dongle era&lt;/a&gt; had begun.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro, and its sadly necessary USB-C adaptors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rD7InI"&gt;Apple was one of the earliest adopters of what was, at the time, a very new connector. And going all-in on USB-C was basically unheard of. USB Type-A was still dominant on laptops and desktops, while Android manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/2/12344688/samsung-galaxy-note-7-announced-price-release-date-specs"&gt;like Samsung&lt;/a&gt; were only just starting to switch away from Micro USB in their flagship phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OSJjQ"&gt;Most people know what happened next: owners were forced to invest in adapters for all their old peripherals. Their laptop itself may have gotten slightly slimmer and lighter, but for pro use on the go, any space or weight saved in a backpack or briefcase was tempered by the added bulk and complexity of the extra accessories you needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z1fiCu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An end to adapters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bHiVKJ"&gt;We all know what ended up happening, but I think an interesting question to ask is what Apple &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; was going to happen after it transitioned wholesale to USB-C. For what it’s worth, the company seemed, at the time, to have been genuinely caught off guard by the anger from users having to buy endless adaptors to connect basic accessories and, shortly after the release of its 2016 MacBook Pros, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13524272/apple-cutting-usb-c-adaptor-prices-macbook-pro"&gt;cut prices across swathes of its USB-C adapter lineup&lt;/a&gt; to help users “transition” to the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sgIaW"&gt;To me, this suggests Apple thought #DongleLife was going to be a temporary transitional phase rather than the new normal it eventually became. For an example of the kinds of accessories it thought would become commonplace in the future, take a look at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13440158/apple-event-lg-ultrafine-5k-displays"&gt;5K display from LG&lt;/a&gt; it announced onstage at the same event, which it said was designed to pair with the new MacBook Pro. The display used a single Thunderbolt 3 cable for video, power, and data and also acted as a USB hub, thanks to a trio of additional USB-C ports. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEP4cX8xXGWzaN321Mhlyhf2RTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938876/HKN62_AV5.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s 5K monitor, announced onstage alongside the MacBook Pro 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pshcOR"&gt;Had monitors like these quickly become commonplace, we would have ended up with a future where users could dispense with bulky dongles and adaptors and have the convenience of plugging into a static desk setup with just a single cable. But while some monitors did, what generally happened was that monitors continued to ship with a mix of HDMI and DisplayPort connectors, and users were forced to use adapters whenever they wanted to connect. Not to mention, plenty of people happily use the same monitor for far longer than the laptops they plug into them, particularly when they’re secondary displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAHSZx"&gt;Apple isn’t the only company to have made a bet on USB-C that didn’t quite pay off. In 2018, a consortium of companies that included AMD, Nvidia, Oculus, Valve, and Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/17/17583362/virtuallink-vr-headsets-oculus-valve-microsoft-connect-usb-c-cable"&gt;announced VirtualLink&lt;/a&gt;, a USB-C connection standard for VR headsets that could allow them to be powered and broadcast data over a single cable. But although the USB-C port appeared on Nvidia’s 20-series graphics cards, the standard was beset by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525827/valve-index-virtual-reality-usb-c-virtuallink-dongle"&gt;silly dongles and adaptors&lt;/a&gt; (sound familiar?) and had been dropped by the time the 30-series rolled around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAkeRP"&gt;It’s easy to see Apple ditching ports as a cynical cash grab in an attempt to drive sales of its own dongles and USB-C accessories. But a more generous reading is that Apple got its bet on the future wrong. It thought it could outsource a laptop’s ports to desk-based accessories like monitors and docks to make its laptops slimmer and more compact. But that ecosystem never seems to have taken off or become ubiquitous, and what happened instead was that people were forced to carry around endless adapters for simple tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wouG49"&gt;I have a couple of theories why Apple’s vision never became a reality. One is Macs just don’t have the market share to force a change like this across the whole industry, so manufacturers of monitors and peripherals were forced to stick with older standards from Windows machines for their most mainstream devices. Another is the confusing mess of standards supported by USB-C cables and accessories. Between Thunderbolt and USB’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/27/18243425/usb-3-2-standard-names-connectivity-cables-innovators-forum"&gt;smorgasbord of different versions&lt;/a&gt;, it can be difficult to know if a cable is even capable of making the most out of your device’s charging and data transferring capabilities, or — particularly early on — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10916264/usb-c-russian-roulette-power-cords"&gt;whether it’s going to fry its internals&lt;/a&gt;. It’s far from the easy plug-and-play future Apple seems to have had its sights on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EVCHz"&gt;Or, maybe people are more attached to their older PC accessories than Apple anticipated, particularly when it comes to expensive professional equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x0ViRR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s bet on wireless audio on the iPhone paid off in ways its USB-C laptop bet didn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUHPZy"&gt;It’s interesting, in retrospect, to compare Apple’s decision to switch wholesale to USB-C on the MacBook with its decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. This was another decision that generated an equal amount of jokes about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12852098/belkin-apple-iphone-7-plus-adapter-dongle-charge-music"&gt;adaptors and dongles&lt;/a&gt; at the time and raised similar suspicions that the move was a cash grab to help the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12839758/apple-is-biggest-winner-from-killing-headphone-jack"&gt;sell more Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt;. But, five years later, Apple’s decision appears to have been vindicated, with its competitors following suit. There’s now a thriving ecosystem of third-party wireless headphones, and I couldn’t tell you the last time I saw someone using one of Apple’s Lightning to 3.5mm adaptors (though, with wired headphones &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/wired-headphones-cool-airpods-b1936746.html"&gt;reportedly making a retro-styled comeback&lt;/a&gt;, that could change soon). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aar6yt"&gt;Whether that’s because Apple is more dominant when it comes to smartphones or just because the benefits of wireless audio were more obvious to people than USB-C accessories, people seem to have been far more ready to roll with Apple’s annoying headphone jack decision. There’s a valid debate to be had about whether Apple kicked off a trend towards wireless audio or whether its move just turbocharged one that was already taking place, but either way, Apple made a bet that the future of smartphone audio was wireless, and for all intents and purposes, it seems to have paid off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5LB8D"&gt;Although Apple stopped short of calling out its past MacBook designs, this week’s announcement was Apple’s biggest mea culpa &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission"&gt;since the Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; trash can. The event completed the company’s backtrack on basically every controversial decision it’s made with recent MacBooks, after already having made the decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;ditch its controversial butterfly keyboard&lt;/a&gt; in favor of more traditional scissor switches. Apple made the wrong call in 2016, but this week, it thankfully got itself back on track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIurBg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally listed the 2015 MacBook with the wrong screen size. It was 12 inches, not 13 inches. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
