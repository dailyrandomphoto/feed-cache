    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on an iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Stupd"&gt;More and more official papers are being turned into PDF documents, and you may be asked to sign one electronically while you’re away from your computer (here, by the way, is how to sign a PDF document using a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323097/pdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323097/pdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re using an iPhone, it’s actually not all that difficult; you can create a signature and reuse it by using the iPhone’s built-in Markup tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRNifU"&gt;Here’s what to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lMxrqY"&gt;Open the PDF document in Markup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VujaGy"&gt;Tap the plus sign at the bottom right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wiXtpr"&gt;Tap on the Signature button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0EwA9i"&gt;If you haven’t created any signatures yet, tap on the label at the top titled “New Signature.” (If you don’t see “New Signature,” tap the plus sign in the upper left corner.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Markup, tap on the plus and then the Signature button." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRS3AJXiLlTB2Xs-qRejNFZFz4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983485/IMG_AA00365EEDAD_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Markup, tap on the plus and then the Signature button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can label your saved signature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VYv-trmKLqK75dLdB4Ky3LZ8KTM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983494/IMG_68BC3F57889A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can label your saved signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5WufAk"&gt;You’ll be given the option of labeling your new signature with your full name, family name, nickname, etc. Or you can choose not to have a label at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nu2PJP"&gt;Once you’ve chosen your label, you can then sign your name at the bottom of the screen. There is a “Clear” button if you decide you need to try more than once to get it right. Tap “Done” at the top right corner when you’re ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MjSXxO"&gt;Your signature will then appear in a box on your document. You can move it and / or resize it until you’re happy with how it looks on the document. When you’re ready, tap anywhere outside the box. You can then use Markup for any other edits. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Draw your signature; tap “Clear” if its not to your liking." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t2afLYe2GLP3hrMm_21MgAQ7RKY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983496/IMG_1685F699DBDE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Draw your signature; tap “Clear” if its not to your liking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Move the completed signature to where you want it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yyYFi8hvsHWs1juWmzlhtkJ_ngc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983500/IMG_4E10B05B0701_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move the completed signature to where you want it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qkO4Dd"&gt;When you’re ready, tap “Done” in the upper left corner and save the file.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FYj2EX"&gt;The next time you open a PDF in Markup on your phone, tap on the Signature button, and the signature (or signatures) that you saved will be there. Just tap on it, and it will be dropped into your document. You can always select “Add or Remove Signature” if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>‘Sideloading is a cyber criminal’s best friend,’ according to Apple’s software chief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVyvU_-XAFY6dXHoDdqHGFmPB2Q=/64x0:706x428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087804/Screen_Shot_2021_11_03_at_9.59.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DdARwO"&gt;“Sideloading is a cyber criminal’s best friend and requiring that on iPhone would be a gold rush for the malware industry,” according to Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi, who delivered a dramatic speech at &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwstKnhWs6k"&gt;Web Summit 2021&lt;/a&gt; declaiming the security risks if Apple were required to let users sideload apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M23152"&gt;Federighi, who oversees Apple’s iOS and macOS software divisions, was specifically protesting the &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en"&gt;European Commission’s proposed Digital Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;, which, if passed, would require Apple to let users install apps outside of the iOS App Store. According to Federighi, the lack of sideloading is what separates Apple’s relatively low rate of malware on iOS from the “5 million Android attacks per month,” and that if Apple were forced to let users install their own apps, “the floodgates are open for malware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFEnxF"&gt;Federighi also argues against a popular proposed solution of letting users decide for themselves whether to take the risk of sideloading apps. The problem is that “criminals are clever, and they’re really good at hiding in plain sight,” and that even informed users might get caught by misleading websites, or even get stuck with fake app stores installed on their phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jUn5TT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is still very much against sideloading&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llCjh0"&gt;And even if &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, a tech-savvy smartphone expert, might not be fooled, Federighi plays on the heartstrings and asks the audience to think of the children or parents who might be fooled. “The fact that anyone can be harmed by malware isn’t something that we should stand for,” Federighi concludes, despite the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;Apple still routinely deals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;with multimillion-dollar scams&lt;/a&gt; that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;only just added the ability to report&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7BA5H"&gt;Federighi’s picture of doom doesn’t just stop there, though: he also raises the concern that if Apple were to allow sideloading, “some social networking apps will probably try to avoid the pesky privacy protections of the App Store and only make their apps available via sideloading.” According to Federighi, Apple’s privacy requirements in the App Store go beyond those of the letter of the law, and social media companies looking to escape those could force customers to choose between “losing touch with your friends online, or taking on the risks of sideloading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmjV5j"&gt;“Sideloading undermines security and puts people’s data at risk,” according to Federighi, and that if customers and regulators want the option to sideload apps, the alternative of Android should be enough to meet that without requiring it for iPhones. But all the concerns on iOS are curious, given the other half of his job description: leading the macOS software team, where apps can be freely installed outside of Apple’s app store (and have been for decades) without suffering from apocalyptic malware attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azTcgJ"&gt;If Apple wanted, it could enable iOS sideloading in a similar manner and require something like the Gatekeeper system on macOS, which allows for Apple to check signed developer IDs to confirm the software is genuine. It’s an argument that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667256/apple-vs-epic-trail-judge-craig-federighi-macos-security-arguments-iphone-ios-response"&gt;noted as well during the Apple / Epic trial&lt;/a&gt;, commenting that Federighi may be “stretching the truth” on Mac malware concerns and that Apple could likely make a similar system work on iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElfKnD"&gt;And most notably, Federighi’s speech completely ignores the fact that by requiring all apps to be installed through the App Store, it forces all app commerce to flow through the App Store, too — where Apple collects its highly contested 30 percent cut, to the tune of billions of dollars every year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s colorful HomePod Minis are a fun addition to your smart home decor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wy-pGeNtFTeKSbgtMx2DlUJupc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087598/jtuohy_211102_4860_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini now comes in three new color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eaq9PQ"&gt;Three colorful HomePod Minis were announced last month and went on sale this week, adding yellow, orange, and blue options to our smart speaker home decor selections. I got to try out the trio of bright speakers, and have to say I quite like adding a pop of color to my smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yq3o9S"&gt;Apple is a bit behind the ball here; both Google and Amazon have had color choices for their smart speakers for a while now. The Nest Minis come in coral and light blue colors, and Amazon’s Echo speakers have blue, tiger orange, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688035/billie-eilish-echo-studio-price-release-date-preorder"&gt;Billie Eilish-beige&lt;/a&gt; options. But as usual, Apple has gone the extra mile with its design here, creating something quite genuinely delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0A7k9z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844191"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PatSkt"&gt;Each $99 HomePod Mini comes with a matching colored box and a different shimmering, shimmying Mini logo, presumably mimicking the sounds your HomePod will deliver courtesy of that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734185/new-apple-music-voice-plan-price-features-app"&gt;Apple Music Voice subscription&lt;/a&gt; you’re planning to use it with (right?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDj2ub"&gt;The braided USB-C power cable (which still can’t be removed) is color-coordinated with the speaker and is a pastel version of the main event. The volume up and down buttons on the white control plate perfectly match the Mini’s color. Also — and this is very Apple — when you set up the Mini using your iPhone, the graphic that pops up matches the color of the Mini you’re pairing (actually useful when you are setting up three different colors at once).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9IiJJ3GuT9P9EWnmpUzMpvklfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982938/jtuohy_211102_4860_0030.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each pod comes with matching control buttons and a color-coordinated cord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UQlyvd"&gt;Speaking of those colors, they are a lot more impressive in person. When they were first announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22723141/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-price-release-date-features"&gt;Apple’s fall hardware event&lt;/a&gt;, my initial thought was they were a bit underwhelming. Orange and yellow aren’t top of mind when it comes to interior design color choices, although they are great for the odd “pop” of color. And the blue looked so dark as to not be that dissimilar to the existing dark grey option. Also, where were the green and red, Apple?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G0DJJsvzAD8e8HxGqd7Jz5S6H4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982935/jtuohy_211102_4860_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was able to color coordinate my Samsung Frame TV with the new HomePod Minis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XnnwlC"&gt;Once I got my hands on the speakers, though, and tried them out in a few different situations around the house, I found I had plenty of spots where they could fit right in. Although, admittedly, it was primarily in my children’s rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ7zkr"&gt;The yellow is very bright, definitely lemon on the color wheel, and the orange has a much more blood orange, reddish hue — closer to coral than the fruit Florida is famous for. However, next to a coral-colored Nest Mini, it pops a bit more and there is no hint of pink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15q4S8AN58suscRPYdvrOSbmvoE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982926/jtuohy_211102_4860_0008_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6l95h9MpukTcMRY9-UgFOqiIG74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982930/jtuohy_211102_4860_0010_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vvkDsR_QJ_Bd_NjyVoX4ORrWdxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982928/jtuohy_211102_4860_0009_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j09WB9IEkMSbLvpBZWkIAnxX2pQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982933/jtuohy_211102_4860_0014.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orange, yellow, blue, and the threesome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YlfJU2"&gt;The blue is my favorite (likely because I just redid my kitchen and chose dark blue cabinets, so it is the perfect fit there). It’s a deeply rich, almost royal blue and really pretty. The blue also doesn’t show as much shadow through the mesh, something that gives the brighter colors a bit of a muddy look when you get up close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ni8BjgsqbkTC-EyualirjXAqp7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982941/jtuohy_211102_4860_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The blue HomePod Mini is a perfect match in my kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gKIuIj"&gt;One advantage of these colors, and the dark grey option, over the white Mini, is they are less likely to start greying as they collect dust and dirt, something that’s been noticeable on the white version in my testing. Clearly, we need a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;special Apple cleaning cloth&lt;/a&gt; for our HomePods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utt0Bb"&gt;The new HomePod Minis are identical in function to the existing models. They work with Siri, can use your iPhone to make calls and send messages, act as a hub for your HomeKit home, and set alarms and timers. We will be testing them out shortly though, to explore some of the features added since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;our first review&lt;/a&gt;. They ship with software version 15.0, so you will need to upgrade to 15.1.1 out of the box to take advantage of new features such as spatial audio and lossless music with Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brydge 11 Max Plus keyboard with an 11-inch iPad Pro in it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PWj0BD"&gt;Following the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22553643/brydge-12-9-max-plus-review-price-shipping"&gt;12.9-inch Max Plus keyboard for the iPad&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Brydge is now releasing an 11-inch version. The new, smaller keyboard has all of the same features as its bigger sibling, including Brydge’s new magnetic mounting system and Instant-On Bluetooth tech, but is sized to fit all generations of the 11-inch iPad Pro and the fourth-generation of the 10.5-inch iPad Air. It’s available starting today, November 3rd, from both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-max-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D39674056966249&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759698%2Fbrydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brydge’s online store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NYS8O1M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $199.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR0P3l"&gt;Despite its smaller size, the 11-inch Max Plus’ pitch is exactly the same as the 12.9-inch model’s: it’s meant to provide a MacBook-like experience with an iPad. That includes a full keyboard layout with a function row, plus a large trackpad that supports multitouch gestures and navigation. The aluminum chassis can be purchased in either a dark gray or a silver finish to match your iPad’s color, and it has a very MacBook-like appearance when the iPad is installed in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AxoD1EnoshadMbeA7wjhr95UBKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980077/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back panel of the 11 Max Plus is plastic and has tabs to easily pop the iPad off of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sq5nntfMZ3aBYNgydxlj_THVy00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980078/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Max Plus connects to the iPad’s built-in magnets to hold it in place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7ayvW"&gt;The big new innovation with the Max Plus line is the magnetic attachment system, which eschews the clamps Brydge used in older designs for a full backplate that connects to the magnets inside the iPad to hold it in place. The advantage here is that it allows you to quickly remove the iPad from the keyboard and use it handheld and just as easily snap it back into place when you want to use the keyboard again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p84uXJ"&gt;The Max Plus does not use the iPad’s Smart Connector, relying instead on a Bluetooth connection with the tablet. To overcome the usual delays that happen when using a Bluetooth keyboard with an iPad, Brydge developed its Instant-On technology, which allows the keyboard to stay connected to the iPad for up to four hours, even if it isn’t being used, without detrimental battery drain on either the case or the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7G61ky"&gt;This makes waking up the iPad feel much the same as a directly connected keyboard and mitigates one of the major complaints with Bluetooth. Brydge claims up to three months of battery life between charges, but that varies greatly on how much you utilize the three-level backlight. In the week or so I’ve been testing the product, I’ve not had to charge it back up once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ax7BVZ"&gt;Brydge CEO Nick Smith tells me that the company’s inspiration for the keyboard feel was the vaunted 2015 MacBook Pro. As a result, the Max Plus keys have a bit more travel than either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard case&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547938/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-air-fourth-generation"&gt;Logitech’s Combo Touch&lt;/a&gt;, the two main competitors in this space. The keycaps themselves are also a little smaller and have a little bit more space between them, but I had no trouble getting comfortable with the layout after a few minutes of use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n88GEQqlJgIPgnFRtSS2HfnuTE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980079/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Max Plus has a full keyboard with function row and a large multitouch trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NzwXx3"&gt;Brydge is also very proud of the size of the trackpad it was able to include with the Max Plus; the 11-inch model has a larger trackpad than either Apple or Logitech’s keyboard. It supports multitouch gestures and has good tracking, if not quite as precise as Apple has in the Magic Keyboard. Due to the smaller size of the 11-inch’s deck, I did have a few instances of palm rejection, which caused my cursor to jump across the screen when I didn’t expect it to. But otherwise, the trackpad experience on the Max Plus is quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxdnmp"&gt;Using the Max Plus keyboard is a different experience than the Magic Keyboard or the Combo Touch, by design. It’s a chunkier, heftier product, adding nearly two pounds of weight to the iPad itself, but it’s more stable on a lap, like you’d expect a laptop to be. It’s also more comfortable to type on for longer periods because the deck provides more room to rest your hands. And the full function row is a boon compared to the Magic Keyboard, which requires reaching up to use the iPad’s buttons or touch the screen anytime you want to adjust brightness or volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPwJcz"&gt;Lastly, because the Max Plus uses a Bluetooth connection, you can remove the iPad from the case and still use the keyboard and trackpad with it. I particularly liked putting the iPad in a portrait orientation when working on a long document, which you can’t do with the Magic Keyboard or the Combo Touch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eZo1MBkMOokkxIqaaoS6YU9rVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980081/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When closed, the 11 Max Pro is chunkier than other keyboards, but preserves the MacBook-like aesthetic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qrsgNm"&gt;The Max Plus is also not designed to provide much in the way of protection. Unlike Logitech’s Combo Touch, when you remove it from the keyboard, you’re holding a bare iPad, and it doesn’t provide any corner protection from drops. If you are looking for a more protective design that has similar traits as the Max Plus, Brydge offers the plastic &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-air-max-plus%3Fvariant%3D39421148594281&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759698%2Fbrydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Air Max Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which provides four feet of drop protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoEeWd"&gt;At $200, the Max Plus undercuts Apple by about $100 and is priced similarly to the Combo Touch. It’s not a budget product by any means; that’s reflected in the copious amount of aluminum used and the long feature list. But if you’re looking for a way to get more out of your 11-inch iPad Pro or iPad Air and want a more traditional experience than Apple’s keyboard provides, there’s a lot to like here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Tis’ the season for AirPods discounts galore. Last week, Apple finally launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third generation of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a new AirPods lineup and dropping the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level AirPods from $159 to $129. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are also just around the corner, meaning many retailers are also starting to discount the AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and even the aforementioned third-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hV5pag"&gt;Even this far ahead of the shopping holiday, there are sizable discounts to be had on the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TaIhNe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Which AirPods model should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. Moreover, it only sells the model with a wired charging case, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. What’s great, though, is that this version frequently gets discounted, so you can buy it for even less. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $120 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0HdVMNz%253A%253AT00%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0HdVMNz%253A%253AT00%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747976896193620917" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;Although you can’t buy them from Apple, you can still also buy the entry-level AirPods with a wireless charging case elsewhere, which you can charge via a Qi wireless pad or a Lightning cable. Right now, you can get a pair for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0Hf3UNz%253A%253AT00%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0Hf3UNz%253A%253AT00%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; instead of their typical $199 list price. However, given the latest AirPods — which we’ll dive into just a minute — cost $30 extra and come with MagSafe support along with other perks, it may not be worth buying this model unless you’re truly strapped for cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;As previously mentioned, the newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems allow for a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model. Deals are currently hard to come by on the third-gen model given how recently they launched, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling them right now for $175. It’s a small discount, but also their lowest price yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="qBADDX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and comes with swappable silicone tips. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently received a firmware&lt;/a&gt; update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Additionally, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These start at $249, but you can buy them right now for $190 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you prefer, you can also purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;older version&lt;/a&gt; without MagSafe compatibility — which still supports Qi-compatible wireless chargers — for a discounted $175 at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max have been discounted to $449 at Amazon in the past month, there are currently no sales that deep to speak of. The Max are, however, currently available in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThsYtSLBr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $479, one of their better prices in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now, technically, build your own USB-C iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ldEp4WZoNnialYf5G-AJwwWJ08=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70081607/usbciphone.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUhqOu"&gt;Robotics engineering student Ken Pillonel wowed the internet last month with a wild hack that managed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722123/first-iphone-usb-c-port-robotics-engineering-student-custom"&gt;put a working USB-C port&lt;/a&gt; inside an iPhone X for a fully functional USB-C iPhone. And now, Pillonel has published a far more detailed video showing just how he managed to pull off the hack, &lt;a href="https://github.com/kenp-io/not-for-iphone-usb-c/tree/master/ip-x"&gt;along with a Github repository&lt;/a&gt; with technical details, CNC instructions, and information on the custom PCB that he designed for anyone brave enough to try and put together a similar hack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiIyLz"&gt;The 13-minute-long video shows off the nitty-gritty of Pillonel’s mod, which is simple in theory: combining a Lightning to USB-C connection together in a daisy chain to mimic a proper USB-C port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="brDvJQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVEQJNRmfDQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cumahx"&gt;The video shows off virtually the whole development process. It’s quite a journey, going from proof of concept prototypes, reverse engineering the Lightning connector (and eventually, reverse engineering a fake Lightning connector), ordering a custom flexible circle board, and machining the iPhone’s case to fit the physically larger USB-C connector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEhnb7"&gt;The video also shows off just how difficult it was to fit the extra circuitry, with the board bending around both sides of Apple’s Taptic Engine hardware to squeeze in all the necessary components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOKSKv"&gt;Pillonel is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F165161363347&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22759704%2Fusb-c-iphone-hack-mod-open-source-github-repo-ken-pillonel-design-video" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;auctioning off his original prototype&lt;/a&gt; on eBay, where bidding has already reached $3,400 as of the time of publishing this piece, for anyone with deep pockets that’s interested in a USB-C iPhone of their own. Pillonel does note that whoever does buy the phone shouldn’t restore, update, or erase it, open it, or “use it as your daily phone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQr8ch"&gt;Lastly, Pillonel has made the whole project open source so that others can build on his existing work, whether that’s making more custom USB-C iPhone X models or porting the design to other iPhones down the line (although the full PCB design won’t be posted until after the auction finished). He also notes that he plans to continue to build on the design, with goals for improving fast-charging, waterproofing, and even enabling USB-C accessories. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday approaching&lt;/a&gt;, the best iPad deals of the year are just around the corner, yet we’re already starting to see some solid discounts for those who can’t wait to grab one now. Whether you’re after the new 2021 entry-level iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or the latest iPad Mini, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnYL1M"&gt;We, of course, will keep an eye out for more deals as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday, however, so be sure to keep checking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mEJgRj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Friday deals: what time sales start at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21569881/black-friday-deals-start-time-hours-cyber-monday-stores"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model. The ones you can currently find in stock, such as at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJrISyuZP4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, are full price. Without any significant discounts, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has 64GB of storage instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with 256GB of storage for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant is $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;We’ve previously seen Walmart discounting both Wi-Fi models of the new iPad by $30. Although at the moment they’re sold out, there’s a possibility we could see a similar discount again as we approach Black Friday. However, if you can’t wait until then, Best Buy is selling the Wi-Fi versions of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWvH7LMj0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB&lt;/a&gt; full-priced while taking $30 off of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt;. Both models come with free six-month subscriptions to Apple Music and Apple News Plus. Note these freebies are only available to new subscribers, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 has the same 7.9-inch display and design as its previous iterations but with refreshed internal specs for its time. Just like the base iPad, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new iPad Mini was announced&lt;/a&gt; during Apple’s recent “California Streaming” event that starts at a higher price point of $499. Meanwhile, the base 64GB outgoing iPad Mini with its older A12 Bionic processor now is on sale starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWn7uOMT5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$360 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; instead of its typical $400. We have previously seen the 64GB recently drop to $299, so it’s possible this price could only decrease on Black Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntoIEO"&gt;You can also buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWpBeCEve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB variant for $495&lt;/a&gt; instead of $550, which is around $150 cheaper if you compare the old and new models on equal footing when it comes to storage. This could be a great opportunity for anyone who needs more storage or prefers the classic home button, Touch ID, or a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fifth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen, top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has sadly forfeited its headphone jack in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is. Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; will also throw in six months free of Apple Music when you purchase the iPad Mini full-priced from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, however, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward for the most part, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $539 — $60 off the list price — in space grey and sky blue at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB, Wi-Fi-enabled version is also available for a $100 discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with your choice of many colors marked down to $650 at checkout.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in some configurations at Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB base storage is discounted to $750 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB model is available for $900 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-silver%2F-%2FA-77616876%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D1148110%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestIPadDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; in both color configurations. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $950 and $1,005, respectively. Best Buy will also throw in six-month Apple News Plus and Apple Music subscriptions for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Some similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo. The 256GB model is $949 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $1,000 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748082168808445595" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the 512GB model is $1,100 instead of $1,300 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; while the massive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; is $1,300 instead of $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi is selling at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in silver for $700 – a record low – instead of $799, and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F354993710" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has it for $749. Walmart is also discounting the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-512GB-Space-Gray%2F221905739%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; option with Wi-Fi in space gray to $950, a healthy $150 off the list price of the larger storage model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhnrgA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10840379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;The Mini LED-equipped 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in both colors for $999, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date.

    <title>Fired #AppleToo organizer files labor charge against the company</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O0HhUg"&gt;Janneke Parrish, a leader of the #AppleToo movement, has filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company, alleging the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement"&gt;fired her in retaliation for organizing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubzf2D"&gt;Parrish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;created the #AppleToo platform&lt;/a&gt; to help colleagues air their concerns with Apple’s culture of “pervasive sexism” and pay equity, according to the complaint. Then, in October, she was fired, allegedly for failing to comply with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;workplace investigation into leaks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9emqc"&gt;Parrish says the company terminated her based on “false and pretextual reasons” — namely because she “spoke up regarding her personal experiences regarding workplace concerns and helped give voice to her co-workers’ concerns in a workplace where such issues have been systematically siloed, suppressed, and unaddressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhM1VW"&gt;“It seems like all the tech companies are using the same playbook,” says labor attorney Laurie Burgess. “They get rid of outspoken organizers by asserting they are responsible for a leak without any proof or documentation that that person was indeed responsible. My client denies having leaked this information.” Burgess is also representing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22751847/netflix-employees-dave-chappelle-file-charges-nlrb"&gt;fired and suspended Netflix organizers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as prominent Google organizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoiwGm"&gt;This is the seventh unfair labor practice charge that has been filed against Apple since August. Last month, former senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-ceo-s-anti-leak-edict-broke-the-law-ex-employee-alleges?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;accused Tim Cook of violating the National Labor Relations Act&lt;/a&gt; when he warned employees that “people who leak confidential information do not belong here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4auhi"&gt;Cher Scarlett, an Apple software engineer, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;filed a complaint in September&lt;/a&gt; alleging the company stopped employees from engaging in protected activity when they tried to discuss their pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfGsTl"&gt;An employee on the AppleCare team, Apple’s version of customer service, filed a charge on September 28th alleging they were unlawfully fired. This charge has not been previously reported. The employee’s identity is not known at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xa0mbe"&gt;The NLRB is currently investigating claims against the tech giant. If it finds they have merit, it can try to secure a settlement. The labor board can also issue its own complaint if settlement talks fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLmubA"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on a Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="adobe signature" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjbjjFADHTq31dc0jvrpDmyryDw=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941923/Adobe-Reader-EchoSign-iPad-Ink_Signature_Tool.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="biDYjK"&gt;These days, hard copy paperwork is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule, and more and more official papers are being turned into PDF documents. (PDF stands for Portable Document Format; it is a standard created by Adobe in the early 1990s that allows paper documents to be turned into exact digital copies.) However, even digital documents have to be signed. You can do it the long way — print those documents out, sign them, and then scan them back into your computer — or you can create a digital signature and place it directly on the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldxgQF"&gt;If you’re using a Mac, the process is refreshingly easy — just use the built-in Preview app to create and save your digital signature. (If you’re using a Windows PC, unfortunately, it’s not quite as simple.) After that, when you open a PDF using Preview, it will be a simple matter of dropping the signature into the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wuj5t1"&gt;To create your signature, you first have to have a PDF ready:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FqdcaZ"&gt;Open a PDF document using your Mac’s built-in Preview app. (If you don’t have a PDF document handy, you can create one with your favorite word processor and save it as a PDF file.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTP7Vf"&gt;Open the Markup tool, either by clicking on the “pen in a circle” symbol on the top right of the Preview window or by selecting View &amp;gt; Show Markup Toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9tESYh"&gt;Click on the Signature icon (it’s the one that looks like a signature on a line).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the Signature icon to create your signature via trackpad, camera, or phone" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UUzOkY0V_xOxGmA2jcph5CZPuPQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357983/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_3.00.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the Signature icon to create your signature via trackpad, camera, or phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gOqMsK"&gt;Now, you can create your signature. (If you’ve already created at least one signature, click on the “Create Signature” button.) You will have either two or three buttons on top of the window. Here are your choices: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YZoTUM"&gt;Select Trackpad. Click on the “Click Here to Begin” button in the center of the screen, sign your name on the trackpad, hit any key, and then click on “Done.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tF4TPe"&gt;Write your name on a piece of white paper, select Camera, and hold the paper up to the camera (and on the line that appears across the screen) until you see the signature appear on the screen. (Two notes: first, the signature will appear reversed as you hold it up, but the digitized version will be correct. Also, if there are any other markings on the paper or if the paper doesn’t fill the screen, you are likely to get other markings recorded besides the signature, so you may need to try it a couple of times to get it right.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="As you hold your written signature up to the camera, it will appear reversed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bw8S_766-dKovKfLDHMnZFnJVsg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357988/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.26.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you hold your written signature up to the camera, it will appear reversed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror-image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DH8G9WgqNgZSplZCnVpDfYeaBYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357992/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.29.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="HedzDU"&gt; If you have an iPhone associated with the Mac, you will also have a button labeled “iPhone.” Choose that, and your phone will almost immediately pop up a field on which you can write your signature; your signature will be mirrored on your Mac.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror-image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O7c_r1m6Yo-O7GwkqYvJqIRUBFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358000/mysig.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This screenshot shows what the signature field looks like on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="As you write, the signature will simultaneously appear on your screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9X2ZS9zUPN0qTZ-lpYuolp4Kh0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358019/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.34.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you write, the signature will simultaneously appear on your screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AgSFFf"&gt;With any of these methods, if you need to try again, just hit the “Clear” button on the lower left of the window to get rid of the unwanted signature. Once you’re happy with it, click on “Done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWPnNK"&gt;Now, whenever you want to add your signature to a document in Preview, just click on the Signature icon and click on your signature. It will appear in a box on your document, which you can then use to adjust the size and location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your signature will now appear under the Signature icon in the Preview app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1t60BhdsgBtpswS5moYEm85nzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358020/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.42.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your signature will now appear under the Signature icon in the Preview app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMQ-3CcSxEIGPJYSAPS4PQPuK7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358021/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.46.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can move the signature to where you want it and make it larger or smaller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="53mHeR"&gt;And if you want a second or third signature, just create them in the same way. After that, when you click the Signature icon, you’ll see all your created signatures and can select the one you want to use. Don’t need one of the signatures anymore? Hover over the signature until you see a small “x” next to it, and click on that to delete it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Opening day at the Amazon 4-Star brick and mortar store located in Soho in New York City." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VyUG7BE3sU0uVmia7hA3FBoPa-M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67804971/akrales_180927_2984_0073_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="woOIOK"&gt;Nothing is more frustrating than buying a new computer, phone, game console, or backpack and finding out that you could have gotten it for a lot cheaper somewhere else. In order to keep customers happy — and prevent them from going elsewhere — many retailers offer price-matching policies where they promise to match a lower price that you’ve found elsewhere. They will also sometimes match themselves if you buy something that goes down in price a week later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ax9brN"&gt;What follows are the price-matching policies for a variety of major retailers. There are a few things to make note of here. First, all price-matching policies have a number of rules attached to them. We’ve summarized some of the rules here, but you’d be advised to go to the links that we’ve provided and read the policy carefully. Second, and logically enough, retailers that are marketplaces for other sellers, such as Amazon or Costco, don’t have price-matching policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XPiVHS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SnrYOy"&gt;Finally, most retailers that do have price-matching policies suspend them for special occasions, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. So if your favorite store isn’t offering a Black Friday deal on that phone you want, you can’t wave an ad showing a 50 percent off deal from another retailer and expect it to be honored. But at other times of the year, these price matches can save you a nice amount of cash. So keep them in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL1GkN"&gt;Another thing to keep in mind: there are exceptions to most rules. So if you’re looking for a deal on a product and you know of a lower price elsewhere (or one that was offered previously at the same retailer), it never hurts to call and ask if they’ll match the price. Meanwhile, we will continue to update this page if and when we get more information about retailers’ policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Box Padded" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVVDqo-ZRtvgpbifq_CxcaoG5v8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/808921/amazon-box_padded.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zlWjKJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201895700"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Da17oI"&gt;Amazon.com doesn’t offer price matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0xnH6m"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/sales-policies/retail_us.html"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5zjbYJ"&gt;While we’ve &lt;a href="https://thekrazycouponlady.com/tips/money/save-apple-products"&gt;seen some claims&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will price-match up to 10 percent for products bought at certain major retailers, there is no official policy on the company’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rPGuh"&gt;Apple does say that if it reduces its price on an Apple-branded product within 14 days from when you received your item, you can visit an Apple Store or contact the Apple Contact Center at 1-800-676-2775 to request a refund or get credit for the price difference.  However, that doesn’t apply to special sales like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Qi8pdG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/6744eb1c-2f60-4f58-b788-fe62bdda77c5"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="UbTuol"&gt;B&amp;amp;H says that it might be able to honor a current lower price or match the price of a competitor, but it does so on a case-by-case basis. You have to contact its Customer Service team using the on-site &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2Fshcalendar.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2FcontactForm.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, or by calling (800) 221-5743 / (212) 239-7765.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dNk2pN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fcustomer-service%2Fprice-match-guarantee%2Fpcmcat290300050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat290300050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lR0K8U"&gt;Best Buy’s Price Match Guarantee states that a product could be eligible for a price reduction if it’s new, identical to the competitor’s product, immediately available at a qualifying competitor’s store or on its site, and not shown on &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Fbest-buy-price-match-guarantee%2Fpcmcat297300050000.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat297300050000&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s exclusion list&lt;/a&gt; (which includes “items for sale the Friday before Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLKa50"&gt;However, Best Buy &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Fbest-buy-holiday-faqs%2Fpcmcat748300621076.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat748300621076&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will refund&lt;/a&gt; Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members the difference on any “Black Friday Price Guarantee” item whose prices go lower on or before November 26th. Members will receive their refunds by December 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="online-tab"&gt;You have to either communicate with Best Buy via its on-site chat, making sure you’re able to show the ad or website with a lower price, to get the difference. Alternatively, you can call 1-888-237-8289 or visit any Best Buy or Pacific Sales store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zA0C0T"&gt;Best Buy will also, upon request, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Fbest-buy-price-match-guarantee%2Fpcmcat297300050000.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat297300050000&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;match its previous in-store or online price&lt;/a&gt; as long as it’s done during the return and exchange period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3qB94X"&gt;&lt;a href="https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1162/~/does-costco-price-match-with-other-retailers%3F"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4PeVC3"&gt;Costco does not price-match with competitors. However, according to the website, it will &lt;a href="https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/628/related/1"&gt;issue a credit for the difference between the price you paid and a promotional price&lt;/a&gt; if you bought the item online at Costco.com and requested the credit up to 30 days before the change in price. If you bought the product from a Costco warehouse location, visit the membership counter at the store where you made the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jIkK4a"&gt;Before you make a purchase, Dell will price-match a new computer that shares the same key features and specs as the one you bought (such as memory, hard drive capacity, processor, etc.) from Dell, HP, Apple, or Lenovo. You can call 1-844-906-4250 or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/lp/chat-live-with-product-expert" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;chat online&lt;/a&gt; and show a Dell sales expert a link to the competitor’s product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4kwKE"&gt;You can also contact the company about a price difference within 30 days of purchase. However, there is a long list of restrictions, and none of this is available between Thanksgiving Day and the Monday following Thanksgiving or on Green Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="QRyQwX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fright-to-cancellation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3KrRyo"&gt;We could not find any evidence of a price-matching policy at DJI. However, if DJI reduces the price on a product within seven days from when you received it, you can contact the company within that time at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fcontact&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.dji.com/contact&lt;/a&gt; to request a refund or credits for the difference between the price you have been charged and the current selling price. This doesn’t include special sales events, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1z7myz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fbest-price-guarantee%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RSqKIj"&gt;If you find a lower price from a qualifying competitor on an eBay Deal item that you bought within 48 hours — or on another product with the “Best Price Guarantee” symbol attached to it — you’ll get “110 percent” of the difference. That means eBay will give you an eBay coupon for the difference in price between what you bought the item for and what the competitor is selling it for, plus an additional 10 percent of that price difference. Note, however, these coupons will expire within 30 days of being issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmKMzB"&gt;The products must be new and unopened and identical to the competitor’s item. You have to contact &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fhelp%2Fbuying%2Fpaying-items%2Febay-deals-price-match-guarantee%3Fid%3D4627%26st%3D2%26pos%3D3%26query%3DeBay%2520Deals%2520Price%2520Match%2520Guarantee%26intent%3Dbest%2520pri%23contactWay&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay Customer Service&lt;/a&gt;, and if they verify your claims are legitimate, you will receive the coupon and be able to use it toward your next eBay purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kKze31"&gt;&lt;a href="https://care.gamestop.com/"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YUBNOV"&gt;Wario64, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-new-gaming-console-545e87c5-0a6f-4384-8b69-dbded2737e01.html#:~:text=Wario64,worse"&gt;best video game deal-finders&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1387484248412540928"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in April 2021 the store &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/gamestop-price-matching-first-improvement-new-leadership/#:~:text=According%20to%20Wario64%2C%20GameStop%20has,like%20flash%20deals%20and%20bundles."&gt;has issued&lt;/a&gt; a price-matching policy. At this time, however, we could not find any evidence of one at GameStop. We will contact their representatives and update this post when we get a definitive answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QSyTYW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleshopping/answer/9248265?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9112467"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXpzci"&gt;According to the Google site, the company doesn’t price match at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="luaqEM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpcv%2Fpricematch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5bEOgs"&gt;According to HP.com, the company will match the current pre-tax price for new comparable PCs and identical HP printer, display, and accessory model numbers from nationally recognized online retailers, such as Dell, Amazon, or Best Buy. The specs have to be the same; however, the product model number does not need to be identical for computers. You have to ask for the match at the time of purchase by calling&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;1-800-888-0229. You can’t request a price match via email or chat, either, and the policy does not extend to items bought during promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RzcqT"&gt;If you find a comparable product at a lower price during the return period, you can email HP at &lt;a href="mailto:myhpsales@hp.com"&gt;myhpsales@hp.com&lt;/a&gt;. This only applies to branded HP products and doesn’t apply to products purchased during certain sales events, like the week of Thanksgiving through the week following Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zlGHar"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fshopping-faq%2F%3ForgRef%3Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252F%23payments&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EZgY6s"&gt;Lenovo will match the price of comparable Lenovo, HP, or Dell PCs with the same key specs a nationally recognized online retailer sells at the time of purchase. You can call 1-855-253-6686 and select option 2&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to get the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puO6jm"&gt;Lenovo will also refund you the difference if the price of a product you buy from the company lowers during the holiday season. Through January 17th, 2021, customers can request an adjustment on orders made on its site between October 18th, 2021 and December 17th, 2021 (for up to five of the same products). You can still request a price adjustment outside of that time frame within 30 calendar days from the date of invoice. Note this does not apply to special discount offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zU8pt"&gt;To get the holiday season price difference credit, you’ll need to fill out a form on the site and take a screenshot of the lower price on Lenovo.com with a date/time stamp included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="S3XMgj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fb%2Fwhy-microsoft-store%3Ficid%3Dfooter_why-msft-store_7102020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Umm33M"&gt;Until January 2nd, 2022, if you discover a lower price on a product purchased at the Microsoft Store, the company will refund you the difference (with certain exclusions — for example, it does not apply to bulk buys of more than two devices). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vD4bIp"&gt;At other times, Microsoft will refund you the difference if it lowers the price of a product within 30 days of purchase. For Surface devices, you have up to 60 days but with some exclusions — the price match doesn’t extend to the Surface Hub, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4qiB7"&gt;You can call 1-877-696-7786 to get the refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6E4o7E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpromotions.newegg.com%2Fnepro%2F16-2624%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ndafcr"&gt;Newegg offers price-matching on select items; these products are identified by the label “Price Match Guarantee” that appears in the price box on the right of the product page. This applies whether you find that lower price on Newegg or at what Newegg judges to be a major retailer. You need to notify Newegg of the lower price within 14 days of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mi0pN6"&gt;The price-match guarantee is not valid during major holiday sales events, including Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Green Monday. However, Newegg does offer what it calls &lt;a href="https://kb.newegg.com/knowledge-base/black-friday-price-protection/"&gt;“Black Friday Price Protection”&lt;/a&gt; — if you purchase any product that has that badge, is purchased between October 14th, 2021 and November 21st, 2021, and is discounted on or before November 30th, 2021, you can be refunded the difference. According to Newegg, you don’t have to do anything; the refund will be processed by December 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oTri2i"&gt;If you buy a product online, you can request a price match within eight days of purchase for Sam’s Club items with promotional prices. Neither deal applies to events such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PTIGUW"&gt;We didn’t find anything on the Sonos site about price-matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gUKzHp"&gt;&lt;a href="http://help.target.com/help/SubCategoryArticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Availability+%26+Pricing"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0LHIy"&gt;Target will match the price of an item that you find for less either at Target or at a &lt;a href="https://target.scene7.com/is/content/Target/GUEST_625b83e8-f353-41bf-8a1c-abc6876f482f"&gt;select list of competitors&lt;/a&gt; if you ask for it at the time of or within 14 days of your purchase. You can either bring your proof into the store or call for online purchases at 1-800-591-3869. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j58EZZ"&gt;If you buy a product in-store or online starting October 10th, 2021, Target will also adjust the price if it lowers it on or before December 24th, 2021. Additionally, Target will price match designated discounted items that are a part of its “Holiday Best” sale if their price goes down through December 24th, 2021. Clearance sales and other storewide or category promotions are excluded. There is a complete list of exceptions on the website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dJElQg"&gt;Walmart’s online store offers price matching on one in-stock item per customer per day from a specified list of retailers. There is a long list of restrictions on the site; for example, it &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/policies#price-match-policy"&gt;does not apply to in-store purchases&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not apply to prices shown during pre-Black Friday events, as well as Black Friday and Cyber Week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxttTR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 2nd, 2021, 4:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Information about Microsoft’s holiday price-matching policy has been added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
