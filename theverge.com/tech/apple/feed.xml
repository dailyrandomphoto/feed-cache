    <title>Apple announces 16-inch MacBook Pro with new ports and design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3n76A8lOcCeTxI7UKOuQ0M1CsQ=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012026/lcimg_982af7b3_d14a_4a82_8073_a94b6e73fdd5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2xXc9"&gt;Apple has introduced its new 16-inch MacBook Pro, promising an upgrade in both design and performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyW7Ra"&gt;The chassis has also received a modern redesign. The device is 4.7 pounds and 16.8 mm thick, with a 16.2-inch display. The Touch Bar has been replaced by physical keys, and there’s an HDMI port on the right side in addition to a Thunderbolt 4 port and an SD slot, in addition to a headphone jack and two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left. It’s the most connectivity we’ve ever seen from a Mac notebook, according to Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhRU2Y"&gt;The first MacBook Pro 16 debuted in November 2019. It had a very similar design to previous 15-inch MacBook Pros and was powered by Intel’s 9th-Gen processors (which are now two generations old). Reviewers praised its outstanding keyboard and audio, in addition to its power, but moaned about the limited connectivity — there were only two Thunderbolt ports on each side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sS0Fuw"&gt;Apple announced two new processors alongside the 16-inch MacBook Pro: the M1 Pro and the M1 Max, which both have 10 cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlngy4"&gt;The M1 chip that Apple announced last November (which now powers the MacBook Air, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Mac Mini, the iPad Pro, and the 2021 iMac) has blown competing offerings out of the water when it comes to processing power, efficiency, and integrated graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHtxSE"&gt;But customers have been waiting for Apple to release processor workstation machines, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro and a potential successor to the 27-inch iMac. It’s safe to say that many people are eagerly awaiting this MacBook Pro — not just to purchase for themselves but to see whether the M1 Max will take the laptop market by storm in the same way its predecessor did. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new MacBook Pro has a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vs_a3EC0lVvh66-mJaX1RihgKao=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012024/lcimg_dbbf28e3_568c_48d1_8c66_10c4149e89fe.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="koVG91"&gt;Apple is adding a notch on the display of its new MacBook Pro. It’s a cut out that will house the camera system, much like how Apple moved to a notch design for its iPhone X launch in 2017. The surprising addition of the notch comes in the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, equipped with Apple’s new M1 Pro silicon inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPNtvK"&gt;The 14-inch MacBook Pro is completely redesigned, and the bezels have been completely trimmed down thanks to this notch. The bezels at the side at 3.5mm, that’s 24 percent thinner than before, and up top it’s 60 percent thinner. The macOS menu bar now wraps around the camera, and it seems to look a lot better with dark mode enabled so the notch isn’t as noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8nZA4"&gt;This display is also 120Hz with HDR support, so you do get a big jump in fluidity for the notch. Apple is also adding an SD card slot, HDMI port, and more hardware improvements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJkOe8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Pro event live blog &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new 14-inch MacBook Pro with a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8Gu1yCl8X5f8qVymayXFLwwadY=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012007/1Rm4aV2YiD.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzYFl7"&gt;Apple has announced a redesigned MacBook Pro, which now includes a 14-inch screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;Apple’s new M1 Pro and Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, a notch, and a wider selection of ports in addition to the standard Thunderbolt ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMzX0"&gt;The redesign is the first major one in Apple’s pro laptop lineup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;since 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the year that brought ill-fated butterfly keyboards, the Touch Bar, and Thunderbolt 3 as the standard and only port type (with the exception of a headphone jack, of course). It also marks the return of the mid-size 14-inch screen, which Apple hasn’t put on a laptop since the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook#iBook_G4_(%22Snow%22)"&gt;2005 iBook G4&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beNUXV"&gt;It’s nice to see Apple more clearly differentiating the smaller MacBook Pros. The lineup has been a bit confusing for the past few years — the two-port MacBook Pro and four-port 13-inch computers were awkwardly lumped together but were pretty different computers with different processors and prices. Now, the screen size difference makes the distinction clear: people looking for portability can get the Air or 13-inch Pro, and the 14-inch Pro exists for those looking for more horsepower.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod Mini gets three new color options</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini ... now in color&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0FT5Ir"&gt;With Siri now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22720890/siri-voice-control-ecobee-smart-thermostats"&gt;socializing on other smart speakers&lt;/a&gt;, Apple took to the stage at its October event to announce a new look for its HomePod Mini smart speaker. In addition to white and black (space gray), you will soon be able to pick up a HomePod Mini in yellow, orange, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dctHY3"&gt;Apple is catching up with the competition here. Google’s Nest Mini smart speakers have blue and orange options, and there’s also a blue Amazon’s Echo Dot, plus some fun animal-themed colors offered on the Echo Dot Kids edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ql281U"&gt;Apple’s new, colorful smart speakers cost the same, $99, and will be available in November.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors take its in-house Arm-based chips to new heights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7BlgsBIEdxifeQl6sj7oGLgHlM=/127x0:1288x774/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011926/Untitled.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lzy4HC"&gt;Apple has officially announced its most powerful chips ever: the M1 Pro and M1 Max, souped-up versions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558095/apple-silicon-m1-chip-arm-macs-soc-charge-power-efficiency-mobile-processor"&gt;the M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; that it debuted last fall and the heart of its new MacBook Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MyN0q"&gt;The original M1 chip was announced a little less than a year ago as Apple’s first in-house, Arm-based chip for laptops. At launch, it was featured in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s revamped MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;the entry-level Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;2021 iMac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad Pro refreshes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MulTxQ"&gt;But as good as the M1 chip was, it was only a solution for replacing Intel on Apple’s entry-to-mid level hardware, with its high-end MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini models (meant for developers, programmers, graphic designers, and other more demanding workloads) all notably still sticking with Intel’s chips for the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2gnb7E3RgMZiuUET43W0Lk7P2Zw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936632/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_1.16.30_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLnsCOhvR8rB2XTIDFmtkhLpl-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936602/lcimg_2d0f1c7f_4824_4e90_b501_7d917bcd4ae2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o8R39h"&gt;The M1 Pro and M1 Max are Apple’s long-awaited answer to that issue: while both are built on the same 5nm process, Apple is promising big jumps in performance here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REgwYE"&gt;For the M1 Pro, Apple promises 70 percent better CPU performance and twice the graphics performance compared to the M1. While the basic architecture is still the same on the M1 Pro, Apple is upping the hardware here in a big way, with a 10-core CPU that offers eight performance cores and two efficiency cores, along with a 16-core GPU with 2,048 execution units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFZK7y"&gt;The new chip also supports more RAM, with configuration options up to 32GB (although, like the M1, memory is still integrated directly into the chip itself, instead of user-upgradable) with 200GB/s memory bandwidth. In total, the M1 Pro has 33.7 billion transistors, roughly twice that number of transistors that the M1 has. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fiLZU7uzSdtjK0cNs59lV7tp9Dk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936603/lcimg_c4568d1b_5f1a_468a_9292_9743a7eadbd3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dl3qmc"&gt;But Apple isn’t stopping there: it also announced the even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;powerful M1 Max, which has the same 10-core CPU configuration, with eight performance cores and two efficiency cores. But the M1 Max doubles the memory bandwidth (to 400GB/s), RAM (up to 64GB of memory) and GPU (with 32 cores, 4,096 execution units and four times the GPU performance of the original M1.) The M1 Max features 57 billion transistors, making it the largest chip that Apple has made yet. The new chip also means that you can connect up to four external displays to a single device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7ZgZN"&gt;Apple also promised that the new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips offer up to 1.7 times better CPU performance per watt compared to both the regular M1 and unspecified four-core and eight-core PC laptop chips — although the company didn’t give hard numbers, or identify what other chips it was comparing things to, making it difficult to ascertain just how the new chips will hold up in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6VF9S7nURce1VWHrkb-6vohvu4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936647/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_1.21.36_PM.png"&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s new voice-only plan costs $4.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UtaG2Kgj_x2SxUy84d3Epf9FIWA=/146x0:1636x993/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011911/25cFLr6.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Music Voice Plan lets you access music through Siri.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g3viTf"&gt;Apple unveiled a new Voice plan for Apple Music during its Unleashed event on Monday that will be $4.99 per month. You can use only your voice and its Siri voice assistant to access all Apple Music content across Apple devices. It will be available later this fall in 17 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="du7pLy"&gt;“Apple Music and Siri are natural partners and already work seamlessly together,” Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-introduces-the-apple-music-voice-plan/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. And non-subscribers can sign up for a free, seven-day trial without auto-renewal to check out Voice before they commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKcI0d"&gt;Users can subscribe to the plan with Siri by saying, “Hey Siri, start my Apple Music Voice trial,” or by signing up through the Apple Music app. Once subscribed, users can request music to be played across all of their Siri-enabled devices, including HomePod mini, AirPods, iPhone, and when using CarPlay. Voice plan subscribers will have access to hundreds of new stations and playlists and full playback controls, including unlimited song skipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eE9bgi"&gt;The plan seems in response to Amazon Music’s Echo plan that’s priced at $3.99/month, which lets you use its Alexa voice assistant to request music via an Echo or Fire TV device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxGn7V"&gt;Voice plan subscribers will get customized in-app experiences with suggestions based on their preferences and recently played music. There will be a dedicated section called “Just Ask Siri” with tips for how to optimize Siri for Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces third-generation AirPods for $179</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NyOewOw7VnmjT0zzEC6Im56oKuQ=/238x0:2659x1614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011892/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_1.11.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M1fVSZ"&gt;Apple has just introduced its third-generation AirPods, the latest set of the company’s massively popular true wireless earbuds. With a new design that blends aspects of the prior AirPods and AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods retain a hard plastic, one-size-fits-most fit in the ear. But the form factor is seeing significant change for the first time since 2016: the new earbuds have much shorter stems than before. Priced at $179, the third-generation AirPods will be available to preorder today and will go on sale next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4qpkZ"&gt;They’re now water and sweat resistant. Battery life has been extended to 6 hours of continuous listening. With the case, you’ll get a total of 30 hours. The new third-gen AirPods have a redesigned custom driver and adaptive EQ that automatically tunes and optimizes audio output. Apple has carried over the “force sensor” controls of the AirPods Pro, and it also says the new AirPods are compatible with its MagSafe charging system.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation AirPods have shorter stems than their predecessors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mLFgKo"&gt;The company is putting a big emphasis on spatial audio and Dolby Atmos music mixes with the new AirPods. They’ll support the same head tracking capabilities as the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, which also apply when watching video. Already seen by many as the champion of voice call quality, Apple claims to have further improved microphone performance on the latest AirPods. They “feature AAC-ELD, a superior speech codec that offers full HD voice quality, providing clear, natural communication for FaceTime calls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ6Tic"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;original AirPods&lt;/a&gt; were released in 2016 and were followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;a second-gen pair&lt;/a&gt; that added wireless charging and other modest improvements. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; arrived in 2019 with a more traditional in-ear fit with silicone ear tips. Last year, Apple expanded the AirPods line to cover over-ear headphones for the first time with the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;the $549 AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s list of features for the third-generation AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tbkDkL"&gt;There’s a lot riding on the latest AirPods to sustain the huge popularity of their predecessors. Above all else, the earbuds are well regarded for their ease of use and seamless integration with Apple’s ecosystem of hardware, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3CNfp"&gt;But Apple faces more competition than ever before — especially at lower price points. Aside from the latest alternatives from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, Jabra, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Sony, and others, newer entrants like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing&lt;/a&gt; have sought to set themselves apart on design and value with starting prices around $99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYJgAq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Pro event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pro event live blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple’s event invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15YLNFd7PH2RbmgL3kbAafD-J4s=/61x0:2047x1324/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011638/Screen_Shot_2021_10_14_at_9.13.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s event invitation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple says something is getting “unleashed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="95O0lC"&gt;Apple is kicking off the very best week in tech with a rare Monday event, one it’s decided to call “Unleashed.” That could refer to any number of things, but at a high level we are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/17/22725365/apple-october-macbook-event-unleashed-rumors-pro-airpods"&gt;expecting it to be about new, redesigned MacBook Pro laptops with Apple’s own processors&lt;/a&gt;. Will they be called M1X, M2, or something else? What will the GPU performance be like? Will battery life match the excellent quality of the original generation of M1 Macs? All open questions we hope to see answered today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqn21b"&gt;There should be two sizes, with 14- and 16-inch screens. There have been long-standing rumors that Apple will bring back an SD card reader slot, MagSafe for charging, and may even switch these Macs over to more advanced, Mini-LED displays. Apple is also said to be doing away with the unloved (except by a few) Touch Bar and will have a regular row of honest-to-goodness function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LemsyG"&gt;There’s also a late-breaking rumor that Apple will put an actually good webcam inside these MacBook Pros. The disappointing webcams were really the only notable downside with the M1 MacBook Air and base-spec MacBook Pro, so that’s overdue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUoNvQ"&gt;The other side of that webcam rumor is talk that the MacBook Pros will have thinner bezels and therefore an actual notch for the webcam. That likely won’t mean it will use face unlock for unlocking the Mac — a feature many Windows computers have had for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAJy6O"&gt;What else? Tough to say! There are a handful of products that we’ve been expecting, ranging from new AirPods to updated Mac Minis — plus of course we need a final release date for macOS Monterey. We’ll be live blogging the whole event, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h8mNjQ"&gt;Apple Unleashed keynote live blog&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Apple’s ‘Unleashed’ Fall 2021 Mac Event: rumors, news, and announcements </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple October 18th event invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PmHxoyaa0VlCwLB0M0BQXVBBz0c=/94x0:1330x824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70010469/image__7_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT today&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Qjl0gC"&gt;Ever since the MacBook Pro line made significant departures from its winning formula with the introduction of the Touch Bar and the removal of MagSafe charging, people have been clamoring for a return to form. Last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1-powered MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; were a step in the right direction — as was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;revised M1 Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; — but there’s still room to revitalize the “Pro” in MacBook Pro. That is a big part of what’s expected at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;Apple’s next event&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed “Unleashed,” which is scheduled for Monday, October 18th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPOayy"&gt;The rumors have been widespread that Apple will be refreshing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pro with its own silicon&lt;/a&gt; and that a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;new 14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; will be the proper successor to the old 13-inch models long left behind with their MagSafe plugs, SD card slots, and an array of versatile I/O. With new MacBook Pros might also come a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;new, super-powered Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; that sports a revised design, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;third generation of the standard AirPods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORxf4H"&gt;Regardless of what’s announced, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will keep you updated on all the latest news and announcements to be “Unleashed” by Apple on October 18th, including all the rumors and news leading up to the virtual event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The M1 chip saved the MacBook — but now Apple has to win back the Pros</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4l2XlWncu_NJxoMg-48F50FA97w=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70010098/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XmKgkS"&gt;It’s been hard to be an Apple power user for the last half-decade. The glory days of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/13/3082649/macbook-pro-review-retina-display-15-inch"&gt;original Retina MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; have long since vanished into the sunset, and recent years have seen computers with too many compromises and too few ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sHmmI"&gt;And while Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;first wave of M1-powered computers&lt;/a&gt; have been excellent, they’ve all been — relatively — low-powered. The MacBook Air, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;M1 MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; are the cheapest computers Apple makes, meant more for checking email, writing essays, and the occasional light photo editing than they are for cranking out 4K video or Photoshop projects hundreds of layers deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGc7pu"&gt;That may be about to change with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;presumed announcement&lt;/a&gt; of new, high-end MacBook Pro models, computers that are rumored to be Apple’s biggest laptop update in years. And new MacBook Pros are an opportunity for the company to get back the professional users that have been underserved and disappointed by the lackluster laptop options that the company has been releasing for several cycles. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GiGuga82ESb5W11HZbajTPY8QeI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7461807/jbareham_161108_1263_0105.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;James Bareham&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="It3gls"&gt;Apple’s last major redesign for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13616404/apple-macbook-pro-touch-bar-review-2016-13-inch-15-inch-laptop"&gt;MacBook Pro came in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and made several missteps: the stripping away of SD card, HDMI, and USB-A ports (all essential tools for photographers, video editors, musicians, and other professional workers) in favor of exclusively using USB-C. There was the addition of the largely useless Touch Bar instead of reliable function keys. And, of course, the extremely fragile keyboard, which was prone to breaking on contact with dust or debris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQ213a"&gt;Subsequent models have tried to address some of those complaints (Apple finally reverted back to the older style keyboard and added a physical escape key to newer models of the MacBook Pro), but the overall approach of what should be Apple’s most functional devices still focus more on the form. Life as a professional on a Mac has meant dealing with too many dongles, buying new cables, and endlessly hunting around for an SD card adapter just to import files. All while getting processors that are years behind Windows devices, with screens that haven’t meaningfully changed since 2012, on computers that Apple charges a premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyk7gX"&gt;And hardcore users have been waiting for a while, especially compared to Apple’s last chip changeover. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;Apple first announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be transitioning its entire product lineup over to Apple Silicon products in 2020 (and away from the Intel chips that it had used since its last major architecture switch in 2005), it announced a two-year goal of getting all its products switched over. But a year in, and only Apple’s least powerful devices have made the change. If you want a more powerful laptop or desktop, then you’re still getting the old Intel models — models that, while still not on Apple Silicon hardware, also haven’t been updated with new &lt;em&gt;Intel&lt;/em&gt; hardware in over a year and a half either. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 16-inch MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2nqxLgoH1jWenTk56aWR8IE3Xw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19395182/vpavic_191118_3800_0077.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hblvj1"&gt;The most powerful 16-inch MacBook Pro you can buy right now — ostensibly Apple’s best and beefiest laptop — features a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950968/intel-9th-gen-core-chips-2018-desktop-processors-8-core-i9-9900k"&gt;9th-generation Intel Core i7 processor from early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Mac users aren’t just missing out on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;new 11th Gen Tiger Lake chips announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, bringing generational changes in battery life and performance; they didn’t even get the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21203222/intel-10th-gen-h-series-laptop-processors-comet-lake-14nm-5-ghz-clock-speeds-gaming"&gt;more modest upgrades&lt;/a&gt; from Intel’s 2020 10th-gen chips, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJxb3I"&gt;Compare this whole sluggish Apple Silicon transition to the original Intel one, which happened much more swiftly; Apple announced the change in June 2005, released the first Intel-based Macs in January 2006, and had completely switched over its full product line with the Intel-powered Mac Pro in August 2006 — just eight months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2sH5E"&gt;Apple managed to change its entire lineup to Intel in just over a year, from announcement to release, the last time around. But with Apple Silicon, we’re already a year into this transition, and there are still a lot of crucial, unanswered questions. The current M1 chips only offer integrated GPUs, with no discrete graphics options available for more graphically intensive tasks (like those that video editors or graphic designers might need). Apple doesn’t sell an M1 device with more than 16GB of RAM, nor does it offer a laptop with more than two USB4 / Thunderbolt 4 ports — all areas that the company would likely have to address in some fashion on a pro-focused machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XZas6"&gt;Plus, if Apple does fail at translating the success of its M1 chips to its more powerful machines, Intel is still ready and willing to try and pick up the slack. “I never give up on the idea of anything not running on Intel chips,” commented Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/axios/status/1449891228099694597"&gt;in an interview with Axios&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple decided that they could do a better chip than we could, and they did a pretty good job. So what I have to do is create a better chip than they can do themselves...  I’m gonna fight hard to win Tim [Cook’s] business in this area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tPsYqp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A year in, and there’s a lot of unanswered questions for professional-level Apple Silicon computers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1eL96N"&gt;There are theoretical benefits to the delay: developers have had a full year to transition their apps over to Apple’s M1 architecture. Things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176548/microsoft-office-native-m1-apps-apple-silicon-support"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584992/adobe-premiere-pro-apple-m1-support"&gt;key creative applications&lt;/a&gt; like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere, and Lightroom have all been natively ported to Apple’s new chips, and those updates took months to roll out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuS6ZX"&gt;Plus, a switch to Apple’s own in-house chips might not just mean the kind of performance and speed boosts that customers have been enjoying on the company’s less powerful machines. It also could mean an end to the glacial pace of upgrades for Mac processors. With Intel chips, Apple’s computers almost universally lagged behind their Windows-based competitors, taking months or even years to upgrade to Intel’s latest chips (and the performance and power benefits that newer silicon provided).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSxEtV"&gt;And if the rumors are correct, Apple is taking the new chips as an opportunity to roll out a new design for its MacBook Pro line, with bigger, better Mini LED displays, smaller bezels, more ports, and even the return of its breakaway magnetic MagSafe chargers — changes that would both modernize the lineup to be more on par with Windows competitors (which have long since lapped Apple in things like display technology) in addition to rolling back some of the more controversial aspects of the Touch Bar era. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um9Ija"&gt;With the first wave of Apple Silicon Macs, Apple proved it could make the best laptops around for &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people. But Apple’s new MacBook Pros aren’t just about winning over power users — it’s a chance to prove that Apple Silicon (and the traditionally mobile-focused Arm technology it uses) can not only match but exceed what Intel and AMD have accomplished for years with x86 for high-end use cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5Ephw"&gt;And if Apple can succeed at that, it won’t just mean better laptops or desktops, but what could be the start of changing how we fundamentally think about designing computers — at least the inside of them — going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
