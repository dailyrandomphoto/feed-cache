    <title>How to buy the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKF7xFC4hTYRm-7tz1b73WWCeWk=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857848/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the colors of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIBU9V"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;a fleet of new products at its “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;. Chief among them — you guessed it — was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. This one is coming in various sizes and colors, but with smaller notches, the new A15 Bionic chipset, and with redesigned and improved cameras located around the back. Going from smallest to largest, Apple will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and finally the iPhone 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;With the Pro and Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be able to get the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage, along with 120Hz refresh rate displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1YGEt"&gt;If you’re looking forward to ordering any of the four iPhone 13 models, the good news is you no longer need to preorder and wait around. If you haven’t already ordered one, there’s a good chance you pick one up from your local Apple store, or from your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIozlV"&gt;If you’re curious about all of the options and how much it’ll all cost, we’ve listed all of that info below for buying unlocked. All of the carrier-specific promos, including trade-in deals, are listed at the bottom of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7zyyJ"&gt;How to buy the iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7E96Ug"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is the 2021 iteration on the Mini phone form factor with a 5.4-inch OLED screen. Apple says that this newer version should get better battery life than the previous model. Battery life was one of the few disappointments in the iPhone 12 Mini, so it’s good that Apple seems to have made improvements here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytXyfk"&gt;Apple sells the iPhone 13 Mini starting with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $729&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to opt for more storage with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; versions for $829 or $1,029, respectively. If you purchase through a carrier via Apple’s site, the starting price of each configuration drops $30, starting at $699. If you want to trade in your phone, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check for its value right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nPdN53"&gt;How to order the iPhone 13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DVnDHN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 has a 6.1-inch OLED display, the same size as last year’s model. Like other models this year, Apple upgraded the internal chipset to the A15 Bionic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NHlw2"&gt;Buying them unlocked will cost you $30 more than buying through a carrier, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $829 for the 128GB version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$929 for the 256GB version&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,129 for the 512GB version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGvHEm"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find out your phone’s value at Apple&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in for credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BaJlBq"&gt;How to buy the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eBv8ru"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are the biggest and most capable models coming out of Apple in 2021. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch OLED display with an A15 Bionic chipset, while the Pro Max has a bigger 6.7-inch OLED. Both support up to 120Hz refresh rate, which is an improvement that’s long been anticipated. However, you’ll also pay a lot more for this model than the base iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAUxcl"&gt;At Apple, the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models start at $999 and $1,099, respectively. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; will run you $1,099, while the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; will cost $1,199. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration&lt;/a&gt; of either model will also cost an extra $200, with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,499 and the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,599. Unlike the iPhone 13 Mini and standard iPhone 13, there’s no $30 price difference if you choose to purchase the Pro line unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHpfYv"&gt;As mentioned before, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s site can tell you how much your current phone is worth&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wmtN87"&gt;iPhone 13 lineup carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jzmr1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; Current and new Verizon users can save on any of the iPhone 13 models with a trade-in if you’re on certain unlimited plans, billed back to you in monthly credits over the course of 24 or 30 months. New customers can get an additional $500 worth in credits by switching carriers to Verizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74PqP"&gt;How much you’ll get in trade-in credit varies depending on the phone you want, with up to $1,000 back in billing credits if you buy the iPhone 13 Pro Max and have an unlimited plan. If you’re after the 128GB iPhone 13 Pro that usually costs $999, trading in select phones can make it free after you’ve received billing credits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n71NlO"&gt;If you want the iPhone 13, Verizon will offer those on an unlimited plan up to $800 for a trade-in, and you’ll get reimbursed via billing credits. For an iPhone 13 Mini, trade in values cap at $700.  &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.verizon.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKEbcd"&gt;According to a Verizon spokesperson, these are the phones that will get the most amount of trade-in value (though the carrier will accept most phones in any condition, but battery damage is a deal-breaker): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vp61Ou"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="R3SAWq"&gt;These are the mid-tier devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xce8xP"&gt;Apple: iPhone X and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u4VbAe"&gt;Samsung: GS9 and Note 9 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OSmNtc"&gt;Google: Pixel 4A and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lcmacj"&gt;Kyocera: DuraForce Ultra &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5PQFGX"&gt;LG: V50 ThinQ and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3IkQLY"&gt;Motorola: Moto One 5G, RAZR, Edge Plus &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FgPHff"&gt;Nokia: 8 V 5G &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a1j0LX"&gt;OnePlus: 7 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UxtFME"&gt;Sony: Xperia 1 and up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jp0kUn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; New and existing T-Mobile users can get up to $800 in trade-in credit toward an iPhone 13 series phone. This deal is available for customers on the Max plan, and you’ll get the credit paid back to you in 30 monthly bill credits. T-Mobile’s “Forever Upgrade” initiative will let Max plan holders get up to $800 in trade-in credit for future trade-ins, including this one. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-iphone-deals%2Fupgrade-benefits&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665165%2Fapple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit T-Mobile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nQiuJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; New and current AT&amp;amp;T subscribers on an unlimited plan who trade in a phone, then purchase an iPhone 13 series phone on an installment plan can get a good deal after all of the billing credits have come in. You can get up to $1,000 in billing credits if you trade in a phone that’s worth $180 or higher, making the iPhone 13 Pro Max a better deal. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-128gb-silver.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone is using old Jawbone patents to sue Apple and Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jawbone Up hands-on pictures (2012)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbFw6EXUFgunBve-hce0e2rfupA=/4x0:1021x678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902309/DSC_3053-hero.1353975716.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jawbone is best known for its fitness trackers, but the recent lawsuits focus on noise-isolation tech used in its earphones.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IaIozz"&gt;Wearables company Jawbone is long-dead — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15931080/jawbone-going-out-of-business-report"&gt;went out of business&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 — but its patents live on, and someone is using them to sue Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU1dh5"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/jawbone-ghost-rises-to-sue-google-apple-over-ear-pods-phones?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, an entity named Jawbone Innovations LLC filed lawsuits against the two tech giants this week in federal court in Waco, Texas. The suits allege that Apple and Google infringed eight patents previously belonging to Jawbone and focused around noise-isolation algorithms originally developed for DARPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8Q2uT"&gt;The suit against Apple names the infringing devices as “all versions and variants of Apple iPhone, iPad, AirPods Pro, and HomePod products,” while the suit against Google is similarly broad, naming “all versions and variants of Google smartphones [...] tablets and/or notebooks [...], earbuds [...] smart home devices [...] and other Android Devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fepgoo"&gt;Both suits demand a preliminary injunction against the companies to stop them from selling the allegedly infringing products, and future royalties for the use of these patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E9JK7f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Who is behind the lawsuits is unclear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qEeawd"&gt;If all this seems like a little bit of legal skulduggery, well, who are we to disagree. As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, exactly who or what is behind the lawsuits is unclear, but it’s not the first time Jawbone Innovations LLC has made such claims. The same entity — which does not appear to be contiguous in any meaningful way with the original Jawbone, apart from owning the latter’s intellectual property — &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/jawbone-samsung-patent-infringement-lawsuit"&gt;sued Samsung&lt;/a&gt; in June for similar infringements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epE8Rd"&gt;And, as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/jawbone-samsung-patent-infringement-lawsuit"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in its reporting of that case, the manager of Jawbone Innovations LLC, one &lt;a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_tx/0803920236"&gt;York Eggleston&lt;/a&gt;, also seems to have prior form, with an individual of that name also managing other LLCs that were &lt;a href="https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/patent/968064/additional-former-ibm-patents-move-from-daedalus-to-another-npe"&gt;assigned old IBM patents&lt;/a&gt; before suing Lyft and Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIxmUO"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes, filing such lawsuits in Waco, Texas makes sense, as it’s “a district that’s the most popular in the nation for its patent-friendly judge and juries.” Though even the patent-friendly might reject these particular claims. A spokesperson for Google told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg: “&lt;/em&gt;We dispute the claims, and will defend ourselves vigorously.” We’ve reached out to Apple for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVKAQu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Update your new iPhones and iPads to avoid Apple Music bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFhpQs54LkPY18tEIBEcAT9nbDc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902301/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dwikbh"&gt;If you’re an Apple Music user and recently bought a new iPhone 13 model, new ninth-generation iPad, or a sixth-generation iPad Mini, there’s an important update to download to avoid an annoying bug. A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212822"&gt;Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; says a bug affecting those devices restored from a backup can prevent users from accessing the Apple Music catalog, Apple Music settings, or using the services’s Sync Library feature. My colleague Chris Welch reports that he ran into this bug on iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYGNZS"&gt;Thankfully, the fix is very simple, according to Apple. Just head into the “General” section of the “Settings” app, select the “Software Update” option and hit “Install Now,” to get the update. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/apple-music-backup-restore-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that its release notes don’t explicitly mention the Apple Music bug, but this is presumably the update Apple’s support page is referencing. Apple says applying the update should resolve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s rumored MacBook Pros could get higher resolution screens, according to beta leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40xb5PsG1u-8jRMbXPaKh99SQPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69901962/akramer_201113_4290_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hwGEpi"&gt;The latest macOS Monterey beta contains clues about the resolution of Apple’s rumored 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/macbook-pro-2021-resolutions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The seventh beta of the upcoming operating system contains references to “3456 x 2234 Retina” and “3024 x 1964 Retina,” which are two resolutions not supported in any of Apple’s current Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxCILs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; theorizes that the two new resolutions correspond to Apple’s much rumored 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;widely expected to launch this year&lt;/a&gt; with new designs and a new Arm-based Apple processor called the M1X. For reference, the current 16-inch MacBook Pro has a resolution of 3072 x 1920, while the current 13-inch MacBook Pro’s display sits at 2560 x 1600. If the new resolutions are accurate, both laptops should see an increase in pixel density as well as screen resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vPIvM"&gt;As well as the improved screen resolutions, both laptops are rumored to feature a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;revived magnetic MagSafe laptop charger&lt;/a&gt; and the return of useful &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;ports like an SD card slot and HDMI&lt;/a&gt;. The widely disliked OLED Touch Bar is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;reportedly on the way out&lt;/a&gt;. The new laptops are expected to be announced at an Apple event this year, although an exact date is yet to be made public. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Foundation starts out big, lavish, and a little boring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="foundation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvKacf-rlGQCP1xdw8IkO1--dLk=/480x0:3360x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69901315/Foundation_Photo_010113.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Verge editors discuss the debut episodes of Apple TV Plus’ new series&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="g0GpOd"&gt;Ever since &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, every network seems to want something similar: an expensive genre epic that they can point to as &lt;em&gt;our big thing&lt;/em&gt;. This is especially true in the world of streaming. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;Netflix has &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388035/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-lotr-tv-series-production-cost-season-1"&gt;Amazon is spending an unseemly amount on &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple has &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, a sci-fi series based on the classic Isaac Asimov novels that kicks off with two episodes on September 24th. (New episodes will debut weekly on Apple TV Plus after that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGVc5q"&gt;In many ways, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; fits that tentpole epic formula quite well. It’s a story about the downfall of a galactic empire, with lots of political intrigue to follow. It’s also a lavish production, with incredible special effects and gorgeous production design. You can tell it’s expensive in every frame. Apple clearly has big plans for it; showrunner David S. Goyer &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210920-foundation-the-unfilmable-sci-fi-epic-now-on-our-screens"&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; that he’s plotted out eight seasons already. But it’s also a pretty weird story, one where you’ll spend more time seeing people doing calculations than anything resembling action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POoZ8Z"&gt;Ahead of the premiere, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editors Chaim Gartenberg and Andrew Webster were able to watch the first two episodes to determine just how interesting a space epic about math can really be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wS5PR3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s not easy to sum up what &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; is about, but I’ll try. To start, the main “character” isn’t actually a person, but rather a kind of math. At the center of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s story is something called psychohistory, which is a way of using mathematics to analyze the behaviors of large populations. In this world, that means you can whip out a calculator to predict the future in broad strokes, which is exactly what a man named Hari Seldon (Jared Harris) does. As the universe’s foremost expert on psychohistory, he reveals that the Galactic Empire, run by a constant succession of clones (each of which is played by a menacing Lee Pace), is approaching its downfall, which will be followed by thousands of years of barbarism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUArXN"&gt;The emperor doesn’t like that, so Hari and his followers — including fellow numbers whiz Gaal Dornick (Lou Llobell), who won a galaxy-wide math competition just to meet Hari — are exiled to a cold, mostly barren planet at the far reaches of the known universe. There they plan to set up the titular Foundation, with the goal of creating a repository of knowledge that might otherwise be lost during the long, dark period of galactic decline. The first two episodes primarily follow Hari’s initial prediction and exile, along with a terrorist attack on the capital planet Trantor, which seems to signal this period of decline that he predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4k7PMrS5jf_EG7VGcESGn9tNtAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873148/Foundation_Photo_010110.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nMII3n"&gt;It’s a lot to squeeze into two-ish hours, and for me it felt like I was getting one long history lesson. The show never really stopped to give me time to care about any of the characters. Fittingly, for a show about math, it was often cold and sterile. Seldon, in particular, feels very detached from the very people he’s trying to save. It doesn’t help that there’s just &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; math talk in the show. People say things like “math doesn’t take sides” and “people lie, numbers don’t” with a straight face, and Gaal is constantly reciting prime numbers in order to relax. At one point, when the Foundation is discussing which parts of various cultures they need to preserve, Gaal goes on a long diatribe about base 10. It’s like being back in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a0REo"&gt;What did you think, Chaim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggGgxy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve got similar mixed feelings about the start of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;. The choice of a more traditional TV series feels like an odd one for the series, given the anthology nature of the source material. (Each “book” is a series of short stories that breaks up the thousand-year scope of the story.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7XMY7"&gt;Instead, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; seems to — at least for now — be taking a far more leisurely approach to its adaptation, expanding on the fall of the Empire instead of jumping ahead along the timeline. It’s possible that events will accelerate over the course of the show. There’s a flash-forward early on that indicates that we’ll be seeing more of the story at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sICTSC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, the book, tells readers that the Galactic Empire will fall and that the encyclopedia will eventually be written. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, the show, is intent on showing every step of that process — and like Andrew said, arguing over an encyclopedia is not overly interesting fodder for a TV show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxUCye"&gt;I do love the sheer size and scope of the show, though: the visual effects look stunning, with massive space elevators and uniquely designed ships that help the series stand out from contemporaries like &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEq9_5Ksddz3jcIrPh6gsFvCTTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873150/Foundation_Photo_010201.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2o1G85"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: I definitely agree that the show looks incredible. But more than just being aesthetically pleasing, the visuals contribute to the worldbuilding. This really does look and feel like a society that’s composed of many, many different alien cultures, and one that’s been around for a very long time. You can see it in the elaborate costumes — half of the characters look like they just stepped out of the Met Gala — and some of the strange tech. One of my favorite elements is a kind of living painting that needs to be constantly touched up by a skilled craftsman; the emperor even uses it to show off just how advanced his culture is when people come to visit from off-world. It’s a universe that feels real and lived-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSy6Pr"&gt;The problem is, after two episodes, I just don’t care much about anyone in that world. Pace’s emperor is extremely fun to watch, a methodically cutthroat dictator who seems to tower over everyone around him while decked out in blue superhero armor. But no one else has really grabbed me, particularly Seldon and his slightly removed nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VeMor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: 100 percent agreed on Pace, who is absolutely perfect dancing between callousness and charisma as Brother Day. The other pieces of the imperial triumvirate don’t quite measure up, but I like the concept in theory, if not 100 percent in practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLEyVP"&gt;But I think part of my bigger issue with the show is Seldon and psychohistory as a whole. It’s sort of like the kid at the playground who decides that his power is “always winning”; the very nature of the books (and therefore, the show) is that Seldon is always correct. He always has a plan; if he loses, that was the plan. And even if things go completely off the rails, well, there was a backup plan that he foresaw, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/haXMIIlYK8VmRfdd_-qDQWMJ0NE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873158/Foundation_Photo_010114.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N3PyGO"&gt;The Foundation loves to harp on math, which the show hangs onto as the ultimate form of logic and order. It’s a big part of Gaal’s backstory, how she gave up on what seems to be the Empire’s primary dogmatic religion to learn math instead. But &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s math is so esoteric that it’s effectively just sorcery of its own. It’s so complex that no one else on the show can even understand the swirls of dots that make up Seldon’s “Prime Radian” calculator; it’s so advanced that only Seldon and Gaal are the only ones smart enough to comprehend its intricacies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBEMwT"&gt;It’s no wonder that so many people want to kill him, honestly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMQc1L"&gt;I’m curious what you’d want to get out of the rest of the show — more of Gaal, Hari, and Raych (Alfred Enoch) building the Foundation on Trantor? A deeper dive into imperial politics with the emperors and the crumbling of empire? A jump forward in time? It feels like there are a lot of ways the rest of the season (or seasons) could go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iJ85UT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: Just give me some interesting characters! I’d love to see some of the more normal members of the Foundation as they set up a new life on a harsh alien world (we get a slight hint of that in episode 2), as well as how the downfall impacts people on any of the myriad planets that are part of the empire, especially those far-removed from the capital’s decadence. There’s a lot of space, both figuratively and literally, to explore here. The show just needs a little warmth to balance out the evil dictators and intergalactic mathletes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’re not allowed to use the Apple Watch Series 7’s secret wireless dock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mrspCCQMkptU4dH4HNr5f2VCuoo=/74x0:820x497/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900466/Capto_Capture_2021_09_14_01_24_25_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VvQLwt"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 has a new 60.5GHz module that works with a secret, corresponding dock, &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;amp;application_id=HHHbKs1F5u4RgO0KGUvULQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;fcc_id=BCG-A2476"&gt;according to FCC filings&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/apple-watch-60-5-ghz-wireless-data-transfer/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new wireless data transfer feature is designed to pair with a corresponding dock that Apple will use for currently unknown internal purposes. When the Series 7 watch is placed on that pad, it’ll activate the module — customers won’t actually be able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RenDoU"&gt;Now, this is technically nothing new for the Apple Watch, which has included a hidden physical diagnostic port since its inception. Without actually seeing an Apple Watch Series 7 in person (and checking to see if Apple is removing the physical port), it’s hard to say whether this is some new, nascent Apple technology or just a more convenient method for running hardware diagnostics for Genius Bar employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gZFTW5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"EU proposes mandatory USB-C on all devices, including iPhones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6FlYkw"&gt;But the news comes just as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;European Commission has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to require all smartphone manufacturers to exclusively use USB-C ports on their devices in an effort to reduce e-waste. Combined with existing rumors that Apple has plans to remove all the ports on its iPhones — something that would be a more pressing concern if Apple was looking to sidestep the new EU proposal — and there’s been a lot of theorizing around the new 60.5GHz tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9zREm"&gt;The argument is that Apple could potentially be looking to incorporate the new wireless data transfer technology into its existing charging standards, like MagSafe, on a future iPhone, selling a proprietary dock that enables wireless data transfer to a linked computer to replace a physical Lightning cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i3WYQp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pretty timely piece of news! To me, this pretty much confirms 1) future iPhones will be port-less, and 2) that Lightning will be replaced with a 60.5GHz wireless USB-substitute through a MagSafe-like attachment. I’m surprised this was added to Apple Watch first? iPhone teardown? &lt;a href="https://t.co/vqqMIEx0yW"&gt;https://t.co/vqqMIEx0yW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1441087270627336196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fSZpvx"&gt;It’s a theory that has some merit; the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt; port-less iPhone rumors&lt;/a&gt; have been around for a while, and they come from the generally accurate analyst &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to imagine Apple giving in and suddenly offering a USB-C iPhone that would circumvent both its MFi licensing fees and its control over its most important (and lucrative) devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyItQa"&gt;That said, the timing is probably a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; convenient here; it seems highly unlikely that Apple was working to lay the groundwork for a replacement standard that would slot neatly into a port-less iPhone, revealed on the exact day that the EU standard was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDQYqH"&gt;There are also plenty of past internal Apple features that have similarly never come to fruition for any compelling consumer use. There’s the aforementioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8543033/apple-watch-hidden-port-charging-battery-strap"&gt;Apple Watch diagnostic port&lt;/a&gt;, which has lain dormant for half a decade now despite dreams of battery life-extending bands and other accessories. Or, consider the Apple TV’s hidden USB-C or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/17/apple-tv-4k-lightning-port/"&gt;Lightning ports&lt;/a&gt;, which can’t even accomplish a task as simple as charging an Apple TV remote after all these years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKlxHf"&gt;Then again, one never does know with Apple. If the company &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;looking to ditch charging ports — due to EU rules or its own whims — then it’s possible the new 60.5GHz module is a first look at how Apple will attempt to accomplish it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94SLKe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPadOS 15 ruined my iPad’s homescreen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ediFrrEth4WP4a4mUR1Txvld0dw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897795/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDjasA"&gt;There’s a lot of promise and potential in iPadOS 15. Even with some features like SharePlay missing from the initial release, others like Quick Note and a dramatically simpler approach to multitasking already improve the day-to-day experience of using Apple’s tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNeARK"&gt;But Apple sure did manage to bungle the homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Us0h3"&gt;As my colleague Chaim mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;in his review of iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, the homescreen layout is no longer consistent between vertical and horizontal orientations. I’ve been using the 12.9-inch iPad Pro since 2018, and as of iPadOS 14, the homescreen grid was always 6 x 5 no matter how the iPad was being held. This allowed me to set up dedicated rows for things like photo editing (I edit many of my review photos on the iPad), audio apps, video apps, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Y7qdEYsDxwihGVkkhPjVAB1B28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871871/iPadOS14Home.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See how icon positioning stayed the same on iPadOS 14? That was nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LvsNsI"&gt;But with iPadOS 15, Apple threw a wrench into all that. When the iPad is in landscape mode, I still get the 6 x 5 layout. But now, as soon as I switch to vertical / portrait, the grid inexplicably changes to 5 x 6, with icons flowing down into the row below them. So much for my attempts at organization and keeping things tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgylnT"&gt;It’s a frustrating change, and it results in a very obvious amount of wasted space at the sides of the screen. The icon spacing in vertical orientation gets almost comical on this large, pixel-rich display if you do drop in some widgets, as you’ll see later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89h7yM"&gt;The best explanation I’ve seen for this reduction in icon density is that it was necessary to support the more flexible widget placement and still keep everything looking somewhat uniform and aesthetically pleasing. It also has to do with how Apple maps out widgets on the homescreen. In his review of iOS and iPadOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Federico Viticci surmised that Apple chose to “return to a non-dense grid that allows for both widgets and icons at the same time.” But I’m just not on board. Particularly on iPads, we’re at the point where at least having the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; for a more tightly-packed grid would unlock new promise and creativity. Apple still doesn’t even permit empty gaps between icons or widgets. Instead, the company remains weirdly dedicated to its restrictive, always-from-the-top-left placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYVlXj"&gt;I’m sure there are many fantastic widgets out there at this point, and the new XL size — exclusive to the iPad — does open up more possibilities for calendar widgets and other productivity tools. But personally, I just don’t find myself using them often, and I was perfectly okay with the old style of keeping widgets anchored to the left of the main homescreen, where they could be pulled into view when needed and then easily dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7Bo9TghTSuk_fKEwrSbEuWyUSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871872/iPadOS14widgets.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPadOS 14 only supported widgets in the “today view.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ujVpY6"&gt;But then we move on to iPadOS 15. And my first criticism comes right at the start. For some reason, Apple finds it appropriate to plop several widgets onto your iPad’s homescreen immediately after the update, which will throw whatever ordering you had before into disarray. It looks quite bad. Here’s mine on first boot following the iPadOS 15 upgrade, where in portrait we drop from five columns to four... on a 12.9-inch screen… all for the purpose of showcasing widgets:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pgAcDmSv2KTwqXYcaRkjgbuodA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871875/iPadOS15firstboot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homescreen chaos. What a wonderful introduction to a new software update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zhuJxE"&gt;Yikes. What a ham-fisted way of introducing a new feature to customers. Why not just &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; these more flexible, put-them-where-you-want widgets in a post-update video instead of wrecking actual homescreens? I’d be irked if some macOS update dumped a bunch of random junk onto my desktop, and I’m similarly annoyed by what Apple’s done here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RdruIX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I can’t be the only iPad user to install iPadOS 15 and frown at seeing how its home screen widgets broke up a painstakingly-organized app icon grid.&lt;/p&gt;— Rob Pegoraro (@robpegoraro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robpegoraro/status/1440091473496707072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tRFFgE"&gt;It also illustrates the significant tradeoff that comes with widgets: as soon as you add even one, no matter the size, you’re down to just four columns for that homescreen in portrait mode. On a display as expansive as the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, that’s brutal. And again, it’s all because of Apple’s fixation with the grid. This is a problem of the company’s own making. At least you can cram a ton of apps into the dock, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="af2GHX"&gt;With a little rearranging, I was able to get back to where things were before — but only in the landscape orientation. As I mentioned earlier, portrait is now limited to a 5 x 6 grid (even when no widgets are present), and there’s no setting to change this back to the old layout. All that wasted space. And for what? This is even noticeable on smaller iPads; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/T-UhbAcZd3I"&gt;in his review of the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, Marques Brownlee couldn’t help but notice the padding on both sides of the homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYtdK61eQa2zjm3-9dsMUBgOjhM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871888/Screen_Shot_2021_09_23_at_8.58.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-UhbAcZd3I" target="_blank"&gt;MKBHD (YouTube)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the new iPad Mini has wasted homescreen potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9VXBK"&gt;It’s fair to point out that in iPadOS 14, there was wasted screen real estate at the top and bottom of the icon grid when in vertical orientation. But I think it’s far better for familiarity and muscle memory to maintain the same app positioning and layout in both scenarios, so I found that acceptable. This? Not so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lYkfB3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPadOS15?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPadOS15&lt;/a&gt; widget and icon placement is absolute madness, especially when changing orientation &lt;a href="https://t.co/wQrFZ7rXYK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wQrFZ7rXYK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dan Finnen (@danfinnen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danfinnen/status/1440039844349034499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz5IAj"&gt;What frustrates me most about the new homescreen is that it’s impossible to make rows for specific purposes, since one icon will always reflow into the next row when you hold the iPad in portrait. Sure, folders exist, but that’s an extra tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIUoB3"&gt;Some have pointed out that iPadOS 15 now allows you to customize totally separate layouts for the homescreen when in portrait and landscape, and it will remember what goes where as you switch between them. So you can create a different look for each orientation. That’s neat! But the initial jumbled mess when changing orientations is jarring, and having separate layouts doesn’t fix the issue of icons jumping around. Currently, you can’t delete an icon or widget from one layout and keep it in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0GIR-UTJDerc9Xq59_BdkVltJdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871876/iPadOS15Home.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With iPadOS 15, the homescreen is 6 x 5 in landscape and 5 x 6 in portrait. (Total icons vary by iPad type and screen size.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="38hdG4"&gt;As of the new update, Apple has also ditched the convenient landscape “today view” that displayed the date and time with widgets underneath — all while keeping your apps in easy reach. Your choices now are to put widgets directly on the homescreen or, if you prefer to keep them off, you can swipe right for this blurred slide-over version, which is &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;, but less elegant:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U1C_itHJ5DiQ7TDYRbxGyelyOhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871878/iPadOS15widgets.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The nice homescreen today view is gone, but you can still slide in widgets from the left if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W5lKba"&gt;Some will see this as a very minor inconvenience and carry on with updating to iPadOS 15 for all of the other benefits. Since the App Library is now there, you can even go in the complete &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; direction and load your homescreens up with widgets everywhere and only a few app icons. If that’s you, don’t let me stop you. On the whole, it’s a very good release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5qRVB"&gt;But I’m really hoping in a future software update, Apple will add a setting to restore the old layout that kept everything more consistent. It’d be even better if the company made the grid more customizable on the whole. If we’re letting people choose between new and old Safari designs, why not offer a choice between having more things on-screen or a less dense grid that’s better optimized for widgets? There’s already a “Home Screen and Dock” section in settings, after all. Letting you adjust the grid to your liking is something that Android phones and tablets already get right. It’s not a huge ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2xBhv"&gt;For me, widgets aren’t worth the homescreen looking different based on how I’m holding my iPad. And I’m not alone, with other iPad owners on &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-15-we-are-stuck-with-6x5-apps-on-home-screen-now.2299988/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadPro/comments/pskv7t/ios_15_only_5_icons_per_row/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere venting about these changes. Some of them have downgraded back to iPadOS 14.8 until there’s a solution. I’ve now done so for the second time (I needed those screenshots) even if I’ll miss Quick Note, the much-improved multitasking, and other refinements of iPadOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7OWzt"&gt;I don’t know how long I’ll stay on the older software. Once iPadOS 15 is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/psplhz/i_dont_want_them_to_fix_this_ipados_15/"&gt;a little more polished&lt;/a&gt; or adds SharePlay back in, I might update. But a familiar homescreen that works the way I expect counts for a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The EU’s USB-C proposal might give us a portless iPhone instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EqbGbSGmH85GkDjjYs0cJoIf2Gs=/244x0:2545x1534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897757/Screen_Shot_2017_09_14_at_11.51.30_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OBqCUT"&gt;The European Commission has announced plans to force smartphone and other electronics manufacturers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;fit a common USB-C charging port&lt;/a&gt; on their devices. Given that most Android-powered smartphones now ship with a USB-C port, the proposals could see Apple finally be forced to move to USB-C on the iPhone. Or they might not, as they could instead force Apple to deliver a portless iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSAFOc"&gt;Today’s proposals from the EU only cover wired charging and don’t seek to enforce rules on wireless charging just yet. A spokesperson for the Commission has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that if a device charges only wirelessly, then there is no requirement to integrate a USB-C charging port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsiayr"&gt;If the European Parliament adopts the proposals, manufacturers will have 24 months to comply with the new rules. That gives Apple a lot of time to create a portless iPhone if it wants to avoid USB-C altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Lightning connector stock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgBlGYJBs257ZkkwLiaYzRGZVP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/1362261/lightningapple.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Lightning connector has existed for nearly 10 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYjoXg"&gt;Apple has notoriously avoided USB-C on the iPhone, despite adopting it on many iPad and MacBook models. While the EU says its proposals are driven by environmental incentives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;Apple has argued&lt;/a&gt; that a switch to USB-C would actually be worse for the environment because it renders hundreds of millions of Lightning accessories obsolete. These arguments might be irrelevant if Apple goes portless, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZOLVj"&gt;Rumors of an iPhone without any ports have circulated for years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage"&gt;Apple had the “courage”&lt;/a&gt; to kill off the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and make it clear wireless was the future for headphones. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;analysts originally predicted&lt;/a&gt; that this year’s iPhone would ship without any ports, ditching the Lightning port in favor of wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojIaWa"&gt;That clearly hasn’t happened with the iPhone 13, but it doesn’t mean it’s not far off. The world of wireless charging is increasingly complicated, and interoperability isn’t always guaranteed, but things are moving quickly. The OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50W wireless charging, meaning the phone will fully charge in 43 minutes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;Xiaomi also announced&lt;/a&gt; its next salvo in the wireless charging wars last year, thanks to an 80W wireless charger. Xiaomi claims it can charge a 4,000mAh battery fully in just 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LOzlCNU7jLmQ2z3t-6SttSCcSNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9241503/airpower.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirPower didn’t work out for Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U7SEIJ"&gt;Apple’s experiences with wireless charging haven’t been as impressive, though. Apple’s AirPower wireless charger was supposed to arrive with the unique ability to charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all at the same time. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple canceled AirPower in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;, citing difficulties in bringing the product to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJaFRk"&gt;The new iPhone 13 Pro supports wireless charging over the Qi standard at up to 7.5 watts and up to 15 watts using MagSafe wireless charging. Both of these are still slower than the fast-charge capable cables you can use to charge an iPhone with. Like anything Apple, the company is probably prototyping better wireless charging methods that will follow years after the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJpOT8"&gt;Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that Apple has no plans to ditch the Lightning port on the iPhone in “the foreseeable future” and could move straight to a portless iPhone that relies exclusively on its MagSafe wireless charging standard instead. “If the ‌iPhone‌ abandons Lightning in the future, it may directly adopt a portless design with ‌MagSafe‌ support instead of using a USB-C port,“ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;said Kuo earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ny6ArzeT0abX7U_ZwlO2TJfb_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863285/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro ships with a Lightning port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gGULFs"&gt;Such a move could be driven by Apple’s desire to protect its MFi licensing business instead of moving to USB-C. Apple makes money off of every Lightning cable and accessory sold by way of licensing fees from the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/"&gt;MFi accessory program&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also controls the MagSafe standard through its MFi program, ensuring it captures licensing fees on some wireless charging accessories for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHV8aM"&gt;If Apple is able to move to a portless iPhone before the two-year grace period from the European Commission, it could still be on a collision course for future clashes over charging standards, though. While the EU admits wireless charging is “not seen as a replacement for wired charging at the moment because of the efficiency rates of such chargers,” it does leave the door open to look at this technology at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1G4PP"&gt;“It is also necessary to provide the basis for adaption to any future technological progress by introducing a harmonization of the charging interfaces and the charging communication protocols with respect to radio equipment that may be charged via any means other than wired charging, including charging via radio waves (wireless charging),” says the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATH9yl"&gt;If Apple continues to support the Qi wireless charging standard, then it could avoid further scrutiny if it does move to a portless iPhone in the future. But if MagSafe comes to dominate, we could be back in an EU battle over charging standards once again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU proposes mandatory USB-C on all devices, including iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCEmgidSQ1-b0N-UgeM6bxRttrY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897030/akrales_190522_3440_0067.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="27m3HK"&gt;The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613"&gt;has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to force smartphone and other electronics manufacturers to fit a common USB-C charging port on their devices. The proposal is likely to have the biggest impact on Apple, which continues to use its proprietary Lightning connector rather than the USB-C connector adopted by most of its competitors. The rules are intended to cut down on electronic waste by allowing people to re-use existing chargers and cables when they buy new electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KcrXf"&gt;In addition to phones, the rules will apply to other devices like tablets, headphones, portable speakers, videogame consoles, and cameras. Manufacturers will also be forced to make their fast-charging standards interoperable, and to provide information to customers about what charging standards their device supports. Under the proposal, customers will be able to buy new devices without an included charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVElTN"&gt;The proposals only cover devices using wired, not wireless, chargers, EU commissioner Thierry Breton said in a press conference, adding that “there is plenty of room for innovation on wireless.” A spokesperson for the Commission subsequently confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that a USB-C port is only mandatory for devices that charge using a cable. But, if a device charges exclusively via wireless, like Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;rumored portless iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, there’d be no requirement for a USB-C charging port. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PYk9tbl2orhrRkTWOAiYksl-R1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871784/image__5_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An EU infographic on the proposed rules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0OZTOD"&gt;To become law, the revised Radio Equipment Directive proposal will need to pass a vote in the European Parliament. If adopted, manufacturers will eventually have 24 months to comply with the new rules. The parliament has already &lt;a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200128IPR71205/parliament-wants-binding-rules-on-common-chargers-to-be-tabled-by-summer"&gt;voted in favor&lt;/a&gt; of new rules on a common charger in early 2020, indicating that today’s proposal should have broad support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8R3VV5"&gt;“Chargers power all our most essential electronic devices. With more and more devices, more and more chargers are sold that are not interchangeable or not necessary. We are putting an end to that,” said commissioner Thierry Breton. “With our proposal, European consumers will be able to use a single charger for all their portable electronics – an important step to increase convenience and reduce waste.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKOT4v"&gt;“European consumers were frustrated long enough about incompatible chargers piling up in their drawers. We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger,” European Commission executive vice-president Margrethe Vestager said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GAh1Qy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Are your chargers piling up in a drawer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We propose a common charger for mobile phones and other similar electronic devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A single charger will be more convenient for people and will reduce electronic waste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/hkspfjwlhu"&gt;https://t.co/hkspfjwlhu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigitalEU?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DigitalEU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZhWZ8xSGKH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZhWZ8xSGKH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— European Commission    (@EU_Commission) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1440996773653323782?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vHUX30"&gt;Today’s proposal is focused on the charging port on the device end, but the Commission says it eventually hopes to ensure “full interoperability” on both ends of the cable. The power supply end will be addressed in a review to be launched later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5EQLC"&gt;The proposals follow a vote in the European Parliament &lt;a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200128IPR71205/parliament-wants-binding-rules-on-common-chargers-to-be-tabled-by-summer"&gt;in January 2020&lt;/a&gt; when lawmakers voted for new rules on common chargers. As of 2016, the amount of electronic waste produced across the bloc amounted to around 12.3 million metric tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snb9BS"&gt;The biggest impact of the new rules is likely to be felt by Apple, which continues to ship phones with a Lightning connector as opposed to the increasingly universal USB-C port. As of 2018, around 29 percent of phone chargers sold in the EU used USB-C, 21 percent used Lightning, and around half used the older Micro USB standard, according to an &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-propose-legislation-common-mobile-161928494.html"&gt;EU assessment reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These proportions are likely to have shifted considerably as USB-C has replaced Micro USB across all but the least expensive Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrEim9"&gt;Efforts to get smartphone manufacturers to use the same charging standard in the EU date back to at least 2009, when Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and Nokia &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-09-european-unions-one-charger-for-all-starts-sampling.html"&gt;signed a voluntary agreement&lt;/a&gt; to use a common standard. In the following years, the industry gradually adopted Micro USB and, more recently, USB-C as a common charging port. However, despite reducing the amount of charging standards from over 30 down to just three (Micro USB, USB-C, and Lightning), regulators have said this voluntary approach has fallen short of its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNtfm8"&gt;Apple was a notable outlier in that it never included a Micro USB port on its phones directly. Instead, it offered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/10/4/2469886/apple-releases-micro-usb-adapter-for-iphone"&gt;Micro USB to 30-pin adapter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyFInq"&gt;Apple said it disagreed with today’s proposals in a statement. “We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,” a spokesperson from the company &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/eu-plans-one-mobile-charging-port-all-setback-apple-2021-09-23/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;previously objected to the proposals&lt;/a&gt; because it says they risk creating e-waste by forcing people to throw out their existing Lightning accessories if they’re incompatible with the universal standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZ6VGs"&gt;Although it’s continued to use Lightning, Apple has made its own efforts to reduce charger e-waste. Last year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;stopped shipping charging bricks or earbuds in the box with new iPhones&lt;/a&gt; and supplied them only with a Lightning to USB-C cable. However, the move was met with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;mixed response&lt;/a&gt;, with some arguing that it helped Apple’s bottom line more than the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNBqMJ"&gt;While European lawmakers focus mainly on wired chargers, wireless charging is becoming increasingly popular across smartphones and has largely converged on a single cross-platform standard: Qi. There have even been rumors that Apple could ship an iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/"&gt;without a Lightning port&lt;/a&gt; and have it rely entirely on wireless charging for power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1PTil"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 23rd, 9:22AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note Breton’s comments about wireless chargers from Q&amp;amp;A, and confirmation that a completely wireless phone would not need to include USB-C. Also added comment from Apple. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqNtaO"&gt;As part of this week’s launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15, iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, Apple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1mmydqta&amp;amp;1632329842"&gt;also introduced StoreKit 2&lt;/a&gt;, a set of APIs for in-app purchases and subscriptions. The new Swift-based tools could help developers better track and support the purchases their users make instead of relying on third-party solutions like RevenueCat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlDZfh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/storekit/"&gt;The kit introduces new APIs&lt;/a&gt; to “determine product entitlements and eligibility for offers, quickly get a user’s history of in-app purchases, find out the latest status of a subscription with one simple check,” and most importantly, offer a way for users to manage subscriptions and request refunds in-app. Apple is also updating the App Store server API and App Store server notifications so developers can know when a user’s subscription expires in real time and possibly offer a free extension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2ba86u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Better customer support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMVmx3"&gt;As RevenueCat notes in &lt;a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/meet-storekit-2"&gt;a blog post breaking down Apple’s changes&lt;/a&gt;, StoreKit 2’s features only work when on devices running newer software like iOS 15. Apps that still support older versions of Apple’s OS — and most of them will for quite a while — &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/682105"&gt;are encouraged to use the original StoreKit&lt;/a&gt;. This divide could grow over time: Apple is allowing users &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/apple-will-let-users-stay-on-ios-14-and-receive-security-updates-even-after-ios-15-is-released/"&gt;to stay on iOS 14 and just receive security updates&lt;/a&gt;, and given how long the company’s products last, there’s likely a lot of old iPads and iPhones kicking around. Luckily, StoreKit 2 and StoreKit are interoperable, “purchases made with the original StoreKit API will still be accessible through the new StoreKit 2 transaction and renewal info APIs,” Apple writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfvAi8"&gt;These changes could make it a lot easier to offer traditional customer support for the purchases made inside apps. For Apple, they’re another small enticement for developers to provide some kind of in-app purchase or subscription, which financially benefits the company thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;increasingly contentious 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
