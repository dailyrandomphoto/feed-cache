    <title>Apple launches public beta of macOS Monterey, bringing updates to FaceTime and Safari</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A MacBook Pro running macOS Monterey sits on a table in front of a window. The screen displays the Quick note app on top of a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CNYGStZnZP-kSXROO5wLnd6PJpY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530097/mchin_210701_4658_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a quick note? There’s an app for that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="juxc3a"&gt;The public beta of macOS 12 Monterey, Apple’s next big macOS release, is now available for download. The operating system has the same general look and feel as its predecessor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS 11 Big Sur&lt;/a&gt;, but it brings some new features and a number of tweaks to Apple’s most popular services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxcR1j"&gt;Before we get into this, friendly reminder that Monterey is, for now, a beta. It may not be the best idea to install on a primary device, as you might encounter bugs, unfinished features, and incompatibility with third-party apps. If you will be installing the program on your daily driver, make sure you’ve backed up anything you can’t afford to mess with first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2tJJv"&gt;For those who take the leap and install the public beta, the component Apple seems most excited about is its updates to FaceTime. My favorite of these is Portrait Mode, which blurs the background behind you while you’re speaking on a call (similarly to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;the iPhone’s feature with the same name&lt;/a&gt;). Portrait Mode didn’t always get everything — sometimes when there were multiple different surfaces behind me, it seemed to get a bit confused and leave some parts un-blurred. But it wasn’t difficult to find areas where the feature worked just fine. Apple says Portrait Mode will be available for adoption in third-party apps as well, but we’ll have to wait for them to issue updates to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xI6srY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"},{"title":"How to install the macOS Monterey public beta","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a MacBook screen where a user is on a FaceTime call with a blurred bright bedroom background. A FaceTime drop-down menu is open in the top right with Portrait selected." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2NsKif8IbPqAUClq3MVExUI7Bcg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692197/IMG_9643.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;macOS Monterey’s new FaceTime Portrait Mode did a decent job of blurring out my background.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RPSdWc"&gt;Even though it’s had the ability to make group calls for a few years, I’ve always viewed FaceTime as a tool for calling one person at a time. But Monterey introduces a few other features that are clearly meant to make the tool a stronger Zoom competitor, conducive to meetings and larger calls. It now supports a grid view and Spatial Audio (which makes other people’s voices sound like they’re coming from the area on the screen where their face is positioned). You can generate a link to a FaceTime call ahead of time (the same way you generate a Zoom link), and users of Android and Windows can join from their browsers. And a new Voice Isolation feature uses machine learning to mitigate background noise while you’re speaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DK3OV"&gt;There’s a new feature called SharePlay, which is like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21191503/netflix-party-stream-movies-tv-chat-watch-friends-social-distance"&gt;Netflix Party&lt;/a&gt; or Scener but for FaceTime. Like Netflix Party, it allows you and other people on your FaceTime call to watch content from certain streaming services together by syncing everyone’s video playback and controls. (So we’re both watching the video on our own devices, with our own accounts. But when I pause or start, you pause or start as well.) SharePlay isn’t a new idea, but it’ll certainly be convenient to have on FaceTime. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;list of supported services&lt;/a&gt; includes some big players (such as Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max, Paramount Plus, Twitch, Pluto TV, and — hilariously — TikTok), it doesn’t appear to include Netflix, which is the one streaming service I and all of my friends and family reliably have in common. Until that’s added to the roster, I don’t see myself using this that often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvui2D"&gt;A new feature that I do think I’ll be using a lot is Quick Note. Quick Note gives you an easy way to take notes on an article you’re reading (or items you’re viewing in Maps, Photos, or other apps). You can right-click highlighted text to add it to a Quick Note, and it’ll appear there along with a link to the source. (You can press Fn+Q to pull up a blank one as well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On9s5f"&gt;Quick Notes sync across devices and are available in a specific “Quick Notes” folder in the Notes app. The handiest thing, I think, is that if you’ve got an app open where you’ve previously created a Quick Note, you can hover your cursor in the bottom-right corner of the screen and a thumbnail of the note will pop up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a MacBook Pro screen. The Verge’s review of the Razer Blade 14 is open in Safari. A paragraph is higlighted with “Add to Quick Note” in an adjacent drop-down menu selected. A Quick Note is open on the left side of the screen with more text and a link to the article." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/09b_x2tfr-du0C0QCPK7kHPH8mI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692276/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_4.25.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I took some notes on my recent review of the Razer Blade 14. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dIYFeJ"&gt;Apple has introduced a few “continuity” features that are meant to make it easier to use Macs alongside other Apple devices. Arguably the most exciting one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, won’t be ready until a future beta. What you can try now is AirPlay, which has made its way to macOS for the first time. AirPlay makes it easier to cast content to a Mac computer: it can mirror or extend your iPhone’s screen, for example, or can function as an AirPlay 2 speaker. I was able to set this up easily (you just need to wait until the devices detect each other and then enter a code on your phone), and it worked well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a macOS notification that reads “Airplay: Look What You Made Me Do would like to AirPlay to this Mac.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f31vkR0ekMZegf2SG1Ow2M2dQw0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692357/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_4.48.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, that is the name of my iPhone. Long story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o4V6EO"&gt;Safari has some tweaks, mainly concerning tabs. The URL bar now lives next to your tabs, which gives you more browsing space. Tabs have a rounder appearance now, and you can click one to reveal its page’s full address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdaBeU"&gt;The new feature that I think is quite useful is tab groups. The way this works is that if you have, say, five tabs open, you can click a little icon in the top-left corner to make them into a “tab group”. Later on, if you open the sidebar on the left, you’ll see the group listed in the “Tab Groups” section; click on it, and Safari will reopen those five tabs. Also in that sidebar lives a bookmarks list, a reading list, and a list of links that have been shared with you in Messages. You can test-drive the new Safari browser in older versions of macOS without having to update to the Monterey beta by installing the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/"&gt;Safari Technology Preview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Safari open on a MacBook Pro. A Verge Windows 11 video is open on YouTube. The sidebar is open showing two tab groups: Verge Videos and Verge Articles." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NwyeAMV8Q-G7S-8Q1e7rjn0-B7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692376/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_5.00.18_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tab groups are almost instant to click in and out of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7Key8M"&gt;There are a number of other odds and ends built into macOS Monterey. Shortcuts is available on macOS, Focus allows you to filter notifications based on the task you’re doing, it’s gotten easier to save photos that you receive in Messages, etc. I look forward to digging more into these features for our full review, but the things I’ve highlighted here are the ones I see being the most immediately impactful to daily use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtT8tL"&gt;The phrase “odds and ends” really sums up my impressions after using macOS Monterey for a few days. macOS Big Sur completely overhauled the Mac experience. That’s not the case here (which is fine — not every update needs to be a revolution). Apple seems to have made some tweaks here and some tweaks there. My reactions have largely been: “Alright, that could be handy.” Which is fair. I’ll take handy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjiYcv"&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523116/apple-ios-ipados-15-watchos-8-macos-monterey-wwdc-2021"&gt;list of devices&lt;/a&gt; that will support macOS Monterey: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="i7zV7I"&gt;iMac (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634"&gt;late 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DT8GDM"&gt;iMac Pro (2017 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TDG4DT"&gt;Mac Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202888"&gt;late 2013 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cZc8bq"&gt;Mac Mini (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201894"&gt;late 2014 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SkWfhc"&gt;MacBook Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201300"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FavKjr"&gt;MacBook Air (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201862"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SncFxN"&gt;MacBook (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201608"&gt;early 2016 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0hkh24"&gt;Notably, this doesn’t include a few models that did get Big Sur last year, including the 2013 MacBook Air, the late-2013 MacBook Pro, and the 2014 iMac. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the macOS Monterey public beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oICKh8FKrnULXwm4qBHN2qU3CHg=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530037/Apple_macos_monterey_shortcuts_gallery_06072021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V6zJVU"&gt;Apple has launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22321921"&gt;the public beta for macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;. This is the next big update coming to Mac computers (the final version is expected later in 2021) and it brings several big changes. In this article, we’re going to walk you through how to get the beta onto your computer, should you want it. Once you install the beta, it will likely receive several updates between now and the final release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0YsSM"&gt;(Looking for steps to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;We’ve got you covered here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VxGaqm"&gt;What’s new about macOS Monterey?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qrSMDX"&gt;One of the most impressive demos that Apple showed during WWDC 2021 was the new drag-and-drop feature called Universal Control that’ll let you seamlessly move your cursor and files between an iPad and Mac computer, as if they were all hard-wired together. Check out Dieter Bohn’s video below to find out more about that feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BzFd4h"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="The best demo at WWDC 2021|102457" data-volume-uuid="8630beec6" data-volume-id="102457" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-284" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yZtXH3"&gt;Macs will also get &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios"&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; and will be able to act as AirPlay targets, so your computer will be able to play content from your iPhone or iPad. There are more changes in the update, and my colleague Mitchell Clark &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;covers all of the highlights here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpJ1SU"&gt;Here’s some more coverage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hSuGwu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Some of macOS Monterey’s best features aren’t coming to Intel-based Macs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526224/macos-monterey-best-features-macs-intel-m1-exclusive"},{"title":"iOS 15 and macOS 12 take a small but significant step towards a password-less future","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529266/passkeys-icloud-keychain-ios-15-passwordless-future-security-login"},{"title":"macOS and tvOS are getting spatial audio support with the AirPods Pro and Max","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523914/macos-tvos-spatial-audio-support-airpods-pro-max"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="aoruii"&gt;What devices are supported for macOS Monterey?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KRiLOM"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYh6eGH4UP7Q5H8ddZjpFtunO8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693426/macos_monterey_features.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="agPCNn"&gt;How to install the macOS Monterey beta on your main partition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="21T5f4"&gt;First off, &lt;strong&gt;back up your data&lt;/strong&gt; via Time Machine. This will allow you to revert to Big Sur should things not go well with the Monterey beta. If you’re planning to install this beta on your main machine, keep in mind that you may encounter problems (bugs, incompatibility issues, worse-than-usual battery life) that might get in your way — not what you want if you’re on any kind of deadline. Also, make sure that you have around 20GB of free space available on your hard drive before trying to install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EmTzc"&gt;There’s a way to avoid some of this possible drama. If you’re using a machine with macOS High Sierra or later, you can &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208891"&gt;use built-in tools to partition your hard drive&lt;/a&gt; so the beta can live in isolation. This way, you can test out the new features, then boot into your stable macOS partition with the rest of your data when you’re done. We’ll walk through that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cnjek8"&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tusDFy"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; via Safari.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k1OEft"&gt;If you haven’t previously installed a public beta, you’ll need to sign up for access with your Apple ID. Otherwise, click “Enroll Your Devices” at the top-right corner of the webpage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xOFsNr"&gt;Click “macOS,” the middle option at the center of the next page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NcQIKX"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download the macOS Public Beta Access Utility.” Click on it to download a .DMG file, which will enroll your computer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AQuRZs"&gt;Upon booting the installer, you’ll be prompted if it doesn’t detect a Time Machine backup. (You did make a backup, right? Like I suggested above?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jIcbwa"&gt;Lastly, head to “Software Update” from the System Preferences app (if it doesn’t open automatically) to install the beta. If you’ve enrolled in the beta program, you should see the message “This Mac is enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program” located underneath the big “Software Update” icon. Note: the download might not be available to you immediately. You’ll receive a notification once it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5L1JEw"&gt;The update file will take a while to download. Once it’s done, hit install and run through the steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ksY059"&gt;How to create a separate partition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="k9dw4y"&gt;Open Disk Utility (a built-in app you can find by typing its name into the Spotlight search bar). Your hard drive’s partitions will be listed under “Internal” along the left side of the window. You might only see one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If your machine is using APFS, click the plus sign at top to create a new partition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lj2ov76oEhHDPo6067qC8ptp7Cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693724/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_12.22.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your machine is using APFS, click the plus sign at top to create a new partition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qoWZtE"&gt;If you’re using a machine with macOS High Sierra or newer, clicking your main partition should reveal that it’s a “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208891"&gt;APFS Volume&lt;/a&gt;.” If so, you can then simply click the plus button above the word “Volume” at the top-left corner of the Disk Utility window to make a new volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="751ZpM"&gt;You can name the volume anything you want, then hit “Add.” Since storage formatted to APFS is shared across volumes, there’s no need to worry about how much space to set aside in the new volume when you create it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aljRC4"&gt;(Note: If your machine’s drive is formatted to Mac OS Extended instead of APFS, you can select the “Partition” button near the top of the Disk Utility window instead. You’ll need to name the partition, then decide how much storage you’d like to have on that slice of hard drive. Given that previous public betas have been over 10GB in size, I’d suggest at least 30GB to be safe.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6sYvFc"&gt;Now that you have another volume (or partition), you can choose to install the beta to that instead of your main drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IDctbM"&gt;To switch between volumes or partitions, you’ll need to restart the machine and hold down the Option key during startup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Google’s iOS app has a secret pinball Easter egg now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7chmpE3ByTsLXOEbWNIQBeMFLkg=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528947/Google_pinball.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G8Qd91"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942"&gt;Google app on iOS&lt;/a&gt; appears to have gotten a new Easter egg: a rather entertaining little pinball app hidden away in the “Tabs” menu. The game appears to have been added a few weeks ago, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN5FFdPL7X8"&gt;several YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/o2ak9i/the_google_app_on_ios_has_this_neat_easter_egg/"&gt;a Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEYRIm"&gt;Opening the pinball game is simple: switch over to the Tabs, uh, tab in Google’s iOS app, clear out any open tabs, and then wait for the colorful shapes to start creeping up from the bottom of the screen. Swipe up on those shapes, and you’ll launch a surprisingly full-featured pinball game directly in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KFXkk6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A surprisingly good pinball game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TVeeVS"&gt;Gameplay actually works like a mix of pinball and &lt;em&gt;Brick Breaker&lt;/em&gt;, with each level spawning a variety of colorful shapes that shrink and eventually vanish with each hit. Each level adds new bumper variations and more shapes to the mix, and there are even power-ups: a heart adds an extra life, a blue star splits the pinball into two, and a yellow star makes the ball larger and easier to hit. It also works offline, in the event that you’re stuck on a plane or subway and somehow manage to only have the Google app on your phone for internet-less entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjqgNm"&gt;Is there a real purpose to the pinball Easter egg? Not really. (The same could be said of regular pinball, I suppose.) But the existential nature of pinball is beyond the scope of this blog post — besides, I need to go back and try to beat my high score. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the watchOS 8 public beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1f0JZyAt5kcMb6KUSfZfeeVP1B4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528940/vpavic_200929_4216_0128.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red color.&lt;/em&gt; | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6d4Phv"&gt;Apple has now released public betas for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey. We’ve covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;how to get the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 betas here&lt;/a&gt; — follow along below if you’re interested in testing out the latest Apple Watch software, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdurFM"&gt;WatchOS 8 is expected to get a full, stable release this fall. It brings a handful of new features, including more workout types in the Fitness app, a new Mindfulness app, a watchface that works with Portrait Mode photos taken on an iPhone, as well as improved weather and smart home apps, among other things. It’s compatible with the Series 3, Series 4, Series 5, Series 6, and SE Apple Watch models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ukj6DG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"},{"title":"How to install the macOS Monterey public beta","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Eo25aP"&gt;Before we go through how to install the beta, there are some important things you should know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="DlhMVb"&gt;Beta software is often buggy and you might have issues with third-party apps. Some bugs might include poor performance and bad battery life, an area the Apple Watch isn’t great at even with stable software. It’s best to try it out on a secondary watch if you have one (which, admittedly, most people don’t).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t4AYKj"&gt;Unlike the iOS and iPadOS betas, there’s no way to revert to the stable version of watchOS 7 if you install the watchOS 8 beta. If it’s buggy and not functioning well for you, you’re stuck with it until Apple releases the stable version in the fall. That’s probably enough of a reason to stay away from this one, particularly if you rely on your Apple Watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="EInlh9"&gt;If those don’t scare you away, here’s how to install the watchOS 8 beta on an Apple Watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Lslpir"&gt;Before you can install the watchOS 8 beta, you must have the iOS 15 beta installed on your iPhone. Go &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;follow these directions&lt;/a&gt; and come back here when you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TU9jFz"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software page&lt;/a&gt; in Safari on your iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4sTCZE"&gt;Log in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8rmJ65"&gt;Scroll down and tap the “Get Started” link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xb8SJ8"&gt;Tap the watchOS 8 tab at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3iy1P2"&gt;Select “enroll your Apple Watch” in the Get Started section of the watchOS 8 tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z0J81u"&gt;Scroll down and tap the “Download Profile” button and then select “allow” on the pop-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vNrgIX"&gt;Install the beta profile in the Watch app on your iPhone, which should automatically open once the profile is downloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qYnM9B"&gt;You will be prompted to reboot your Apple Watch. Tap the button to allow this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8lumGX"&gt;Once the Apple Watch is rebooted, go to the Watch app, tap “General,” tap “Software Update.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6n7DA9"&gt;You should see the watchOS 8 beta ready to be installed on your watch. Tap “Install” to proceed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i0EOG4"&gt;The software update will download to your phone and then transfer to the watch. To complete installation, the watch needs to be on its charger, within range of your iPhone, connected to Wi-Fi, and with 50 percent or more charge. If all of those criteria are not met, it will pause the installation until the watch is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ9wJX"&gt;Once the beta software is installed, the watch will reboot itself and you’ll be all set to use it. In our experience, some complications and third-party apps did not function until they were opened manually on the watch or the watch was rebooted a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Music Widget brings back the original Mac OS X iTunes widget </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBUOzLPYFsArf_EmTmaoJFxcNSY=/180x0:2226x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526721/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_5.35.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVvWck"&gt;Way back in 2005, Apple released Mac OS X Tiger, and with it, the original implementation of widgets on the Mac through its Dashboard software. One of those widgets was a now-defunct iTunes media player — but thanks to the efforts of programmer Mario Guzman, who’s recreated an &lt;a href="https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/#download"&gt;exact replica of the widget&lt;/a&gt; for modern Macs, you can once again enjoy your music in retro OS X style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWlpeF"&gt;Ironically, the new Music Widget isn’t actually a widget (at least, not in the current style of widgets introduced in last year’s macOS Big Sur,) but rather a standalone app that mimics the look of the original iTunes widget from 2005. The app is fully functional, offering the same controls as the original. Music Widget only works with the Apple Music app, though— Spotify (or other music apps) won’t work with the widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5UzDpD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alright nerds. I have an early beta version of my Music Widget up for download. Let me know what you think. Retweets/screenshots are welcome.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/51sfimm7LI"&gt;https://t.co/51sfimm7LI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mario Guzman  ️‍      (@MarioGuzman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarioGuzman/status/1408876166165893122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pCWRTu"&gt;Guzman’s replica also draws most of the artwork and UI elements directly in code, instead of using images, so you’re not stuck with 2005-era visuals on the widget when running on a pixel-dense Retina display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="R2X14x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Listen to Spotify on this nostalgic iPod-style web music player","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="L6rCTI"&gt;It’s not the only retro-style music player to pop up recently, either: &lt;a href="https://tannerv.com/ipod/"&gt;software developer Tanner Villarete&lt;/a&gt; created a stylistically similar web app that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;offers an iPod Classic interface&lt;/a&gt; for listening to your Spotify or Apple Music library earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcZ2uj"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/#download"&gt;Music Widget is still in beta&lt;/a&gt;, and can be downloaded for free from Guzman’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to restore your iPhone from iOS 15 beta back to iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/436VxKbwU5MbJ4reDRcGvy8orFw=/0x8:1984x1331/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526531/Apple_iPhone12Pro_iOS15_3up_060721.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15 comes with a number of new features and tweaks&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iyiSDk"&gt;Beta versions of new software are great to try out, but sometimes you realize that they’re not so good for day-to-day usage. If you’ve upgraded your iPhone to the iOS 15 beta, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;now available to the public&lt;/a&gt;, and you realize that you need to go back to the stable world of iOS 14.6, you can do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33XqPZ"&gt;The simplest way to go back to a stable version is to delete the iOS 15 beta profile and wait until the next update shows up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4WWqTe"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="54TVu0"&gt;Select “Profiles and &amp;amp; Device Management”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cRK43P"&gt;Select “Remove Profile” and restart your iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UOQ9ma"&gt;Unfortunately, you won’t be able to return to a non-beta version of iOS until a new update is available. (You can check if one is available by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Software Update.”) If you don’t want to wait, you can do a more thorough recovery — it’s more complicated, but it will get you back to where you were sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WauVpJ"&gt;The first thing you have to do is put your iPhone into Recovery Mode. This is done by connecting your iPhone to your computer (making sure it’s up to date first). I tested these instructions using a MacBook Pro, but they should work using a PC as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8garSo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aA7tkf"&gt;You then begin by doing the following (the following three bulleted directions are directly quoted from &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IXr9IH"&gt;For iPhone 8 or later: Press and quickly release the Volume Up button. Press and quickly release the Volume Down button. Then, press and hold the Side button until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J5BNNc"&gt;For iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or iPod touch (7th generation): Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Volume Down buttons at the same time. Don’t release the buttons when you see the Apple logo. Continue to hold both buttons until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zQq1vM"&gt;For iPhone 6s and earlier, iPad with Home button, or iPod touch (6th generation or earlier): Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time. Don’t release the buttons when you see the Apple logo. Continue to hold both buttons until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="57A5kp"&gt;Whichever iPhone you have, once you follow the above directions, you should see a symbol showing a cable connecting to a computer on your iPhone. Turn your attention to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Pi5yOq"&gt;There will be a notice asking if you want to update, restore, or cancel. Select “Restore.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JZEKOWpGch4GGahwRN0LFab78Qg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692236/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.25.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="4UZSYp"&gt;You’ll be asked whether you’re sure you want to restore your phone since you’re about to wipe out any personalization and go back to factory settings. Select “Restore and Update.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2R7InZ5sccPfHMZ-aIdh3y0B6WA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692200/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.29.45_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Yd7dQP"&gt;You’ll be told that you’re going to be updated to iOS 14.6 (which is the most recent version of iOS 14). Select “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K6zyi6YMqLVBuLycYtwiiGf4cO4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692209/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.30.49_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="inW1XG"&gt;At this point, you’ll be asked to agree to all of the various licensing data that you agreed to last time that you began using your iPhone. Click on “Agree.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8EazkH"&gt;You’ll then be told that your computer is downloading the software for the iPhone. It should take a while, maybe 15 minutes or so, depending on your system and your network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCF3CvoTljUMX6uPz8AtFFdMsfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692218/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.31.15_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vNZJFp"&gt;Once the OS has been downloaded, you’ll be told that it is being installed on your phone (and the phone will visibly begin uploading the software and will probably restart once or twice). When it’s done, you’ll be told via your computer screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-C3RRC8o0Cul_zf74wV-zJwICAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692231/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.40.31_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VlJLnE"&gt;Okay, now you should have restored your iPhone back to iOS 14.6. That’s all well and good, but you’ve got what is essentially a clean slate — you want to restore all your apps, personalization, and other stuff, right? This is where your backup comes in. (You &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; back up your phone before you installed the iOS 15 beta, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fGHQsR"&gt;You’ll be asked if you want to set up your iPhone using the settings from another phone. If you’ve got another with all of your settings on it, well and good — just follow the directions. But assuming that you’re going to restore from a backup, tap on “Set Up Manually.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iWdY5K"&gt;At this point, you’ll enter your Wi-Fi connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TvcyXT"&gt;You then choose how you want to restore your backup: from iCloud, from a Mac or PC, from an iPhone, or from an Android phone. You can also decide not to transfer any data at all. Let’s assume you’ve backed up to iCloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0iv157"&gt;Once you’ve made that choice, you’ll be asked to enter your Apple ID name and password and to enter a verification code sent to your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xePpsP"&gt;If you’ve made more than one backup recently, you’ll be able to choose which. (Hopefully it will not be a backup from iOS 15, which will not be transferable.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q3K0a4"&gt;Once you’ve chosen your backup, it will be transferred to your iPhone, and you should be back where you started before you installed iOS 15. You should be able to use your iPhone fairly quickly; however, it will take a few minutes before everything is uploaded from your backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="er2aC6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An intrepid YouTuber created a handheld that runs macOS Big Sur</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7EQYUaNMcI552o163fDNHO60rwY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526150/big_sur.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Iketsj/YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hcbhu"&gt;Have you ever been using a recently updated Mac computer and thought, “Man, I would love to use this operating system with a really tiny keyboard and a really tiny screen?” Okay, me neither, but I certainly would love the opportunity to carry a MacBook around in my pocket and whip it out on command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OD6MQ8"&gt;Apparently, YouTuber Ike T. Sanglay Jr., or “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS6wGHldCdaA1mtfXWHJ8yA"&gt;Iketsj,”&lt;/a&gt; has had this thought as well. In this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdsdrqA-50"&gt;eight-minute vlog&lt;/a&gt;, the YouTuber builds a tiny handheld PC that can run macOS Big Sur, and it’s very fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s7ETa"&gt;The PC includes a LattePanda Alpha SBC (single board computer) with an Intel Core m3 CPU and 8GB of RAM, as well as an Arduino Leonardo microcontroller board, a 240GB SATA SSD with the operating system preinstalled, and a 3D-printed case (of course). Watch as Sanglay winds cables, cleans screens, cuts screws, and plugs things into ports. The device comes together slowly but surely, to the tune of some serene music that’s much catchier than a YouTube background tune has any business being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibqp2v"&gt;Sanglay eventually boots the thing up, and sure enough, macOS Big Sur is there. The battery indicator doesn’t appear to be working, but the interface otherwise seems fully operational in the limited footage we see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7QsU4"&gt;Now, does this device have a real purpose in the working world? Probably not, and its creator admits as much. “Maybe you’ll say that the handheld macOS is not practical, yada yada yada. Well, sure, you’re right. I just want to make one for myself,” Sanglay notes on camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgsyoK"&gt;The YouTuber is also fully aware that the price of the parts required for this stunt comes out to more than the price of an actual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;M1 Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;. “I know, but where’s the fun in that?” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJDT8v"&gt;Still, as someone who’s long been an advocate of macOS in more creative and portable form factors, I am all in favor. While I can’t imagine actually using macOS on a screen this small, I love the idea of being able to carry its powerful functionality around in such a small package. Plus, it’s just a cute little device. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch’s Watch Parties feature is rolling out to Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PGx-W9wEOMnHE30ccmH7uaW45YU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525666/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9zopfG"&gt;Amazon-owned Twitch is rolling out its Watch Parties feature, which lets streamers host viewing parties for movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime, to Android and iOS, the company announced Wednesday. Watch Parties first launched on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418599/twitch-watch-party-rollout-global-amazon-prime-video-streaming"&gt;desktop web in September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgU6jS"&gt;While Watch Parties are a potentially fun way for Twitch streamers to hang out with their communities, there’s one important catch: only viewers who also have an Amazon Prime or Prime Video subscription &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/watch-parties?language=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Watch_Parties_M4&amp;amp;_branch_match_id=763455050422471806&amp;amp;utm_medium=Help+Page&amp;amp;utm_source=Creator+Updates#join"&gt;can join&lt;/a&gt; the party to watch what’s being shown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEzGAE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Watch Parties are now rolling out on an Android or iOS device near you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To learn more about Watch Parties, including how to host your own, check out the help article at &lt;a href="https://t.co/YvqLMCD5c6"&gt;https://t.co/YvqLMCD5c6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5aQC9It02G"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5aQC9It02G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1410285296718028803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRV4aI"&gt;But with the expansion to Android and iOS, Twitch is offering more devices from which streamers can host Watch Parties, meaning you might see more of your favorite creators using the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWnPEr"&gt;Virtual watch parties have become popular due to the pandemic, and other streaming platforms such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21492148/disney-plus-groupwatch-friends-family-us-subscribers-scener-netflix"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307519/amazon-watch-party-prime-video-virtual-parties-streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-scener-twitch"&gt;Amazon’s Prime Video&lt;/a&gt; have introduced their own watch party features. Apple’s upcoming iOS 15 update will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;add SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you watch content with other people over FaceTime — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;as long as apps support the feature, that is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP3dqaskJRC84C50bnOQSSkyrOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525171/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyU16X"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 won’t launch fully until later in 2021, but you don’t need to be a developer to test the public beta right now. If you’re willing to risk encountering possible bugs in order to try out the new features, we’re going to walk you through the steps for installing the software. It’s a similar process for iPhone and iPad, but we’ve made separate sections for each OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TncjxD"&gt;These betas will update periodically leading up to the final release. Judging from years past, that release should be around the end of the summer, close to when Apple hosts its usual autumn hardware event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFiozr"&gt;Before we get started, here’s the usual word of warning about installing unfinished beta software: these releases may seem stable for general use, but they could contain bugs that won’t be squashed until the final releases roll out later in 2021. Also, it’s possible that some of the promised features won’t be in the beta initially. Your experience may differ from others depending on the apps you use. And finally, if you do decide to install, I suggest backing up your device’s data, in case things go badly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdqQYd6S1VclYKqBImQmlJQ5trA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643660/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GE7efX"&gt;What are the new features that come with iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ajIb8j"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;new features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; include updates to FaceTime, Messages, notifications, privacy controls, and much more. FaceTime will support spatial audio and reflect the speaker’s location on-screen, with a new voice isolation ability that can remove background noise. Other changes for FaceTime include the ability to share music and videos during calls and to invite Android users to a FaceTime call with a shareable link. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;Check out Allison Johnson’s in-depth breakdown of other major updates coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MhlCIp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple adds welcome privacy features to Mail, Safari ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"},{"title":"Apple’s Live Text is going to read all the text in all your photos with AI","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="RjIx6e"&gt;What devices are supported for iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C29a2b"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4rqkT"&gt;iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4MYuU8"&gt;iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWbtK7"&gt;iPhone X, iPhone XR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gPzYC"&gt;iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xXbea7"&gt;iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CrMC2z"&gt;iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WTQtvI"&gt;iPhone SE (first and second generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jl56Ou"&gt;iPod Touch (seventh generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A0LR1r"&gt;How to install the iOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwP76L"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your phone’s Safari browser and agree to sign in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TSasnT"&gt;Select “Enroll Your Devices” within the drop-down menu at the top right of the webpage, if it automatically doesn’t route you there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pUOjHU"&gt;Select “iOS,” which is the left-most option on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to make sure that you’ve sent a backup of your phone’s content to your macOS computer, in case you need to revert to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxm87C"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then tap on it. This will bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You will get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d1bnSQ"&gt;Open the Settings app. A new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you’ll have access to the beta software download. You may need to restart your phone for the profile to activate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yJf4ys"&gt;Congrats, you did it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67NLyjVyqi1TZegsQ794RWjvKic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643196/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.49.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WEwIsU"&gt;What are the new features that come with iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Ft4C"&gt;This year’s version of iPadOS makes the homescreen more customizable, and it makes split-screen multitasking easier. The App Library feature introduced last year in iOS 14 has made its way to this new iPad software. Additionally, many of the features that Apple is bringing to iOS 15 are also coming to the tablet lineup, including more spatial audio for FaceTime, portrait mode, and SharePlay, which lets you watch TV or listen to music with others who are on the call. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;Chris Welch wrote all about the new features here&lt;/a&gt;, including a section on how iPadOS 15 “punts for another year on ‘pro’ requests,” delivering features that will appeal more generally to people instead of ones for pro-level users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pS9XwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says you can build apps on an iPad now, but devs say the reality is trickier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534902/ipad-pro-apple-swift-playgrounds-4-wwdc-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kMvcyI"&gt;What devices are supported for iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2amtEx"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gYFnXh"&gt;iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first through fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7awfUC"&gt;iPad Pro 11-inch (first through third generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nSheDn"&gt;iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q39aHn"&gt;iPad Pro 9.7-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LooIpb"&gt;iPad (fifth through eighth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0fRC4p"&gt;iPad Mini (fourth and fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gb9MY"&gt;iPad Air (second through fourth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OEDSbC"&gt;How to download the iPadOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vRB6nl"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your iPad’s Safari browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VyVf4p"&gt;Click “Enroll Your Devices” at the top of the webpage (you may need to scroll horizontally to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JizQFZ"&gt;Click “iPadOS,” which is the option that’s second from the left on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to first make a backup on your macOS computer in case you need to revert your OS to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7E9jLb"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then select it. This may bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You’ll get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vgHgoU"&gt;Open the Settings app, and a new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you should have access to the beta software download. You might need to restart your iPad first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aMnO1y"&gt;Lastly, if nothing prompts you to get started with the download, open the Settings app, head to General, then find “Software Update” to install the beta software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ndZckU4N8rhNAvTM3h79RZ4Q17Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525167/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hands-on with the public betas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RGStJw"&gt;iOS 15 and iPad 15 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;kicking off their public betas today&lt;/a&gt;, and after a few weeks with the developer betas of the new software, Apple’s OS updates feel like more of a grab bag of new features than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGHjhM"&gt;A major rethinking of either platform, this year’s updates are not. The two updates were clearly born in 2020’s norm-shattering pandemic. The feature list at WWDC and on Apple’s website wears last year’s remote-first influences firmly, from the heavy emphasis on FaceTime features to a better system for corralling notifications into “work” and “personal” buckets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCtoK8"&gt;Of course, Apple’s release cadence and insistence on major updates coming just once a year means that some of these features are arriving in what will — hopefully — be a post-pandemic return to life this fall. So it’ll be interesting to see how things like SharePlay, one of the update’s marquee features, actually shake out once people have the option to watch movies and listen to music together in person again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82OTUS"&gt;Other parts of iOS and iPadOS 15, like the overhauled Safari app or the new Maps app, feel like the kinds of more noticeable changes generally associated with Apple’s major software updates, but they’re sporadic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9D4var"&gt;The result is a software update that feels a lot quieter than Apple’s usual releases, one that — at least for now — looks to improve smaller things behind the scenes than rebuild things from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-YOwTs3Mxm7lXWTL3BFGCCtW8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689245/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iOS 15 homescreen is largely unchanged from iOS 14. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGKdwT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceTime and SharePlay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Nan3wn"&gt;The flashiest feature coming to the fall updates is SharePlay, a new Apple-wide system built on top of FaceTime for sharing TV shows, movies, music, and podcasts with friends and family even when you’re not in the same room. It’s also the most pandemic-inspired feature, an Apple product-based spin on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307583/watch-videos-movies-online-friends-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-scener-extensions"&gt;countless watch party apps and services&lt;/a&gt; that sprung up to replace movie nights over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="warmv9"&gt;SharePlay shows off how well Apple’s hardware and software services all work together: watching a TV show or listening to an album over FaceTime is seamless. But it also highlights the height of Apple’s walled garden: developers have to choose to use SharePlay — which is missing big names like Netflix and YouTube right now — and it only works on Apple hardware, despite the expansion of FaceTime and the Apple TV app to other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FEgxPx_dNvDn7GZ-gzLRUEouR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691037/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_10.11.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k8DJV1"&gt;And since content is streamed locally, everyone watching or listening has to have access to it, meaning that you can’t share an episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;with a friend who’s not a TV Plus subscriber, nor can you both watch the same movie if only one of you has purchased it from iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXcJ1T"&gt;FaceTime is also getting a wide variety of long-overdue updates that help cement it as a more viable video chatting application: a sorely needed grid view, screen sharing, a portrait mode to blur your messy background, and the ability to FaceTime with Windows and Android users (in web browsers) thanks to sharable links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGPKYn"&gt;These are all badly needed features for FaceTime, but they’re also the sort of thing that remains bewildering to have had to wait until September 2021 for, especially given the reliance on video calling over the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YfJml"&gt;Unlike SharePlay, though, the FaceTime improvements feel like the kind of thing that will remain front and center even as things start to go back to normal, although the Apple product focus and more limited feature set when compared to professional solutions like Zoom or Microsoft Teams mean that FaceTime won’t be making a play for business meetings any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tEy0Z1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZhK4nw"&gt;As is traditional for an iOS update, Apple has done some tinkering with notifications on iOS 15. Some of the smaller notifications are bigger now, and feature contact images — which might be the push to get people to actually add photos to their contacts, something that doesn’t generally exist in the real world outside of an Apple presentation in my experience. And apps that you care less about can be filtered to a new summary mode that’s delivered several times a day, instead of pinging you for each notification right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVieJE"&gt;But the bigger addition is the new Focus feature, and after only a few weeks of using it, it’s already one of my favorite features on iOS in years. On the surface, Focus is an expansion of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb feature, but instead of a blanket mute, Focus allows you to select specific apps and contacts to share notifications at specific times or specific triggers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wwnvgScnLVZ0lgi5r3_OifdHWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691389/focus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus settings (left), the expanded Do Not Disturb menu (middle), and Focus-siloed notifications (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7U7n"&gt;A “work” Focus, for example, can be set to activate when you’re on the clock and mute all notifications except from your email, Slack, and calendar apps, then automatically switch off when you’re off work. Focus modes can be triggered by specific times, locations (like when you get to your office or home from work) or when opening a specific app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="trNbrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Focus gives you real control over filtering notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRnXl4"&gt;So far, I’ve mostly just been using a “personal” focus for weekends and evenings to automatically mute any work Slacks and emails until the morning, which has been absolutely delightful. Apple’s machine learning also tries to learn from how you use your phone — for example, it suggested that I add a sports app I use a lot during “personal” time to the whitelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnjYef"&gt;And while Focus can be used in conjunction with Apple’s Screen Time feature, it’s not a totally cohesive system: for example, there’s no way to automatically disable work apps like Slack when in a “personal” Focus mode. It just shuts off notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qA9Ae"&gt;Focus also lets you assign specific homescreen pages to each Focus mode — including widgets — for even more customized experiences. iOS has also added the option to add duplicate icons for apps (so you can still have Apple Music visible on both a “personal” and a “work” homescreen, for example). But I’m a big fan of the feature, since it gives me a good reason to actually set up homescreens with widgets, and helps curb the instinct to tap the Slack icon when I’m supposed to be offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg2Joz"&gt;There’s also a new kind of notification to go with Focus and the morning summary feature, called “Time Sensitive Notifications,” which can override specific notification filtering features, so you don’t miss urgent alerts from your bank, for instance. Apple has specific rules for when developers can use these, but we’ll have to wait to see how they’re actually implemented when apps get updated this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eQJ6s9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safari explores a new look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sa-F42U9akLG4HUc8T5Q-CFoKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691391/safari.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Safari’s new design, with the rearranged URL bar.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mrCBnF"&gt;Safari has been entirely redesigned in iOS 15. In terms of material changes to iOS, this is the biggest, and it’s coming to what might be the most essential application on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP04AG"&gt;For the iPhone in particular, that means an emphasis on a one-handed design that moves the URL bar to the bottom of the screen, adds a swiping gesture interface, and a tab grouping feature (which is also coming to iPadOS and macOS Monterey). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ7LM1"&gt;I’m still getting used to it, even with a few days of use under my belt, and of all the additions in the latest software update, I suspect it’ll be the most polarizing. Over a decade of muscle memory has trained my brain to reach up for the menu bar on smartphones. I get Apple’s motivation in moving it to the bottom, making it easier to reach on the increasingly large phones it makes and putting the actual content of devices front and center at the top of the screen, it’s still a change that’ll require an adjustment period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qCUCdYYVSJw438QnZ8SDpmQE4lU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689246/cgartenberg_210629_4653_003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iPadOS 15 allows for widgets on the homescreen now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j5vaNa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad multitasking: what’s a computer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="luHkRC"&gt;Overall, iPadOS 15 gets a lot of the same improvements as the iPhone update. There’s a few iPad-specific features, though, starting with two major features from iOS 14 that were oddly missing last year: widgets on the homescreen and the App Library (which comes with a spiffy animation when you open it). I still can’t explain why Apple didn’t add those features last year, but they’re extremely welcome now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4rff1"&gt;Widgets, as expected, work even better on the iPad than they do on the iPhone, given the bigger homescreen. It’s not as big of a sacrifice to give up a quarter of your homescreen for widgets when there’s still so much extra space on the screen. Apple has also added even &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; widget sizes, the biggest size of which is roughly the same area as an entire iPhone 12 display when viewed on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Despite the massive size, Widgets still have the same functionality as they do on the iPhone, meaning that they’re focused on glanceable information rather than more interactive mini applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaF2Fz"&gt;Apple is also continuing to refine multitasking on the iPad with two new additions: a multitasking icon (three dots at the top of the display) that makes it easier to use the different split-view and slide-over modes it introduced in 2019, and a “shelf” that shows all the open windows for a particular app when you open it or tap the multitasking icon. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vQ2rbcsyuXVwyn4YZJjxh2girI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691086/IMG_0008.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking on iPadOS 15 is still... a lot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MbzDBs"&gt;The new multitasking setup is better, albeit still slightly confusing. Putting a single app into split view using the new menu punts you back to the homescreen to select a second app (or the same app again) to view in split-screen mode. Apps can be dragged and dropped when you’re in the app switching window to create new split-screen or full-screen combinations. The multitasking dots light up to show which app in split-screen is in focus, which is incrementally better than the bar from before. And swiping down on the multitasking dots is now an almost home-button-like experience, closing that app and letting you select a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ndrGX"&gt;There are still a lot of ways to move things around and arrange things and keyboard shortcuts available — so much so that Apple has a new menu when you hold the globe key to view system and multitasking shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqls37"&gt;But there’s still plenty of friction here. iPadOS remains unpredictable: I’m never 100 percent sure what version of an open app or app windows will open when I tap in on my homescreen. Just opening a new window is still an opaque process that involves dragging and dropping things around in split view. Slide-over panels still live in their own, separate confusing world. Split view is still frustratingly rigid, letting you have exactly two apps open with a third visible as a slide-over panel, instead of any other configuration (like one large app on the left and two smaller ones on the right). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8yAG2j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An iPad operating system with iPad apps — and that’s just how Apple likes it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MxrfpE"&gt;Ultimately, the new multitasking and split-screen views are a refinement of the older system, rather than some grand new paradigm for how to use an iPad. Those who like the iPad’s software abilities will likely find the new additions and enhancements to those modes nice. But those who were hoping that iPadOS 15 would offer a wildly overhauled windowing system — especially in the wake of Apple’s M1 upgrade in the latest iPad Pro — are going to be disappointed. Apple may do some additional tweaks or changes before iPadOS 15 launches this fall, but it’s unlikely to do any sweeping design changes for this update. iPadOS is still firmly an iPad operating system with iPad apps, and that seems to be how Apple likes things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3jMKY"&gt;Also new is a Samsung-like “Quick Notes” feature that lets users swipe up from the bottom corner of the display or hit a keyboard shortcut and scribble down a thought, highlight text on a website, or add a link for context. Quick Notes get saved to their own category on the Notes app, and can be accessed from other Apple devices, too. They’re useful, although like many iPadOS 15 features, it’s not something you’d likely figure out how to use without outside prompting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w8vdJA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best of the rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sRILU7"&gt;As is always the case, there are dozens of bigger and smaller features coming in iOS and iPadOS, too. Here are some of the more notable ones to check out on the public beta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKJ4ez"&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive part of the updates, letting you point your camera at any handwritten or typed text to grab a phone number or email address, translate it, or pull it directly into a text field. Apple has quietly made this a system-level feature — meaning that it’s available whenever you’re viewing an image, be it in the live camera feed, an image on the web, or directly from the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="7eJg3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cDWpCArz45zoW0gA6_K0S7khj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691400/text_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Live Text on iOS 15 can capture text directly from a photo feed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbDOvr"&gt;An interesting new addition on both operating systems is a new “Shared with You” feature, which shows photos, Apple Music songs, links, Apple TV Plus content, and podcasts that were shared over iMessage in dedicated rows within those apps. The theory is that if someone texts you a nice photo or their favorite playlist, you’ll be able to see it (and respond to it) in the Photos or Music apps. The feature is unsurprisingly entirely limited to Apple services for now, so sending a Spotify song to someone won’t appear in Spotify. It also might be overestimating how often users send links to TV Plus shows to each other, but showing shared links and photos are admittedly useful (at least, when the feature works properly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F8nIP"&gt;The Weather app has an overhauled design that adds a vertical, Dark Sky-style 10-day forecast and Dark Sky-style maps for temperature and precipitation. It looks nice. Notes and Reminders are both getting hashtags for categorizing and organizing, and the Memories feature in Photos is getting completely overhauled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHpcLX"&gt;Lastly, you can now put your Memoji avatars in outfits. I have no opinion on this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4gSsb6Ov3LMeV40ABqou9nGmF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691105/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1O7u7A"&gt;A lot of the other flashy new features are things we can’t test yet. Apple’s beta is only rolling out new maps to the San Francisco Bay Area to start (although it’ll be in far more locations when the final software is out this fall). IDs and keys in Wallet will also have to wait for broader support from state governments, hotels, and workplaces before we can see how those work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3fEA5"&gt;There are also a lot of features that will have to wait for third-party developers, like Focus statuses or SharePlay in third-party apps, which also have to wait for app updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MvxOuP"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V6Offf"&gt;The most notable thing from my time with the betas, though, is how easy it is to miss the newer features. Outside of the most in-your-face updates like the larger notifications or the new Safari design, most of the updates here are quieter, behind-the-scenes features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bVfAK1"&gt;They’re things that give you more options and ways to use your devices, but they’re just that — options. Focus modes are great for those who want to use them and integrate them into their workflow, but iOS doesn’t go out of its way to advertise them or push you to use them. It’s a mature way of looking at software, and one that’s nice to see, even if it means that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 aren’t the most exciting updates ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBtdHM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSDORv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; iOS 15 added the ability to have multiple app icons for a single app. This article originally stated that it was still not possible to do so. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
