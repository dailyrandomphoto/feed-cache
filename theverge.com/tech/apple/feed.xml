    <title>Valve releases Steam Link app for macOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NLJrr_DJytw8N7UPK-8Hibr3srM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69011317/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mN8Z0R"&gt;Valve is launching a dedicated Steam Link app for macOS this week. The app allows Steam users to stream games from a PC to devices with the Steam Link app installed. While the Steam macOS app has offered streaming already, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/steam-link-launching-on-mac/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that this lightweight Steam Link app is just 30MB in size &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/steam-link/id1246969117?l=en"&gt;from the Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt; compared to the full Steam app, which requires 1GB of storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pq9e4o"&gt;Steam Link will be useful on Macs, particularly as it’s rare to see big AAA games debut on macOS. Mac users typically have to dual boot Windows, use virtualization apps, or Steam games from a PC to get access to most of the latest titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPLbj9"&gt;Steam Link launching on macOS follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22310321/valve-steam-linux-steam-link-remote-play-together-account"&gt;Linux version of the app earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, and it now means Steam Link is available on macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi. All you need to do is download the Steam Link app, pair your device with a compatible controller, and connect to a PC over your local network to stream PC games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltkQPz"&gt;Valve also rolled out a big update to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20924545/steam-remote-play-together-beta-valve-online-co-op-local-multiplayer"&gt;Remote Play Together feature&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, allowing Steam users to stream local multiplayer games with friends over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 20-year head of developer relations retires ahead of Epic App Store trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dodo6jd71U9-4Kr_0-CM10-WKt8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69007782/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgylad"&gt;Twenty years ago, Apple CEO Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/160968/amp"&gt;poached Ron Okamoto away from Adobe&lt;/a&gt; to become vice president of developer relations and later help build the App Store. Now, we’re learning he has retired — less than a couple months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341511/apple-epic-trial-tim-cook-tim-sweeney-craig-federighi-phil-schiller-mark-rein-testify"&gt;before Apple’s App Store is set to go on trial&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DQmgd"&gt;The eagle-eyed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-s-longtime-app-store-developer-relations-chief-retires?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Mark Gurman at&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; that not only was Okamoto listed as a potential witness in that trial, but that &lt;a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20518642/2021-03-19-apple-tentative-initial-witness-list.pdf"&gt;court documents describe him&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; VP of worldwide developer relations, not the current one. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting that he’s been replaced by Susan Prescott, a product marketing exec who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8744943/apple-wwdc-2015-female-executive-on-stage"&gt;started becoming one of the public faces of the company&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MwApg"&gt;Okamoto’s still set to be deposed in the trial, but perhaps for less than an hour. He’ll seemingly be testifying about the App Store’s policies, business model, how it compares to developing for macOS, and the “transformation of the application software business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D385I6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Angry MacBook owners get class action status for butterfly keyboard suit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple has updated the options on the function row" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TcEZHNRHyTP-6dgttIU6jdb3xJE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69006345/vpavic_4291_20201113_0428.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PqEMwp"&gt;A judge has &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.326502/gov.uscourts.cand.326502.306.2.pdf"&gt;certified a class action suit&lt;/a&gt; against Apple for its fragile butterfly keyboard design. The suit covers anyone who purchased an Apple MacBook with a butterfly keyboard in seven states: California, New York, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Washington, and Michigan. That includes people who bought a MacBook model dating between 2015 and 2017, a MacBook Pro model between 2016 and 2019, or a MacBook Air between 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSU6Sr"&gt;Judge Edward Davila certified the case with seven subclasses on March 8th in California, but the order remained sealed until late last week. It raises the stakes for a suit that was first &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/05/23/second-macbook-pro-keyboard-class-action/"&gt;filed in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, three years after Apple added the controversial butterfly switches to its laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ei0D91"&gt;The butterfly keyboard was slimmer than Apple’s previous design, which used industry-standard scissor switches. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17366334/macbook-pro-keyboard-not-working-faulty-butterfly-lawsuit-wwdc-2018"&gt;many disgruntled MacBook users&lt;/a&gt; found that Apple’s revamped keyboard failed when even tiny particles of dust accumulated around the switches. That resulted in keys that felt “sticky,” failed to register keypresses, or registered multiple presses with a single hit. Apple tweaked its butterfly keyboard multiple times, but after continued complaints, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;abandoned the switches&lt;/a&gt; in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eiZilm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No matter how much lipstick you try to put on this pig ... it’s still ugly.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PistL0"&gt;This suit claims Apple knew for years that its butterfly switches were defective — and that its incremental changes weren’t fixing the core problem. It cites internal communications inside Apple, including an executive who wrote that “no matter how much lipstick you try to put on this pig [referring to the butterfly keyboard] . . . it’s still ugly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BC1CG"&gt;The plaintiffs accuse Apple of violating several laws across the seven states mentioned above, including California’s Unfair Competition Law, the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, and the Michigan Consumer Protection Act. They aren’t asking for a nationwide certification at this time, but the law firm behind the suit has invited &lt;a href="https://www.girardsharp.com/work-pending-macbook"&gt;any US buyer&lt;/a&gt; of an affected MacBook to complete a survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxH9XS"&gt;Apple argued against class action certification, saying one consolidated suit shouldn’t cover multiple tweaks to the butterfly keyboard. But the plaintiffs successfully argued that all butterfly keyboards may have the same fundamental problems due to their shallow design and narrow gaps between keys. “None of the design differences that Apple points to changed the tight spaces between the keys, nor the low-travel aspect of the design,” the order reads. Apple will have to argue later that these basic features didn’t actually make the design unreliable — and that it didn’t spend years knowingly making defective keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/spJhXlqpS2ljV6inVMR0CTAysv4=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005552/jpeters_210301_4457_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our desks can tell their own stories — and ours&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CGOpiX"&gt;Now that many of us are working from home (and it looks some will continue to do so, even after we’ve gotten past the worst of the pandemic), one of the most important places in those homes is our workspaces — in other words, our desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6iJY2"&gt;Everyone’s workspace is different. What kind of desk — and desk chair — do you use? Is your workspace neat and organized or filled with tchotchkes and toys? Do you have an old-fashioned wooden desk or a mechanized standing desk? Are you sitting on a stool or the latest Herman Miller desk chair? Is your workspace filled with this year’s high-end tech for working and gaming, or are you happy with a five-year-old laptop and a pair of headphones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EiPNnQ"&gt;In our “What’s on your desk?” series, we look into how people organize and use their workspace so that you can find out all of the various ways we see our spaces and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C33Cp8"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod mini reportedly has a secret temperature and humidity sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TD_fj5raCoRVePli0YJ9Ge0ocWo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005418/dseifert_201107_4281_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HomePod mini, released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="77cWg6"&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini smart speaker has an as-yet-undisclosed temperature and humidity sensor in its casing, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The sensor’s exact location was confirmed by iFixit, and it appears to be placed away from the speaker’s internal components so it can measure the external temperature. The exact sensor used is a 1.5 x 1.5mm HDC2010 Humidity and Temperature Digital Sensor from Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70XPfF"&gt;Although the sensor isn’t currently usable by HomePod mini owners, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;Apple has internally discussed allowing the sensor to provide information to other smart home devices like thermostats or fans. This could give smart heating equipment more information about how warm a room is or allow the speaker to trigger a device like a fan if it senses a room has reached a certain temperature. The functionality could work via HomeKit, Apple’s smart home ecosystem, which currently integrates with dozens of internet-connected thermostats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N5TJSb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The sensor may eventually be used with HomeKit devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8qi1Th"&gt;Amazon has previously included temperature sensors in Echo speakers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;its 2020 model&lt;/a&gt;, where the sensor can be used to trigger other devices via Alexa routines. Meanwhile, Google sells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17820594/nest-thermostat-remote-temperature-sensors-review-price-specs"&gt;standalone sensors via its Nest sub-brand&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Hub announced last week&lt;/a&gt; also includes a similar built-in sensor to help monitor your room’s temperature while you sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQzZm6"&gt;Although Apple declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; on its report (and did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; request for comment), on at least one occasion, it’s included hardware in a device that’s only been officially activated months later. Its 2008 iPod touch included a Bluetooth chip, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, but it wasn’t able to connect with Bluetooth devices until the year after its release. The hope is that a similar software update may be on the way for the HomePod mini. For those keeping track, major new HomePod firmware tends to release in the fall of each year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple ordered to pay $308.5 million after jury finds it infringed on  digital rights management patent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0R_xEYwzRpsShoBQaIwxoJ8GT0I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69002741/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sfBOqS"&gt;Apple has been ordered to pay $308.5 million to Personalized Media Communications after a federal jury in Texas found the company had infringed on a technology patent related to digital rights management, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/apple-told-to-pay-308-5-million-for-infringing-drm-patent?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. PMC had sued Apple over its FairPlay technology, used to distribute encrypted content from iTunes, Apple Music, and its App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlRcXH"&gt;PMC, which is a patent licensing firm, originally sued Apple in 2015, claiming the tech giant had infringed seven of its patents. Apple successfully challenged the case to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, but an appeals court reversed the patent board’s decision last March, and the case went to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnqclD"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday, but told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; it would appeal the ruling. “Cases like this, brought by companies that don’t make or sell any products, stifle innovation and ultimately harm consumers,” Apple’s statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKEr2U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-ip-idUSKBN2BC04I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Sugarland, Texas-based PMC also has infringement cases pending against Netflix, Google, and Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro looks even better than a real one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKfzK4MEgHc9NL_E6dxEaIyDTDA=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68996280/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_1.50.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="48SGu8"&gt;Intel launched a new ad campaign starring Justin Long, Apple’s “I’m a Mac” actor, but for this campaign, Long is singing the praises of PC laptops and comparing them to MacBooks. The thing is, for reasons that we can’t quite figure out, Intel actually made the MacBook Pros in its commercials look &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than they do in real life, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/my4ZjCUkTsI"&gt;tech YouTuber Rene Ritchie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHxUsS"&gt;Take a look at these two photos. The one on the left is a photo of a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip taken for &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; review. The one on the right is taken from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;this Intel ad&lt;/a&gt;. Can you spot the difference? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gCbYEy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10402291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQAO3Z"&gt;I’ll spoil it for you: Intel’s version of the MacBook Pro has &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; thinner screen bezels, making it a nearly edge-to-edge display. I’d love it if my MacBook’s bezels were this thin! (Though Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro doesn’t have a webcam. Bummer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfrVaf"&gt;But Intel’s fabled all-screen MacBook Pro didn’t make just one appearance. It’s also &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;in this ad&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to ding the MacBook Pro for not being a 2-in-1. Look at that Mac — all screen! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Umm86hxxxDCxyXPZek-082_221Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383686/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.08.32_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="deOxPX"&gt;Intel did confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Friday that it used real MacBook Pros with an M1 chip in the commercials, but the company wouldn’t initially say what it may or may not have changed about them: “With respect to filming and showcasing details, we’re not commenting at this time,” an Intel spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NmIWF"&gt;However, Intel’s Ryan Shrout confirmed a likely theory on Saturday: Intel changed the look of the MacBook Pros’ screens in post-production, which had the happenstance effect of making their screens look better than they do in real life. It was a rush job, apparently, and they made a mistake when compositing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ZhPwq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Also, the composite on the Macs made the bezels look smaller than they should be, another mistake in composite due to time.

&lt;p id="e0FVO2"&gt;(If you look at the image from the second ad, you can also see some kind of blackish-haze applied over the screen, which probably wouldn’t be there in reality.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Q96gD"&gt;These ads, in my opinion, are also kind of missing the point. None of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;Intel’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfHplU5fatE"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HebkohrCns"&gt;commercials&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate how Intel’s chips can compete with the MacBook Pro’s real advantage: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s speedy and battery-efficient M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;. (So far, Intel has only produced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272041/intel-apple-macbook-m1-performance-benchmarks-processors"&gt;cherry-picked benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; to try and hit back at the M1.) And by trying to dunk on the MacBook Pro, Intel is also, in a way, dunking on itself, since it still provides chips for some models of the Apple laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1k50q1"&gt;And seriously, doesn’t that all-screen MacBook Pro just look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnauH2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 20th, 9PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Intel’s confirmation that it was a compositing error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IsIoq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Shrout tweeted on Saturday, not Sunday, because it is not Sunday yet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22340964/twitter-accounts-bots-days-of-the-week-what-day-is-it"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I blame Daniel Craig.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brazil regulator fines Apple $2 million for not including chargers with iPhone 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The dual camera system on the iPhone 12." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgZL-7aIOLb2ZnWU4HIhu4bDJEc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999752/vpavic_4243_20201018_0139.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9RLt8N"&gt;The consumer protection agency in Brazil’s São Paulo state has fined Apple $2 million for failing to include chargers within iPhone 12 boxes, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/20/brazil-agency-fines-apple-iphone-12-charger/"&gt;according to&lt;em&gt; 9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Procon-SP says Apple engaged in “misleading advertising, selling a device without the charger and unfair terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhGqAY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple announced in October&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 12 and would not come with chargers or earbuds in their boxes, citing environmental concerns. By only including a USB-C to Lightning cable with iPhone 12 and other new models, Apple said it would be able to reduce the raw materials for each iPhone it sells, in addition to reducing the size of the phones’ boxes. Critics suggested the change had more to do with allowing Apple to reduce shipping costs, and environmental experts said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;impact on the environment would likely be minimal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5YEJv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/procon-na-midia/"&gt;Procon&lt;/a&gt; said it asked Apple whether the company would reduce the iPhone 12’s price since there were no chargers included, and did not receive a response. The agency also accused the company of failing to help customers who had “problems with some functions” on their iPhones following updates. A spokesman for the agency said Apple “needs to respect these laws and these institutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL1kTN"&gt;The fine does not seem like it would be particularly troubling for Apple, which had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;$111.4 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt; in the first quarter of 2021 (that total includes 2020 holiday sales of iPhone 12 models). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mw50E"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple discontinuing two configurations of its 21.5 inch iMac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUWgd5-YJjYedvU_sL9yJ_k_sj8=/48x0:2808x1840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999258/Screen_Shot_2020_08_04_at_11.10.17_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The 21.5 and 27 inch iMacs | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fGSntk"&gt;Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316831/apple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last"&gt;discontinued the iMac Pro,&lt;/a&gt; and two configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are now joining the Pro in retirement. As spotted &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/20/512gb-1tb-ssd-imac-21-discontinued/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 512GB and 1TB SSD configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are no longer available for purchase, with only the 256GB SSD and 1TB Fusion drive versions available to buy on Apple’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlNXBM"&gt;Both configurations appeared &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/21-5-inch-imac-ssd-upgrades-unavailable/"&gt;unavailable for purchase&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s website as of last month, but at the time it was not clear if that was a supply issue or a permanent discontinuation of the two options. But now both the 512GB and 1TB SSD options are gone from the iMac configuration page, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugEhbO"&gt;A big iMac redesign has been rumored in the works for some time. Apple is expected to replace the 27-inch and 21.5-inch versions of the iMac with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt; and will likely revamp the Mac Pro sometime this year. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the update would have a flat-back design and do away with the “chin” beneath the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuOIe5"&gt;The new iMacs are expected to use Apple silicon chips, as the company continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;shift away from Intel chips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Epic’s top execs plan to testify live and in person this May in the Fortnite app store trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DoaZxlVhtkPmXdYhPqG3_Ctapcc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68997766/VRG_TBP_Epic_VS_Apple_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkZunV"&gt;It’s hard to believe it’s only been seven months since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368504/fortnite-apple-google-app-store-brief-incomplete-timeline"&gt;Apple booted &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;Epic Games sprung its antitrust trap&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t have to wait much longer before the behind-the-scenes legal machinations give way to courtroom drama — and, it seems, until Apple and Epic’s top executives take the stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HH4vgl"&gt;In a legal filing Friday evening, Apple revealed that CEO Tim Cook, SVP Craig Federighi, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354367/apple-phil-schiller-fellow-greg-joswiak-head-marketing-store-events"&gt;former marketing chief and current App Store boss Phil Schiller&lt;/a&gt; intend to testify live and in person in the courtroom, among many other tentative witnesses. Epic Games’ CEO Tim Sweeney and VP Mark Rein should be there as well, plus Facebook’s VP of gaming, a Microsoft VP of Xbox business development, and quite a number of directors on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEs5de"&gt;Schiller is expected to spend the most time on the witness stand by far at an estimated 11 hours of examination and cross-examination, which makes sense. Not only has he been in charge of the App Store that’s at the center of the case, but some of his emails and the emails of his subordinates have been under scrutiny — both for this case and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;in the big tech antitrust hearing last year&lt;/a&gt;, one which ended with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504814/congress-antitrust-report-house-judiciary-committee-apple-google-amazon-facebook"&gt;the House Judiciary Committee concluding that&lt;/a&gt; “Apple exerts monopoly power in the mobile app store market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2avXFS"&gt;Apple says its executives “look forward to sharing with the court”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UZEeRl"&gt;Our senior executives look forward to sharing with the court the very positive impact the App Store has had on innovation, economies across the world and the customer experience over the last 12 years. We feel confident the case will prove that Epic purposefully breached its agreement solely to increase its revenues, which is what resulted in their removal from the App Store. By doing that, Epic circumvented the security features of the App Store in a way that would lead to reduced competition and put consumers’ privacy and data security at tremendous risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wNRhb7"&gt;The trial &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.116.0.pdf"&gt;should tentatively begin May 3rd&lt;/a&gt;, and is expected to run several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGZBUm"&gt;You can find the full list of tentative witnesses and those who’ll be tentatively deposed below.&lt;/p&gt;
