    <title>Wipeout gets ‘reimagined’ as a mobile game where you manage instead of drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Wipeout Rush" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wAYiRItfE5je3fDHFY-ogAwGD4w=/0x0:1942x1295/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866650/wipeoutrush.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="or3y46"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, the fast-paced, futuristic racing series that’s synonymous with PlayStation, is coming to iOS and Android mobile devices later in 2021. The new game is called &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt;, and unfortunately, it might not be what you’re after if you’ve adored previous entries in the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI50dq"&gt;The game, developed by Rogue, is a card-based racing game that doesn’t actually put you in the driver's seat. Instead, you’ll be the team manager of racers who will get to do all of the fun driving while you’re dealing with cards. The game promises to dive into the lore of &lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m most looking forward to finding out why the player can’t drive. Did they lose their license?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pymiAg"&gt;Here’s a description of &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://rogueco.com/portfolio-item/wipeout-rush/"&gt;as noted on Rogue’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4Q0mTJ"&gt;For fans of the series, &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt; is bringing loads of new lore through collectables and story. Players will be able to unlock collectable cards to learn more about the ships, teams, pilots, and tracks of the Wipeout world as they progress through an engaging single-player campaign told through exciting animated comics. &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt; will include both Quick Race and Championship Cup game modes complete with 5 different tracks, 60 iconic Wipeout ships, a wide range of familiar weapons, 12 Championship Cups each with their own boss, and bundles of collectables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BX0rfV"&gt;For a second there, I imagined how great a &lt;em&gt;Wipeout &lt;/em&gt;game for phones could look and play, especially now that there are several phones with fast refresh rate displays (the iPhone 13 Pro is the most notable addition to that group recently), as well as solid mobile controllers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RonRWE"&gt;I’m willing to give this game a shot when it comes out, and it could be fun in its own way, but it’s been a while since I’ve so quickly gone from being excited about something to just being a little sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHi11c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXLIvJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Razer Blade 15 Advanced is $800 off at Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BsokZvUTTCHeE2I1wKHFwtGFsSg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866628/cfaulkner_200929_4214_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBksi0"&gt;Gaming laptops are by no means cheap, but today you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086M8PQYR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $800 on the Razer Blade 15 Advanced at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This laptop was built expressly for the purpose of delivering desktop gaming performance in a laptop form factor. Packing an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q graphics card and a 10875H Intel processor capable of topping out at 5.0GHz, the Razer Blade 15 does exactly that. The FHD display has a 300Hz refresh rate, better than you’d see on most desktop gaming monitors, allowing for sharp reaction times and virtually no lag, letting you get the drop on your enemy. A 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of RAM round out the laptop’s specs, offering you plenty of onboard storage and speed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Razer Blade 15 Advanced review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="brF3EP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming laptops you can buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="KJaYDv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y47mjC"&gt;Ahead of the new 2021 base iPad releasing next Friday, September 24th, you can save $30 on a preorder through Walmart. Normally $329 for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;the 64GB Wi-Fi model that Apple just introduced&lt;/a&gt; at its “California Streaming” event, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1133983/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F483978365&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A6890999&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=6890999" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $299&lt;/a&gt;. So, get it for this price while you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwoqO3"&gt;This model features a slate of improvements over the previous generation, including the bump up to 64GB of storage, the faster A13 Bionic processor, and True Tone screen tech that lets the screen match the color temperature in your room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ObZyjs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cbGCeh"&gt;If you’re a streamer in the market for a new microphone, look no further than the Razer Seiren Emote, now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XB39R7B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This slick hyper-cardioid condenser microphone bears a striking resemblance to the other entries in the Seiren family, until it connects with Razer’s streamer companion app. The front of the mic contains an 8-bit LED display, capable of showing hundreds of customizable emotes that react to your chat. While this mic certainly isn’t for everyone, you’ll have a hard time finding a microphone more unique or better suited to connecting with your audience during a stream. Amazon notes that only a few units are left in stock, so hopefully it replenishes throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w0ml3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gj9UpW"&gt;Anyone looking for a midsize 4K TV should definitely check out this deal at Best Buy. This 50-inch model from Sony is still &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAEDde5Aev#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Best Buy for $700&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date. In addition to offering crisp 4K resolution, the X80J touts several features that elevate the viewing experience. HDR10 and Dolby Vision certification provide deeper blacks and more vivid colors, while built-in voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant allow you to easily search and swap channels. The TV includes built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, too, which help cut down on cord clutter, and the X80J can be wall-mounted with any 200 x 200 VESA mount. The TV can also handle up to four HDMI devices and offers an audio return channel in case you want to route your devices through a soundbar or receiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nHPwZ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754734"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gReWX9"&gt;One of the lightest wireless mice in Razer’s arsenal is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Hyperspeed-Lightest-Wireless/dp/B07YPC3BQC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for just $120 today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from its normal retail price of $150. The Viper has been a mainstay of the Razer armory for some time, but this wireless version brings some solid improvements to the tested design. The Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed weighs a paltry 74 grams and packs a powerful 20K DPI optical sensor. The ambidextrous design also sports six remappable buttons, making it one of the best mice available for southpaw shooters. The most noticeable improvement, however, is the inclusion of wireless connectivity. It can be paired either via Bluetooth or to the included 2.4GHz dongle, and the Viper Ultimate is said to last up to 70 hours on a single charge and can be recharged either via Micro USB or with the included recharging dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="udUahX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754700"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V7YzIa"&gt;A pair of earbuds that no Apple aficionado should be without, the Beats Powerbeats Pro, are &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1151608/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fpowerbeats-pro-wireless-earphones%2F-%2FA-78362035" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Target for $175 in red&lt;/a&gt;. These water-resistant earbuds can handle even the sweatiest workouts, and the adjustable ear hooks ensure they won’t jostle loose during a run. The earbuds can last for up to nine hours on a single charge but can stretch to 24 hours if the case is topped off. While the earbuds definitely work best with Apple devices thanks to their built-in H1 chip — a piece of hardware allows for always-on Siri detection and better call quality in windy environments, among other improvements — they can be used with a wide variety of Bluetooth-enabled devices. Just note that the charging case can only connect using an Apple lightning cable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WGWd5F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9EzqOl"&gt;A solid addition to any Xbox or PC gaming setup, the HyperX CloudX Flight Wireless is currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAVP3dG6gn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fkingston-hyperx-cloudx-flight-wireless-gaming-headset%2F93G680VL1NKH%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; for $120, its second-best price to date. HyperX is known for its comfortable and functional gaming headsets. It may lack some of the outward flair of its competitors, but the CloudX can still trade blows with competing headsets that are nearly double the price. The CloudX Flight comes with a detachable boom mic, leatherette ear cups, and boasts a battery life of up to 30 hours. While the CloudX has been designed for the Xbox family of consoles, it can still connect to PCs thanks to its 2.4GHz wireless dongle. It even comes with a built-in chat mixer, so you can adjust your audio levels without combing through in-game menus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make iPhone 13 preorders a one-step process on Friday by following these steps  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_vNfkWDiabkczCTpDc4TicD6fM=/277x0:1456x786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866078/image__4_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process lets you make your selection ahead of preorders opening.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Apple.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bQuvga"&gt;If you’re planning on preordering one of Apple’s new iPhone 13 models at 8AM ET on Friday, September 17th, you might be interested to know that &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-offers-more-ways-to-shop-for-the-iphone-13-lineup-ipad-and-ipad-mini/"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; customers can pre-register their details to make the checkout process a little easier. Now, before you say anything, I completely agree that the idea of &lt;em&gt;pre-registering &lt;/em&gt;for a &lt;em&gt;preorder&lt;/em&gt; sounds ridiculous. But if you’re someone who wants to complete the preorder as quickly as possible to guarantee an early ship date during a time of global component shortages, it’s a useful trick to know. Just be aware that this process is only available until midnight on Thursday, Eastern Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xuY6R"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/iphone-upgrade-program-iphone-12/?Bibblio_source=true"&gt;isn’t the first time Apple has offered pre-registration&lt;/a&gt;. But previously this route appears to have been reserved for customers on the iPhone Upgrade Program, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-pre-orders-get-ready/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, a 24-month payment plan that includes AppleCare Plus and offers a phone upgrade each year. But now anyone can enter their details early to buy a phone with far less hassle on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU0o9c"&gt;To pre-register, head over to the Apple Store app or &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone"&gt;Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt; to get started. Anyone on the upgrade plan will have their upgrade eligibility checked and credit lines approved. Other customers can pick out their preferred iPhone model, register their carrier status, enter payment details, and pick out accessories and / or an AppleCare Plus plan. Just be aware that some users are reporting seeing a “Your iPhone pre-order has expired” error message, which &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/expired-phone-13-pre-order-message-glitch/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Xkgk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 16th, 9:35AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added link to Apple’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-offers-more-ways-to-shop-for-the-iphone-13-lineup-ipad-and-ipad-mini/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;press release&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple rumors were wrong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKHVS98oRvLVujwbE22WM_qpH0E=/243x0:2637x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864614/Screen_Shot_2021_09_15_at_1.34.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: Tim Cook, knowing he’s not about to announce the thing I want.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4822ua"&gt;For many who follow tech news closely, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; had a few big surprises — not because there were completely unexpected announcements, but because we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;didn’t see things we really thought we’d be getting&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors that had enough smoke to be almost a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21508779/apple-iphone-12-october-event-what-to-expect-hi-speed-rumors"&gt;sure-fire thing in previous years&lt;/a&gt; ended up falling flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpQrSZ"&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knom6u"&gt;The Apple Watch was rumored to get a complete redesign, featuring flat edges and a flat screen. We saw this design in renders, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/"&gt;reportedly leaked CAD files&lt;/a&gt; (which act as a 3D blueprint for products), and even heard that it’d be happening from noted Apple reporter Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-12/what-s-new-about-apple-aapl-iphone-13-and-apple-watch-series-7?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;two days before the event&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;the Apple Watch that showed up on stage&lt;/a&gt; does have some design tweaks, it looks nothing like what we were expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N1vUzoxNV7Zba4LIgjYD0Afx0nc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850146/Capto_Capture_2021_09_14_01_24_25_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series 7 has a refined version of the same design we’ve had for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scaNm7"&gt;Another notable analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, also &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/12/kuo-airpods-3-to-be-announced-at-september-event-airpods-2-to-remain-in-the-lineup/"&gt;reported days before the event&lt;/a&gt; that Apple would debut a new set of AirPods, redesigned to include shorter stems. The wireless earbud redesign has also been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-26/apple-developing-smaller-airpods-pro-revamped-entry-level-model?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;rumored for months&lt;/a&gt; by Gurman, we’ve even &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/"&gt;seen alleged pictures of them&lt;/a&gt;, and some noted publications wrote that Apple was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;set to start production on the buds in August&lt;/a&gt;. With this rumor, though, it’s possible that just the timing was off, and that Apple will release them at an (of course!) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1437140403803672581"&gt;already-rumored future event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mddFlo"&gt;Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/18/iphone-13-always-on-display/"&gt;also suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 13 could feature an always-on display, thanks to the (accurately rumored) LTPO display that could theoretically allow for the low refresh rate needed to make always-on not destroy the phone’s battery. The always-on rumor was also &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/14/iphone-13-always-on-display-matte-back/"&gt;backed up by well-known leaker&lt;/a&gt; Max Weinbach earlier this year. Alas, Apple didn’t announce this display feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672551/iphone-13-display-lock-screen-always-on-variable-refresh-android"&gt;has been a staple on Android phones&lt;/a&gt; for years.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro has a display that could enable always-on, but the feature is absent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IEO7Ea"&gt;There was also just some general weirdness with rumors this time around. Only a few weeks before the iPhone 13 was announced, Kuo wrote that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647252/the-iphone-13-5g-leo-satellite"&gt;it might have the ability to communicate with satellites&lt;/a&gt;, letting you make calls or texts without cell service. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22649340/apple-iphone-13-satellite-connectivity-emergency"&gt;The next day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; offered its own interpretation, saying that Apple was working on a satellite communications feature for emergency use, and that the iPhone 13 may include hardware for it, but probably not software. However, when the iPhone 13 spec page hit Apple’s website, it &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/that-whole-iphone-satellite-thing-was-bogus"&gt;didn’t include any mention&lt;/a&gt; of the cellular bands that started the starry-eyed rumors in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e9w6RR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rumors have always needed a grain of salt, but this year seemed to have some big misses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SHA3DM"&gt;Of course, rumors have always had to be taken with a grain of salt, as anyone trading in them is almost certainly going to be working with incomplete information. Still, some of the big names like Kuo and Gurman get it right so often — the rumors about the iPad Mini redesign, high refresh-rate iPhone display, and smaller notch all came true, and we even saw the rumored cinematic camera mode. Success like that, and how accurate rumors have been in years past, can make it easier to forget the tenuousness of rumors — no matter how many times &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1429768663658377218"&gt;people like Marques Brownlee remind us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Na5eAM"&gt;This isn’t to laugh at those who believed the rumors, or say that there’s no place for rumors in the buildup to events — it can be exciting to feel like we’re getting a peek at what’s coming next, and to start thinking about whether we’ll pick up the new device, and how we’ll use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUvsSK"&gt;P.S. Remember this moment if Apple announces something that looks suspiciously like a Mac event later this fall. This isn’t to say that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;14- and 16-inch redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; with all the ports and processing power you ever wanted &lt;em&gt;aren’t &lt;/em&gt;coming, but treating them as a sure thing could lead to some real heartache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7YkH6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 event was a case study in Tim Cook-era product refinement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nY-wgBmscZppIFjXnbt-lR0xykI=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864483/caZMw9TLgc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L12bxo"&gt;For the past ten years, Tim Cook’s greatest accomplishment as Apple CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;has been vastly more of the same&lt;/a&gt;. More iPhones, more iPhone accessories, more apps, and &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; more money. While the Mac and iPad have occasionally fallen into disrepair, the company keeps coming back with new reasons to buy its greatest hits every year — and this year’s iPhone 13 event is a near-perfect case study in how far refinement can take you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfHWL7"&gt;As my colleague Jon Porter points out, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675797/iphone-13-12s-upgrade-cycle-iterative-improvements"&gt;the iPhone 13 is effectively the iPhone 12S&lt;/a&gt;, an iterative, incremental update to last year’s phones instead of something that feels brand new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dXLvBc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tim Cook’s Apple, ten years later","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fZSCix"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost everything got better&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9rX6ak"&gt;But oh, what an update. What company wouldn’t dream of being able to say they improved the processing power AND the battery life AND the cameras AND the displays AND the storage capacity AND the connectivity AND the design in the course of a single year, all without changing the price one bit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wS1uT"&gt;In 2021, the same $829 you’d pay last year now buys you &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; the storage, a whopping 2.5 additional hours of quoted battery life, more 5G bands, and an additional 175 nits of brightness over the iPhone 12, plus the 47 percent larger sensor and sensor-shift stabilization system that was previously exclusively available in the $1,099-and-up iPhone 12 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673545/iphone-13-pro-camera-cinematic-mode-video-features-macro"&gt;A new cinematic video mode&lt;/a&gt; isn’t exclusive to the Pros, either (though smooth 120Hz screens, a new macro photography mode and ProRes video will be.) And while the company doesn’t offer any real numbers to back it up, Apple claims even the iPhone 13 Mini will give you the fastest processor available in any smartphone on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FppkXh5u16t5F49SXpgCmjY-yaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853924/aCizUZJtka.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini bento box of upgrades. Notch at lower left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mg0Hef"&gt;Also, you can’t say the design didn’t change at all. While&lt;em&gt; the notch &lt;/em&gt;still exists, it’s smaller! (I like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;the iPhone 13 Pro’s blue&lt;/a&gt; an awful lot, too.) The only tradeoff I can find this year — ahead of our reviews, that is — is that the iPhone 13 lineup is oh-so-slightly thicker and heavier. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;You can find our comparison charts here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kd0ptM"&gt;This year’s iteration is so compelling that I’m vaguely tempted to upgrade my perfectly good iPhone 12 Mini to get that better camera with sensor-shift and an additional hour or so of battery life. (I probably won’t, since the announcement means the resale value of my existing phone has likely already tanked, but I do worry Apple might still cut off the Mini next year due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;reportedly lackluster sales&lt;/a&gt;.) If I had an iPhone 11 or earlier, it’d be a no brainer — I’d definitely be preordering one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bJplwW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says it every year, but the iPhone 13 cameras do seem much improved","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675127/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-camera-analysis-specs"},{"title":"Goodbye and good riddance to Apple’s 64GB iPhones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22675300/apple-64gb-iphone-13-128gb-standard-storage-space-photos-videos-apps"},{"title":"The iPhone 13 is a pitch-perfect iPhone 12S","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675797/iphone-13-12s-upgrade-cycle-iterative-improvements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BqqQKq"&gt;And while it might feel criminal that the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;$329 10.2-inch iPad&lt;/a&gt; still uses a Lightning connector and first-gen Apple Pencil, Apple’s still issuing a decent upgrade there without asking for more money — doubling the base storage from 32GB to 64GB, moving from the A10 Fusion chip to A13 Bionic, and hopefully finally putting a decent front-facing camera (12MP, vs. just 1.2MP!) onto its entry-level tablet computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kR-Dwve4mGztbuaSeoftPRaRGec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853917/uJGfKlMU0L.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u12G4J"&gt;The story’s a little bit different with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;the 6th-gen iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, mind, since it starts $100 higher than before at $499. But the upgrade incentives are still strong: it’s a crystal-clear update over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;its predecessor&lt;/a&gt; with a larger and higher resolution 8.3-inch screen despite its slightly smaller and lighter frame, with a magnetic connector to dock a 2nd-gen Apple Pencil. It’s got the A15 Bionic chip from the new iPhone 13, but with the extra graphics core you’ll only otherwise fined on the iPhone 13 Pro. The camera’s bigger and faster at 12MP and f/1.8 (compared to 8MP and f/2.4), with 4K video for the first time, and both the Wi-Fi 6 and 5G support that the 2019 model lacked. Just don’t go looking for a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMqdPy"&gt;Apple is managing all of this during a pandemic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;a global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, and so far there’s only been a single indication that Tim Cook’s giant manufacturing machine can’t keep up: The new Apple Watch Series 7 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;rumored to be delayed due to production issues&lt;/a&gt;, and while it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666305/apple-series-7-manufacturing-issues-resolved-september-mass-production"&gt;reportedly overcame them&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t have any release date for the new watch save “later this fall” and Apple’s being cagey about the details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2wfR6eU2cufFTX1Lpx7Ey-y5uA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853915/BCslcISSRg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XWhnSI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1nc9br15gf0scjb/Apple%20Watch%E2%80%94Then%20and%20Now%20%28Sept%202020%29_L568943A-en_US.pdf?dl=0"&gt;A leaked spec sheet for the watch&lt;/a&gt; suggests it was supposed to ship in September alongside the new phones, but the fine print says even its specs are “subject to change without notice,” and Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment about the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlMIUA"&gt;The watch is why I say this year’s event is a &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; perfect case study: it’s not as clear why someone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"&gt;would buy the Series 7 over a discounted Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, despite the larger and reportedly more durable screen. With the same battery life and no reason to believe there’s more processing power or functionality, plus a late start, it might be the one insufficient iteration this year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD4RpU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vy3kpO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPads are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable — now outgoing — entry-level iPad from last year, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of sale happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s often what deal our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each iPads model that is currently available, some of which are also available &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished&lt;/a&gt;. You should also be aware that &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop%2Fback-to-school&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is currently running its back-to-school promotion&lt;/a&gt; until September 27th, meaning you can snag a free set of AirPods with the purchase of either an iPad Air or iPad Pro. If you prefer the AirPods Pro, you can also upgrade for an additional $90. Either way, you have to be a student who’s eligible to check out through Apple’s educational storefront. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;2020 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s most affordable tablet, however, it’s now being replaced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;9th Gen model announced&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;Apple’s recent iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re in the market for the new model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"&gt;preorders are available now&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments slated for Friday, September 24th. As you might expect, there are no discounts currently available on the 2021 model, given the tablet has yet to hit store shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;If you want to try getting the best possible price on last year’s model, though, know that the 32GB model initially retailed for $329 and the 128GB variant for $429. The new, 64GB model goes for the same price as last year’s 32GB variant ($329), while the 256GB configuration jumps to $479. The 2020 model has the same 10.2-inch display and features the older A12 Bionic processor, a front-facing Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the physical home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9iBwQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431710"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, the outgoing base model iPad is a bit hard to come by at many retailers. It is either out of stock or marked as discontinued at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5J9699?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-10-2-inch-wi-fi-only-8th-generation%2F-%2FA-81498539%3Fpreselect%3D80596591%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1751882593844829755#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594504-REG%2Fapple_myl92ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_32gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, Apple only offers a refurbished one with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFW782LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-IPAD-WI-FI-128GB-Silver%3Ffnode%3Df7a6c58dde7329b21579b02c65a17e1f89102b3746bf56fb4fc1e60dbff56530c0f1da3d19e86a9a6f6e6858f96394b5d01117d34b59a73cdea074885f80ed0867aa9a4cdbdcf73ca96c7f42bd02edf1&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage and Wi-Fi for $279&lt;/a&gt;, though the new ninth-generation model might be a more compelling proposition if you prefer the benefits of the faster A13 Bionic processor and 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. That said, we’ll keep an eye out for any sale opportunities before the 2020 iPads are completely gone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019 with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. Just like the base iPad, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new iPad Mini was announced&lt;/a&gt; during Apple’s “California Streaming” event. While the upcoming, revamped Mini looks promising with its larger screen, top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and 5G option, it also starts at a higher price point of $599. The current iPad Mini has the A12 Bionic processor and normally runs $399 for 64GB of storage and $549 for 256GB. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $529 for the 64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model of the 2019 iPad Mini don’t always come around, though we have seen some recently. The 64GB, Wi-Fi-enabled iPad Mini is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available right now for $299 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in space gray and gold. Amazon does not currently have any 64GB models in stock, but is offering the 256GB unit &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $449&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-256GB%2F211304805%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart offers all three colors of the expanded storage option for the same price&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skoMEh"&gt;Just like the base iPad, the replacement model looks enticing — and if you’re interested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can preorder it now&lt;/a&gt; — though there will certainly be a bigger price delta with the increased starting price of the new iPad Mini and the fact that its predecessor is sure to continue receiving discounts. Also, as of right now, the 2021 model is not available at a discount, which is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $500 — $100 off the list price — in all of its vibrant colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB, Wi-Fi-enabled version is available for a $100 discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, with your choice of most colors marked down to $650. The one outlier is the green model, which has a more modestly discounted price of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Green%2F705887437%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$720&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tNTIrn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple is releasing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 on September 20th","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in some configurations at Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB base storage is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1148110/2092?subId1=VergeiPadDeals080321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-silver%2F-%2FA-77616876" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $700 at Target&lt;/a&gt; — though you may have to pick it up at a brick-and-mortar location near you. The 256GB model is available for $769 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553812-REG%2Fapple_mxdc2ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $800 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; in space gray. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $950 and $1,150, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo. If you prefer Wi-Fi only, the 128GB model is discounted to $849 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553840-REG%2Fapple_my2h2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB model is $929 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $1,000 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748082168808445595#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the 512GB model is $1,150 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; while the massive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; is $1,350&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-generation model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

That shaves $100 off the cost of either of those massive storage options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;The desirable Mini LED-equipped 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $999, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date.

    <title>How to wipe your iPhone before selling it or trading it in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRZDDxjgCrH3NcjNp8c-HipaLj0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863370/jbareham_171031_2099_A_0227.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVRqDL"&gt;Whether you’re trading in your old iPhone for a discount on a new one, selling it, giving it away, or recycling it, you’re going to want to erase all of your data first. Not only do you want to keep personal information from falling into the wrong hands, but let’s face it: nobody’s going to want a phone with your old selfies on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTTd2a"&gt;After you’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671906/iphone-date-transfer-ios-icloud-upgrade"&gt;transferred all of your data to a new phone&lt;/a&gt; (or, if you’re not getting a new phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22673693/iphone-apple-backup-ios-icloud"&gt;backed your data up&lt;/a&gt;), here’s how to wipe your iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KJzHI1"&gt;Get rid of a few identifiable features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uUBuwb"&gt;Disable “Find My iPhone” by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Find My” &amp;gt; “Find My Phone” and toggling “Find My Phone” and “Find My Network” to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DQ6OXX"&gt;Unpair any devices from your phone, including your Apple Watch. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SMREGp"&gt;Toggle iMessages off (just in case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g1y20x"&gt;Sign out of your Apple ID&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t9tT4x"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “Sign Out” (at the bottom of the page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LaxEWl"&gt;Enter your Apple ID password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xmVLyK"&gt;You’ll be asked if you want to keep a copy of your data on this iPhone. Assuming you’ve backed everything up and are about to wipe your phone, you don’t need to toggle anything on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xZdkhV"&gt;Tap on “Sign Out” in the upper-right corner and then again on the “Are you sure?” pop-up window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1ucZCq"&gt;Get ready to erase it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHqjWX"&gt;Remove the SIM card from the phone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72iH92"&gt;Go into “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Transfer or Reset iPhone” and select “Erase All Content and Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you’re wiping your phone, you don’t want to keep any data on it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/piUZnlaqfVeSDb64HBCoO6H3iqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838056/IMG_C0157C8B9455_1.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Apple’s tvOS 15 update arrives September 20th sans SharePlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wivW8lRbosMS8MKNLw1kM7BTwOg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863338/DSCF3875_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2DXjp"&gt;The refreshed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; hit shelves in April, but the anticipated tvOS 15 update that introduces exciting updates to the Apple TV experience was previously only available in beta. That will change next week: Apple has confirmed tvOS 15 will become widely available to everyone on September 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkRNFp"&gt;Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the tvOS 15 update will go live the same day as its other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;operating system updates&lt;/a&gt;, which include iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The tvOS 15 update brings a number of new features to the Apple TV experience. SharePlay is arguably the most exciting addition to the experience and will allow FaceTime users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;stream titles together&lt;/a&gt; in sync across their Apple devices, including on Apple TV. However, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;confirmed in August&lt;/a&gt; that the feature would be delayed on iOS 15 and tvOS 15 initially and would arrive in a later update, so that feature’s currently still on ice — for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xszn4z"&gt;tvOS will also add two new discovery features to its Apple TV app: For All of You and Shared with You. For All of You will appear as a new row in the Apple TV app and will suggest titles for an entire household to stream together. Shared with You, meanwhile, will show movies and series that have been shared from Messages in their own row within the Apple TV app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rMl7tB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New discovery features and eventual support for SharePlay will arrive with tvOS 15&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1FPUPb"&gt;Plus, tvOS is also getting a handful of less flashy but nonetheless functionally exciting updates. Beginning with tvOS 15, Apple TV users will see an on-screen prompt to connect their AirPods for easy silent streaming, and the AirPods Pro or AirPods Max will also get support for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt; when connected to the Apple TV for a theater-like experience. The update will also introduce HomePod Mini pairing as well as a HomeKit update that will allow Apple TV users to see multiple home camera feeds at once. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about whether any of these other expected features would be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXl0z9"&gt;tvOS 15 will be supported on the Apple TV HD, Apple TV 4K (2017), and the latest Apple TV 4K (2021). Look for the software update in the settings menu on your Apple TV device beginning next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyU16X"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;are launching officially on September 20th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but you can test them in the public beta right now if you’re willing to risk encountering possible bugs. Here, we walk you through the steps for installing the software. It’s a similar process for the iPhone and iPad, but we’ve made separate sections for each OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TncjxD"&gt;As expected, Apple announced the release date at its September event, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;it also showed off the new iPhone 13, iPad Mini with USB-C charging, and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFiozr"&gt;Before we get started, here’s the usual word of warning about installing unfinished beta software: these releases may seem stable for general use, but they could contain some bugs. Your experience may differ from others depending on the apps you use. And finally, if you do decide to install, I suggest backing up your device’s data, in case things go badly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdqQYd6S1VclYKqBImQmlJQ5trA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643660/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GE7efX"&gt;What are the new features that come with iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ajIb8j"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;new features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; include updates to FaceTime, Messages, notifications, privacy controls, and much more. For example, FaceTime will support spatial audio and reflect the speaker’s location on-screen, with a new voice isolation ability that can remove background noise. Other changes for FaceTime include the ability to share music and videos during calls and to invite Android users to a FaceTime call with a shareable link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhlCIp"&gt;SharePlay, which will allow people to enjoy streaming entertainment together at the same time, was one of iOS 15’s most anticipated features, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;Apple recently decided that it won’t arrive&lt;/a&gt; in the final version of iOS 15 launching on September 20th. Instead, it’ll arrive later in fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RjIx6e"&gt;What devices are supported for iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C29a2b"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4rqkT"&gt;iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4MYuU8"&gt;iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWbtK7"&gt;iPhone X, iPhone XR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gPzYC"&gt;iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xXbea7"&gt;iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CrMC2z"&gt;iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WTQtvI"&gt;iPhone SE (first and second generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jl56Ou"&gt;iPod Touch (seventh generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A0LR1r"&gt;How to install the iOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwP76L"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your phone’s Safari browser and agree to sign in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TSasnT"&gt;Select “Enroll Your Devices” within the drop-down menu at the top right of the webpage, if it automatically doesn’t route you there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pUOjHU"&gt;Select “iOS,” which is the left-most option on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to make sure that you’ve sent a backup of your phone’s content to your macOS computer, in case you need to revert to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxm87C"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then tap on it. This will bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You will get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d1bnSQ"&gt;Open the Settings app. A new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you’ll have access to the beta software download. You may need to restart your phone for the profile to activate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yJf4ys"&gt;Congrats, you did it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67NLyjVyqi1TZegsQ794RWjvKic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643196/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.49.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WEwIsU"&gt;What are the new features that come with iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Ft4C"&gt;This year’s version of iPadOS makes the home screen more customizable, and it makes split-screen multitasking easier. The App Library feature introduced last year in iOS 14 has made its way to this new iPad software. Additionally, many of the features that Apple is bringing to iOS 15 are also coming to the tablet lineup, including more spatial audio for FaceTime, portrait mode, and SharePlay, which lets you watch TV or listen to music with others who are on the call. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;Chris Welch wrote all about the new features here&lt;/a&gt;, including a section on how iPadOS 15 “punts for another year on ‘pro’ requests,” delivering features that will appeal more generally to people instead of ones for pro-level users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pS9XwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says you can build apps on an iPad now, but devs say the reality is trickier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534902/ipad-pro-apple-swift-playgrounds-4-wwdc-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kMvcyI"&gt;What devices are supported for iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2amtEx"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gYFnXh"&gt;iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first through fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7awfUC"&gt;iPad Pro 11-inch (first through third generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nSheDn"&gt;iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q39aHn"&gt;iPad Pro 9.7-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LooIpb"&gt;iPad (fifth through eighth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0fRC4p"&gt;iPad Mini (fourth and fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gb9MY"&gt;iPad Air (second through fourth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OEDSbC"&gt;How to download the iPadOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vRB6nl"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your iPad’s Safari browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VyVf4p"&gt;Click “Enroll Your Devices” at the top of the webpage (you may need to scroll horizontally to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JizQFZ"&gt;Click “iPadOS,” which is the option that’s second from the left on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to first make a backup on your macOS computer in case you need to revert your OS to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7E9jLb"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then select it. This may bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You’ll get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vgHgoU"&gt;Open the Settings app, and a new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you should have access to the beta software download. You might need to restart your iPad first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aMnO1y"&gt;Lastly, if nothing prompts you to get started with the download, open the Settings app, head to General, then find “Software Update” to install the beta software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 is a pitch-perfect iPhone 12S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUFXBjqnWjabkSZro3YqcNX8z84=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69862804/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13, featuring a very similar design to the iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JI022T"&gt;Apple had a lot of new features to announce with its iPhone 13 lineup this week. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; have better battery life, faster A15 Bionic processors, smaller display notches, upgraded cameras, and, when it comes to the Pro models, high refresh rate 120Hz ProMotion displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwsNDn"&gt;It’s a nice collection of updates, but take a step back and the range starts to look an awful lot like an iterative update over last year’s iPhone 12. They have an almost identical look to the squared-off design introduced with last year’s models, and Apple was careful to not directly compare the performance of its new A15 Bionic chip to last year’s A14 Bionic, only to its competitors. There’s also no major new initiative like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;MagSafe ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; that Apple kicked off last year, and on the bottom of the phones you’ll see the same old Lightning port rather than USB-C. It all feels very familiar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lcv5Zw"&gt;So it’s no wonder that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheTechChap/status/1437847213594587136"&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AbhyudayaMohan/status/1437843526323040261"&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1437837861454106626"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; immediately responded to the phones’ announcement by referring to them as the “iPhone 12S,” aka a minor update to last year’s iPhone 12. That’s how Apple used to name its phones. There’d be a major update one year, usually with a big design change, followed up with a more minor revision that changed some internal components and features but kept the overall look and feel the same. The iPhone 3GS, 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS all used this approach. So what changed?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 5S 1024" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SL25tWylCs3ChepHV76_qzTKiCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13062703/IMG_3022-1024.1419979922.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Michael Shane / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 5S, which added a fingerprint sensor to Apple’s smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GGPTl4"&gt;Apple started to move away from this formula with 2016’s iPhone 7. Not only did the iPhone 7 break the cycle by using a very similar design to the previous year’s 6S instead of a new look (aside, of course, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12823596/apple-iphone-7-no-headphone-jack-lightning-earbuds"&gt;infamous missing headphone jack&lt;/a&gt;), but it was never followed by an S-model of its own. Instead, the next year Apple jumped straight to the iPhone 8, a minor revision that absolutely deserved to be called the 7S, and which ended up being completely overshadowed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review"&gt;that year’s iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsSCKp"&gt;Ever since 2018’s iPhone XS, it seems like Apple has abandoned the S-suffix entirely. Every year gets a new number, regardless of whether it offers a major overhaul like the iPhone 12 or a more minor update like the iPhone 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNdWnB"&gt;Of course, Apple’s closest competitor in the US, Samsung, has been using this approach for years. Every subsequent Galaxy S device has had a bigger number than its predecessor, and nobody wants to be the company with the lower-numbered phone than its rival. In fact, if Apple &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;released an iPhone 7S in 2017 it would have competed against Samsung’s Galaxy S8. No wonder Apple jumped straight to 8 and skipped the iPhone 9 entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqP5Nz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s wild in retrospect that Apple willingly advertised its “off” years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WKhPf"&gt;In retrospect it seems absolutely wild that Apple was willing to proudly broadcast that it was having an off year. Unless you were the kind of smartphone user that wanted to have the most up-to-date iPhone year after year, that S-suffix was a helpful indication that a new model only contained minor changes. “Don’t worry about upgrading this year, folks,” was the implicit message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXO6qh"&gt;But the reality was that smartphone technology was advancing so quickly at the time that even a “minor” upgrade could still contain massive new features. The iPhone 3GS was the first iPhone that could officially record video in addition to taking photos, the iPhone 4S introduced Apple’s Siri voice assistant to the world, and the 5S was the first iPhone with biometric security (a fingerprint sensor). These are all major additions that we now take for granted on modern Apple devices, and they arrived with the relatively muted fanfare of an S-branded iPhone. The S-branded iPhones also offered big camera improvements over the years: the 4S was the first with an 8-megapixel camera, the 5S added slow-motion video, and the 6S increased the rear camera’s resolution to 12 megapixels. Every year, Apple gave its customers a pretty good reason to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iphone 6s" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08MMY8EtNQN_-E4JW2hG6tBI1xU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4084770/iphone-6s-clean-2-15__1_.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6S, the first iPhone with a 12-megapixel camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="irYQi1"&gt;The smartphone market is now a very different place. Smartphones have matured, and even midrange models offer basically everything most people actually need a phone to do. Every year we’re told about the latest phones’ performance upgrades and edge-case camera improvements, but it’s nothing that’s going to completely change your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Uvi33"&gt;Consumers have noticed. Far from upgrading to the latest iPhone every year, as of 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/smartphone-users-are-waiting-longer-before-upgrading-heres-why.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt; that US customers were waiting an average of over two years to upgrade their phones, while in the UK people were waiting almost 28 months. At the time, these figures were all trending upward, and it seems safe to assume that they’ve grown even longer in the two years since. It was also around this time that iPhone sales &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166399/iphone-android-apple-samsung-smartphone-sales-peak"&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940562/apple-q4-2019-earnings-iphone-sales-record-revenue-slow-services-income-mac-ipad-tim-cook"&gt;plateau&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18053782/apple-earnings-q4-2018-stop-ipad-iphone-mac-unit-sales-disclosure"&gt;Apple stopped reporting on iPhone sales numbers&lt;/a&gt;, opting instead to bundle their numbers in with other device categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vil21C"&gt;Instead of focusing on big upgrades, Apple seems to be prioritizing a bigger lineup with devices to appeal to different tastes and price points. As recently as 2017, the company was selling just two flagship phones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The following year it released three (the 8, 8 Plus, and X), and last year it switched to four with the iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max. With so many form factors to keep updated, it’s not surprising that big overhauls have become less common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nhsk6R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;People upgrade much less frequently than they once did&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCYiaF"&gt;Unless you really want the latest and greatest technology, there really isn’t much of a reason to upgrade every year, and that’s a good thing! It’s much more affordable for those people who opt to buy their phones outright, and it’s worlds better for the environment. Apple may now be using more recycled materials in its devices, but manufacturing them and shipping them in the first place still uses resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBFxeT"&gt;In this context, it isn’t surprising that Apple has changed with the times. For starters, it’s making more of an effort to make money outside of hardware, like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;increasingly broad array of subscription services&lt;/a&gt; covering everything from music and video streaming, to gaming and home fitness. If it can’t make money from selling you a new iPhone every year, it’ll sure as hell try to make money from you streaming the latest season of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hty5L5"&gt;That doesn’t mean that Apple has given up on the idea of selling you a new phone every year. Far from it. If branding this year’s phones as the iPhone 13 tells us anything, it’s that Apple is more keen than ever to convince its customers to upgrade, by branding this year’s phones as an all-new range as opposed to a more modest update to the iPhone 12. The slowing progress of smartphone technology means that Apple can’t afford to rest on its laurels with an S-branded device. Everything needs to be brand-new and as exciting as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYnqtS"&gt;So yes, this year’s iPhones could, and arguably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been branded as the iPhone 12S. But the smartphone industry has changed, and Apple has changed with it.&lt;/p&gt;
