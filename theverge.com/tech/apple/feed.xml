    <title>‘Misogynistic’ Apple hire is out hours after employees call for investigation </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xIq2dM"&gt;Antonio García Martínez is no longer working at Apple hours after employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;circulated a petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for an investigation into his hiring. Martínez, a former Facebook product manager on the ad targeting team, authored a controversial book about Silicon Valley where he expressed misogynistic views on women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpSEnr"&gt;“We are deeply concerned about the recent hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” employees wrote in the petition. “His misogynistic statements in his autobiography — such as ‘&lt;em&gt;Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit’&lt;/em&gt; (further quoted below this letter) — directly oppose Apple’s commitment to Inclusion &amp;amp; Diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9PmH"&gt;More than 2,000 employees signed the petition before it was published by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0Yuvq"&gt;Shortly after the petition began circulating internally at Apple, Martínez’s Slack account was deactivated. The ad platforms team was called into an emergency meeting where it was confirmed Martínez would no longer be working at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BROfl5"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Apple spokesperson said: “At Apple, we have always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted. Behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSNvUd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jBojf7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 12, 9:36pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Apple has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;Antonio García Martínez is no longer with the company.&lt;/a&gt; The original story is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="68Mi9m"&gt;
&lt;p id="CwfNSW"&gt;A group of Apple employees has written a petition asking for an investigation into the hiring of Antonio García Martínez — a former Facebook product manager and author of the book &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2D4443"&gt;In the petition, the employees expressed concern about García Martínez’s views on women and people of color. His hiring “calls into question parts of our system of inclusion at Apple, including hiring panels, background checks, and our process to ensure our existing culture of inclusion is strong enough to withstand individuals who don’t share our inclusive values,” they write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9PmH"&gt;More than 2,000 employees signed the letter prior to its publication in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAagkL"&gt;García Martínez, who has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/author/antonio-garcia-martinez/"&gt;also written for &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was the product manager for Facebook’s ad targeting team from 2011 to 2013. Most of the things the Apple employees have expressed concern about come from &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys&lt;/em&gt; itself. (The book is dedicated to “all my enemies.”) The autobiography traces García Martínez going from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. García Martínez has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/8/9/12415696/antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-recode-decode-podcast-transcript"&gt;described the book&lt;/a&gt; as “total Hunter S. Thompson/Gonzo mode.” The employees, in the petition, view it differently: they say it’s racist and sexist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NDEfjB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s so exhausting being a woman in tech; sitting opposite men who think because of my gender, I am soft and weak and generally full of shit”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0fs9Ja"&gt;One screenshot from the book that has been circulating on Twitter calls women in the Bay area “soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7Fqto"&gt;“It’s so exhausting being a woman in tech; sitting opposite men who think because of my gender, I am soft and weak and generally full of shit,” wrote an Apple employee on Twitter, drawing attention to the quote. “It’s not even worth it to say I have worked relentlessly for every accomplishment I have.” The tweet also contained a screenshot of the passage in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qnioq"&gt;Silicon Valley has consistently had a white, male workforce. There are some in the Valley, such as notorious ex-Googler James Damore, who suggest this is because women and people of color &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16153740/tech-diversity-problem-science-history-explainer-inequality"&gt;lack the innate qualities needed to succeed in tech&lt;/a&gt;. But wave after wave of sex discrimination lawsuits tell a different story: that underrepresented groups have been &lt;em&gt;prevented&lt;/em&gt; from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGKFPT"&gt;At Apple, women make up 40 percent of the workforce but only 23 percent of the research and development teams, according to the company’s most recent diversity report. Half of the workforce is white, and 27 percent is Asian. “Across Apple, we’ve strengthened our long-standing commitment to making our company more inclusive and the world more just,” reads the header on the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/diversity/"&gt;website containing the report&lt;/a&gt;. “Where every great idea can be heard. And everybody belongs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRBLvn"&gt;Here’s the full text of the letter, which began circulating today (emphasis theirs): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="cuSgMh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10496899"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7sD6yz"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic v. Apple keeps coming back to the gap between ignorance and inconvenience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/58SAFjI73j_WHaXt4TY_U6lokRM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272119/vpavic_180607_2652_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LSZxry"&gt;Last week, the judge in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;asked whether Epic really had an antitrust case against Apple, or whether it just wanted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419894/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-2"&gt;help kids make impulse purchases&lt;/a&gt;. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers was talking about the importance of where and how&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;people pay for their apps, and today she continued that line of questioning to the point of suggesting a kind of App Store policy change that Epic never originally put on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwAZu0"&gt;Epic sued Apple for banning &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from iOS over a direct payment system for V-Bucks, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game currency. Epic called that unfair and monopolistic. But Apple argued that it lets developers sell in-app purchases through its Safari browser, even at a discounted price — so there’s no lockout. And while Epic itself has focused on explaining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;why web apps aren’t a good substitute for native ones&lt;/a&gt;, its expert witness David Evans brought up another major issue: anti-steering rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zkfpT"&gt;Anti-steering rules (in this context) &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_2093"&gt;refer to rules that ban&lt;/a&gt; developers from pointing users outside of Apple’s ecosystem. iOS developers can’t add links or references telling people to get a better deal on their website, or send emails to accounts created through Apple. Android has these rules too, but it &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/google-announces-crackdown-on-in-app-billing-aimed-at-netflix-and-spotify/"&gt;delayed a serious crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on them until this fall — and since you can install third-party stores and sideload apps on Android, developers in Google’s ecosystem have more options in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AhA7LQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An Epic witness compared app makers to moonlighting Uber drivers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNqBnD"&gt;Evans, an economist, was originally trying to explain in-app purchases by comparing Apple to a ride-hailing app like Uber, comparing an app developer to a Uber driver who had struck up a good relationship with a customer. The customer wanted to start directly hiring the driver, but the ride-hailing company (representing Apple) demanded that the customer keep paying through its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqngEz"&gt;Judge Rogers didn’t appear convinced. Buying V-Bucks through a browser, she noted, seemed a lot like a passenger directly paying a driver. “There’s nothing about that distribution process that impacted differently given your Uber example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nExCIp"&gt;Evans basically responded that in this analogy, cab drivers can’t even do the equivalent of giving passengers their phone numbers. “Epic is not able to message the iOS app user and tell them ‘You can go to the web and get this more cheaply.’ Or ‘I really encourage you to go to the web and get V-Bucks there,’” Evans objected. The problem, he said, was the combination of requiring Epic to use Apple payment processing, plus a “whole set of barriers” that make it harder to tell users they have an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gml1aD"&gt;These anti-steering provisions have come up in the trial before — yoga app maker Yoga Buddhi complained about them last week. But this time, Rogers offered an obvious followup question. If there was no anti-steering provision, she asked, would Epic still have a problem with Apple’s system? “The customer could choose whether they wanted to stay and make the purchase on the app or do it some other way, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3U1sKW"&gt;Evans admitted that nixing the anti-steering provisions “wouldn’t eliminate the market power that Apple has here, but it would certainly diminish it.” He said it would be more helpful for some apps than others — it’s pretty good for subscription-based companies that have a separate website, for instance, and less useful for mobile-only games that rely on a stream of microtransactions. But he acknowledged he hadn’t conducted a specific study of the topic, so he wasn’t sure exactly &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;big the issue would still be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RixG0U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumers do get klutzy and disconnected”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rfvFm6"&gt;Later in the day, economist Susan Athey raised a different issue with App Store exclusivity. The App Store lets users sign up for subscriptions, but if they switch to an Android phone, they have to either cancel their subscription or keep managing it through Apple. Athey was using this to explain why a third-party app store would be useful, should Apple ever allow one to exist — if you could access the same purchase from both big phone platforms, the same way you can get your old iOS apps on a new iPhone, switching devices could become much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Okte7i"&gt;But Rogers suggested again that if developers could just tell people to sign up through the web, “then there wouldn’t really be the same kind of need for the kind of cross-platform app store that you’re talking about.” After all, services like Netflix already direct people to sign up through their websites — Apple and Google just really don’t like it, and they try to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;discourage the practice&lt;/a&gt; without an actual ban. Similar to Evans, Athey conceded that there’d be a “big benefit” in letting app makers “alert people to the most efficient way to pay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVwlre"&gt;Athey argued that “consumers do get klutzy and disconnected and sensitive to delays when trying to complete that type of activity,” and telling people to go use a web browser doesn’t solve that problem. But Rogers could easily decide that inconvenience and enforced ignorance are separate issues, and that only the latter is a serious antitrust concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXDmwY"&gt;Getting rid of anti-steering provisions would be a comparatively small win for Epic, which wants to put full-fledged third-party App Stores on iOS. But it’s a smartphone ecosystem feature that’s often overshadowed by bigger antitrust complaints — and &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; is putting it under the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter is the new name of Project CHIP, the partnership that promises to simplify your smart home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/epha63qFJ9tZiyXSdZwKbEQHEpg=/249x0:1881x1088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269556/matter.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yym2p2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427139/amazon-apple-google-zigbee-alliance-open-source-smart-home-standard-2021-launch"&gt;Project Connected Home over IP (CHIP)&lt;/a&gt; — the ambitious smart home partnership that will see Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, the Zigbee Alliance, and dozens of other companies work together on an open standard — has gotten a new name: Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCp9iP"&gt;The rebranding comes ahead of the first Matter certifications, which are set to arrive before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387252/project-chip-will-finally-ship-later-this-year"&gt;the end of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The new branding and logo are designed to help make it easier for customers to tell which devices work with Matter’s unified system, with the logo set to appear on future hardware products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-v7LDftjLpwcTSLmERNUBtqukyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506925/Matter_Smart_Bulb.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="03T3RD"&gt;The goal of Matter is deceptively simple: make sure you’re able to use your smart home devices with the voice assistant (or assistants) of choice, whether that’s Apple’s Siri / HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. At launch, Matter will run on Ethernet Wi-Fi, Thread, and Bluetooth Low Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLRZUM"&gt;Other big companies, like Philips Hue, are on board: the company has already promised to release a simple software update in the coming months that will make all of its past and present products compatible with Matter once it launches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2phxrb"&gt;It’s an ambitious goal, which could vastly simplify the confusing parts of smart home setup — assuming companies are willing to put in the work to issue software updates and integrate the standard into their current and future products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2Mpwn"&gt;As part of the announcement, the Zigbee Alliance (which created the Zigbee standard for interconnected smart home gadgets) has announced that it’ll rename itself to the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) as it expands to focus more on projects like Matter in addition to the existing Zigbee network.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic and Apple are now fighting over a naked banana</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortnite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lNdLJPQSqJo2rjPBXZ9IgS5cIq4=/0x0:1352x901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69266448/Fortnite_20200221130836.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rcoquR"&gt;As the trial for &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; entered its second week, both parties took a break from antitrust law to argue over whether bananas should wear clothes in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBa6N7"&gt;The banana in question is Peely, a humanoid fruit avatar from Epic’s game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, as you may remember, is at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;the center of the huge lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; between Apple and Epic. The trial’s sixth day began with testimony from Matthew Weissinger, Epic’s VP of marketing. And Apple used its cross-examination to offer the court an exhaustive tutorial on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, beginning with its title screen and one of its skins. Hence the banana:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8c9EI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; We have in front of us a new set of images, and what is this screen showing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBv9zJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; This is your matchmaking lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHgS33"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And we have a large yellow banana here, don’t we? In a tuxedo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yumHw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. That is Peely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bj22g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And that’s Peely, did you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRq4aC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJyvjd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And in fact, in the tuxedo, he’s known as Agent Peely, correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyNyik"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHbsrk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; We thought it better to go with the suit than the naked banana, since we are in federal court this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MxYsLF"&gt;Peely’s &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/even-apple-knows-fortnites-peely-is-a-monster-1846860238?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=kotaku"&gt;nightmarish existence&lt;/a&gt; is barely related to Apple’s case. And the “naked banana” comment would probably have passed for a throwaway joke, but for one very important fact: Apple slammed Epic last week by claiming that it hosted porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GyoLNt"&gt;On Friday, an Apple attorney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;went after indie storefront Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, which Epic lets users install through the Epic Games Store. The attorney noted that Itch.io included “so-called adult games” whose descriptions were “not appropriate for us to speak in federal courts,” calling them “both offensive and sexualized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IposXU"&gt;Epic Games Store manager Steven Allison defended Itch.io, but the exchange may have stung Epic. Or at least, that’s the best explanation I can imagine for what happened two hours later — when Epic’s attorney decided to revisit Peely during her own questioning of Weissinger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3LA2Yx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; A little bit of a digression. We talked about Peely? Our banana? Remember that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpltRh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGD6uA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And there might have been an implication that to show Peely without a suit would have been inappropriate. Do you recall that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrFwda"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaZwfn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there anything inappropriate about Peely without a suit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAlVPW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; No, there is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31doiF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; If we could just put on the screen a picture of Peely — is there anything inappropriate about Peely without clothes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hlMm3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s just a banana, ma’am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rso1D4"&gt;This does, somewhat astonishingly, relate to the core issues in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple.&lt;/em&gt; Epic is suing to make Apple open up iOS to alternative app stores like the Epic Games Store. Apple claims this would expose users to malicious and low-quality apps. It used Itch.io to paint Epic as a sloppy guardian of its users’ safety, and Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers seemed to take Apple’s concern at least somewhat seriously. It’s unclear whether Rogers actually thought there was a graphically naked banana-person in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but Epic’s attorney clearly didn’t want to take that chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FXFTR"&gt;But the Peely exchange still epitomized just how rambling and off-topic some of today’s testimony felt. Apple’s tutorial was clearly aimed at showing that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is mostly a game and not an “experience” or “metaverse” — encouraging the judge to weigh the App Store’s game-related policies against similar rules on consoles, rather than scrutinizing the whole iOS ecosystem. Still, the result felt like a college freshman padding an English essay with a blow-by-blow plot summary — or in this case, a blow-by-blow description of how to complete a skydiving challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVWnjH"&gt;And despite Apple and Epic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;often very funny debate&lt;/a&gt; over the definition of a game, the case will probably hinge on drier-sounding questions like those discussed by Epic’s first expert witness, the economist David Evans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zkyo08"&gt;Evans argued that Apple is running an unfair single-brand monopoly: basically, it sells pricey devices that lock users into an ecosystem with no reasonable alternatives for getting certain apps, beyond tossing their phone or tablet and spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on a new one. Developers can offer cheaper in-app purchases on the web or a different platform, but Apple won’t let iOS apps direct users to these savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfE9wV"&gt;Judge Rogers asked some skeptical questions about Evans’ testimony, and Epic will almost certainly try to hammer his points harder. Hopefully, both parties will let Peely slip — but who knows, maybe the banana clothing issue will remain a split in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony now lets you use the DualSense pad to play PS5 on your nearby Mac, iPhone, iPad, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xn7yKyzSC-ZnTSHtZKmvKXzkscw=/0x212:2200x1679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69265140/20210510_Sean_Hollister_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TtiSeS"&gt;It’s a little-known fact that you can sling a PS5 or PS4 to another room of your house, streaming your games to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/1/11138016/playstation-4-remote-play-pc-mac-feature"&gt;Mac or Windows PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902406/sony-ps4-firmware-update-remote-play-android"&gt;iOS or Android device&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;or even an old PS4&lt;/a&gt; with Sony’s PS Remote Play app. But until recently, you could only remotely control your shiny new PlayStation 5 with the old DualShock 4 gamepad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dloisn"&gt;That’s now changing, as Sony has just announced the PS5’s new DualShock controller is supported &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pair-dualsense-controller-bluetooth/"&gt;across every Apple platform running the latest operating system&lt;/a&gt;, including iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Apple TVs running 14.5 and Macs running macOS Big Sur 11.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZlGGmR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Remote Play is now available using the DualSense wireless controller to play compatible games on a range of Apple devices. Full details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4fpa77oFqx"&gt;https://t.co/4fpa77oFqx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z2BlehDLjO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z2BlehDLjO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1391822847924973579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGsa9D"&gt;I just gave it a quick try myself with an iPhone 12 mini and a recent iPad Pro, and I have some thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUleMM"&gt;The good news: if the only controller you own is a DualSense controller, it totally works — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21547303/sony-ps5-dualsense-adaptive-triggers-haptics-teardown-featuresver"&gt;your awesome adaptive triggers&lt;/a&gt; come along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEuqyp"&gt;Here is some bad news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0ogOnp"&gt;There’s no haptic feedback. Absolutely zero. It feels extremely weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="izZOmp"&gt;Each time you want to switch devices (to your iPhone or back to your PS5), you’ll have to manually pair your DualSense again. That was true of previous pads as well, but I was hoping they’d fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QMN2GW"&gt;The built-in microphone, headphone jack, and speaker don’t work. The speaker is a serious loss — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;games like&lt;em&gt; Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;use it in combination with haptic feedback to add some serious immersion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HV1yCY"&gt;The streaming quality, as always, will depend heavily on your home wireless network. Give it a try, though; it’s free! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="o5EbHy"&gt;You’ll have to decide whether these things defeat the purpose of pairing a DualSense with an Apple device. As far as I’m concerned, I’ll keep my DualSense hooked up to the PS5 where it can actually help me sense things, and use a DualShock 4 (or third-party pad) when I want to stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sM77R2"&gt;It’s also more ammunition for the argument that we should be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352382/sony-ps5-playstation-4-controllers-new-ps4-support-games"&gt;play PS5 games on our PS5 with a PS4 pad&lt;/a&gt;. This is the second time Sony has shown that limitation is totally arbitrary: first when it allowed us to &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/you-can-play-ps5-games-with-a-dualshock-4-if-you-use-remote-play/'"&gt;control PS5 games with the PS4 controller over Remote Play&lt;/a&gt; to start, and now again with this signal that the DualSense’s sensing abilities are optional when streaming games over a network.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A special thanks to the person who combined the Apple TV remote and an AirTag</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5koe4"&gt;Here are a few unrelated facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aQ7mJV"&gt;Up until few weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;Apple was selling the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, one of the least popular (and most easily lost) remote controls ever made, with a slick glass and metal chassis that’s practically designed to slip behind a couch cushion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="urzuRn"&gt;Apple also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released its AirTag trackers&lt;/a&gt;, which use a Bluetooth network of Apple devices and local ultra-wideband tracking to help locate missing items, whether they’re across town or a few feet away in the room with you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G827Fn"&gt;The AirTag tracker has a small speaker, so you can find it buried in a couch or under a pile of throw pillows. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PLzRgk"&gt;Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;redesigned the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which it announced at the same event as the AirTags trackers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IT482B"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394335/apple-u1-uwb-locator-missing-ipad-pro-apple-tv-siri-remote"&gt;did not include&lt;/a&gt; a UWB chip in the new Siri Remote to allow users with recent iPhone devices to track said remote if they manage to lose it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u0lcDd"&gt;Apple is a company that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fcases-protection&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;produces cases&lt;/a&gt; for almost all of its products (including the iPhone, iPad, and AirTag tracker) — but not either iteration of the Siri Remote. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y0qE35"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208492"&gt;Apple’s official support document&lt;/a&gt; for “If you lost the remote for your Apple TV,” advocates that users either use the Apple TV remote function integrated into iOS devices or just buy a new one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eKO9Wj"&gt;My Apple TV remote is &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in my living room, and no, I don’t have any idea where it is. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="NGU6xw"&gt;With all that said, it’s no surprise that enterprising creators are already making 3D-printed templates for a case for the original Siri Remote that allows you to slot in both the remote and an AirTag tracker so that you can actually find it the next time you lose it in a couch. There are already &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=airtag+remote&amp;amp;type=things&amp;amp;sort=relevant"&gt;several available from Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F1015765067%2Fairtag-case-for-apple-tv-siri-remote%3Fgpla%3D1%26gao%3D1%26%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dshopping_us_e-electronics_and_accessories-electronics_cases-phone_cases%26utm_custom1%3D_k_Cj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIYcE9TPgLwISANYDJRm3pZGfmPwoOQTatroAzaz6kVfOLIPDoYLQNcaAjs9EALw_wcB_k_%26utm_content%3Dgo_1843970791_69629621997_346364498394_pla-352374535867_c__1015765067_12768591%26utm_custom2%3D1843970791%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIYcE9TPgLwISANYDJRm3pZGfmPwoOQTatroAzaz6kVfOLIPDoYLQNcaAjs9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Etsy store selling files&lt;/a&gt;, and even an enterprising &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F224454921320%3Fchn%3Dps%26var%3D523239022404%26norover%3D1%26mkevt%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-117182-37290-0%26mkcid%3D2%26itemid%3D523239022404_224454921320%26targetid%3D882300791467%26device%3Dc%26mktype%3Dpla%26googleloc%3D9003653%26poi%3D%26campaignid%3D1669934603%26mkgroupid%3D65058347419%26rlsatarget%3Dpla-882300791467%26abcId%3D1123856%26merchantid%3D6296724%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIaUm-mnPxWXR9m6x20Zn9U11qEZG6mxRRI2zzO51zF1CKHnRApJT8MaAuBzEALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay seller&lt;/a&gt; that’ll print and ship you one if you don’t have a 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ6vMH"&gt;To be clear, this is the lamest workaround for the fact that Apple didn’t just put a UWB chip and a tiny speaker in its $60 remote. It can’t be a cost thing: AirTags have one and they only cost $30. Roku has been putting tiny speakers in its remotes to make them easier to find for years. There was &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/29/siris-find-my-support-apple-tv-remote/"&gt;even a strange message&lt;/a&gt; in Siri that seemed to hint at the possibility of finding a lost Siri Remote using the virtual assistant — but Apple removed the message a few hours later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nuqmlO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I really &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; find my Apple TV’s remote&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ao5LvK"&gt;As such, I cannot explain why Apple has refused to embark down this mind-bogglingly obvious path. But I am puzzled why Apple isn’t making a nicer version of this exact 3D printed concept (ideally out of nicer, more durable materials that actually match the rest of the hardware and would be more enjoyable to use on a daily basis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbH7UO"&gt;Apple loves selling unnecessary hardware accessories (like its various AirTag keychain cases, which cost more than the AirTags and solve the self-inflicted issue of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;not having a loop built right into the device&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTzobV"&gt;For Apple, it’s a no-brainer to make a case (that adds functionality that Apple should have included right out of the box) that would almost certainly exceed the cost of the remote &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; require the additional purchase of a different Apple product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAWPhg"&gt;And yet, for all my mockery here, I really &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; find my Apple TV’s remote. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days, and in iOS 14.5, which is starting to roll out to the public today, there are new privacy features that may make you feel happier but are not endearing Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;The new feature is aptly called App Tracking Transparency. Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The new version of iOS allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you won’t have to do anything; you’ll be automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track, and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="Ne1PGZ"&gt;(Note: At first, the App Tracking Transparency feature seemed to be misbehaving for some people; it either didn’t respond or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;the toggle in Tracking was grayed out&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Apple suppliers linked to Uyghur forced labor in new report</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v9l0IJ"&gt;Several Apple suppliers may have used forced labor in China, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/seven-apple-suppliers-accused-of-using-forced-labor-from-xinjiang"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Working with two human rights groups, the publication identified seven companies that supplied products or services to Apple and supported forced labor programs, according to statements made by the Chinese government. The programs target the country’s Muslim minority population, particularly Uyghurs living in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjTPW"&gt;Six of the seven suppliers were said to participate in work programs operated by the Chinese government, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports, which human rights groups describe as frequently offering cover for forced labor. Workers can be jailed for refusing to join the work programs, the report says, and those enrolled in the programs are often moved far from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl0OY3"&gt;One of the suppliers operated in Xinjiang, the region of China predominantly populated by Uyghurs and where the most egregious human rights violations &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/inside-xinjiang-detention-camp"&gt;have reportedly taken place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wL5Jyw"&gt;The companies supplied Apple with antennas, cables, and coatings, among other products and services, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glfQLl"&gt;Apple “found no evidence of forced labor anywhere we operate,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. Apple said it looks for forced labor as part of “every assessment” it conducts. “We will continue doing all we can to protect workers and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgJ34z"&gt;The problem is not Apple’s alone. The tech industry at large relies on suppliers in China, and &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports that these companies have also worked with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, among others. (Amazon and Facebook told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; they wouldn’t work with suppliers using forced labor; Google and Microsoft didn’t respond.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeynMT"&gt;China’s forced work programs have been &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html"&gt;getting more attention&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, with new reports speaking to the growing scope of China’s oppressive practices in Xinjiang. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; finding more than 100 detention facilities located beside factories.  In January, &lt;a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/determination-of-the-secretary-of-state-on-atrocities-in-xinjiang/index.html"&gt;the Trump administration said&lt;/a&gt; China was “committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcbbAE"&gt;Apple’s supply chain has previously been linked to forced labor in China. The Tech Transparency Project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;said a glass supplier&lt;/a&gt; was using forced labor in December; Apple said it had seen no evidence of forced labor. In March, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/shares-of-china-s-ofilm-drop-after-firm-loses-foreign-customer"&gt;cut ties with another supplier&lt;/a&gt; over allegations it was connected to coercive government labor programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple invests another $45 million in Gorilla Glass maker Corning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4n_Ay95t5IS-URje6SNzqrAFuA=/11x0:1949x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69261932/Apple_awards_Corning_an_additional_45_million_dollars_team_member_051021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corning manufactures glass for Apple and many Android device makers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PU0nfd"&gt;Apple is awarding Corning another $45 million investment from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund, in addition to the $450 million it’s already given to the US-based company over the past four years. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-awards-corning-45-million-from-its-advanced-manufacturing-fund%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428372%2Fapple-corning-45-million-investment-gorilla-glass-ceramic-shield-foldable-bendable-glass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the investment will “expand Corning’s manufacturing capacity in the US and drive research and development into innovative new technologies that support durability and long-lasting product life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFS5I0"&gt;Corning provides glass for a variety of Apple products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The two companies have a history &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687299/plastic-iphone-gorilla-glass-origin-story-steve-jobs"&gt;dating back to the original iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, they collaborated on the iPhone 12 lineup’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509008/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-mini-displays-ceramic-hardened"&gt;Ceramic Shield technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple claims is “tougher than any smartphone glass” and makes its latest flagships four times more resistant to damage from drops. As well as Apple, Corning’s Gorilla Glass is used in phones from &lt;a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/products-with-gorilla-glass/smartphones.html"&gt;countless Android manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; including Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uh0Yrf1t9rpNe1vgj3Ofrwsth9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19729421/corning_4k_bendable_glass.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corning’s ultra-thin glass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VmUHFo"&gt;Apple doesn’t say exactly how Corning will use the $45 million investment, but its timing coincides with &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/02/kuo-8-inch-foldable-iphone-2023/"&gt;recent reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple could launch a foldable iPhone in 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251328/apple-corning-foldable-display-gorilla-glass-bendable-smartphone"&gt;Back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; we heard Corning was developing a bendable version of its glass, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;last February&lt;/a&gt; the company said it expects devices using the technology to reach the market in 12 to 18 months. If it works, the glass could allow for durable foldable smartphones that don’t require a layer of plastic protection used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything"&gt;Samsung’s latest foldables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvSteK"&gt;“Today, when you buy a phone with Gorilla Glass, you’re touching glass … that’s what we’re working towards,” Corning said of its ambitions for bendable glass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
