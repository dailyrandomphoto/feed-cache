    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can’t say we like Samsung’s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it’s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wFbUhR"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 / S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QzSdip"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hvSkHC"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is the only small phone on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a step down from the 9 Pro, but it only gives up a few features at a significantly lower price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ofDQRV"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZJWuDD"&gt;If you want an excellent ultrawide camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uUgURs"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is the step-down model from the OnePlus 9 Pro, which is itself an excellent phone. But you don’t give up too much by opting for the 9, and you save a ton of money. Like the 9 Pro, it offers great performance with a Snapdragon 888 processor, fast 65W wired charging, and something that will appeal especially to the landscape photographers out there: a great ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2S7w"&gt;The sensor behind the OnePlus 9’s ultrawide camera is physically larger than most and offers a healthy 50-megapixel resolution. A unique lens design corrects distortion without introducing the funhouse mirror-type stretching you’ll often see in the corners of ultrawide images. And if super-wide photography isn’t your thing, know that the main camera turns in solid image quality, too. Images are well-exposed, and colors look pleasantly vibrant. OnePlus makes a big deal of the Hasselblad color science at work here, which does a fine job but isn’t as mind-blowingly good as the company suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O804KE"&gt;Unfortunately, you do miss out on a couple of good camera features opting for the 9 rather than the 9 Pro. The main camera on the 9 Pro offers optical image stabilization, which isn’t included on the 9, and is useful for its ability to keep subjects looking sharp in lower light conditions. There’s also no telephoto lens — just digital zoom, which isn’t as good as the 9 Pro’s optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The OnePlus 9 also doesn’t work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. (It works on both T-Mobile and Verizon’s 5G networks, however.) That’s no great loss right now (honestly, it might be for the better), but in a couple of years, this will probably become a downside. Bearing this in mind and a couple of camera feature omissions, the OnePlus 9 is an excellent device. It offers a flagship feel and performance for a bit less than the highest-end Android options and a seriously good ultrawide camera for wide-angle photo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best cheap phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4WMzav"&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A 5G starts at $500 and gets you access to several key features: a big-ish 6.2-inch screen, clean and uncluttered Android software, Google’s excellent Pixel camera, and of course 5G. Although buying a phone &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to get 5G is a mistake, all things being equal, it’s worth getting 5G if you can in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwyHDO"&gt;Even though the Pixel camera isn’t the very best you can get anymore, it still is competitive with phones that cost hundreds of dollars more. No other phone at this $500 ($600 on Verizon) price point can match the Pixel’s camera quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YRQbD"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a good-looking OLED screen. Just as importantly, it has the promise of getting timely software updates directly from Google. While other Android phones take forever to get the new versions of Android, Google’s get them right away.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGSyayDrR2mXPWMiM9i0d_4YCk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691996/vpavic_200728_4113_0127.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 2 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. Since it debuted for $2,000, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364162/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-price-cut-announced-1800"&gt;permanently marked down by $200&lt;/a&gt;, but you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will allow Parler to return to the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration Parler logo seen displayed on a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JBRQcUQHCNj_BwKg8Y6xElLaxkI=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150197/1232034190.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ulNwuE"&gt;Apple will allow Parler to return to its App Store, according to a letter first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/tech/apple-parler-app-store/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN &lt;/em&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TiBRO"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721?s=20"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), Apple said “Parler has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices” that would bring the app into compliance with the App Store’s rules. Now, Parler is allowed to return once it reintroduces the app to the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="59NFOy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On March 31, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SenMikeLee&lt;/a&gt; and I sent a letter demanding answers about why Apple removed Parler from the App Store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Today, we received a response: Parler will be reinstated on the App Store. Huge win for free speech. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FQBDSSSFGk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FQBDSSSFGk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Congressman Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JKLUfI"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed Parler, a conservative-favored social media app, following accusations that users of the app promoted violence ahead of and after a pro-Trump mob attacked the US Capitol. Before its ban, Apple demanded that Parler remove hateful and violent content from the app within 24 hours in order to remain on the App Store. Parler did not propose any changes, and so it was removed on January 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLzN3z"&gt;Days later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon dropped Parler, too&lt;/a&gt;, citing similar threats of violence. In doing so, Amazon effectively took Parler entirely offline until the site could find a replacement web host. Following Parler’s shutdown, the company’s CEO John Matze &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/973083119/former-parler-ceo-matze-stripped-of-all-company-shares-upon-firing-sources-say"&gt;was fired&lt;/a&gt; from the company and later stripped of all his shares. Parler found a new web host and went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284036/parler-social-network-relaunch-new-hosting"&gt;back online&lt;/a&gt; in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAOjEP"&gt;Apple’s decision to bring back Parler comes just days &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376127/apple-senate-judiciary-hearing-klobuchar-app-store-google-play-antitrust"&gt;before the company&lt;/a&gt; is set to testify before Congress regarding its App Store practices. Google will also be sending a witness to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378697/apple-witness-senate-judiciary-hearing-antitrust-app-stores"&gt;testify at the hearing&lt;/a&gt; scheduled for Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Six months later, there still isn’t a MagSafe car charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with Magsafe in a Ford F-150" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2eqHThjfDJiN9ysmOQseSCaGoPY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137951/DSC_9416.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See, it’s held on with magnets.&lt;/em&gt; | Nilay Patel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A review of the Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with MagSafe, which is not a charger&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5BoG1g"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; listeners know, I am a sucker for car phone mounts and chargers. They are a perfect gadget for the modern age — a design problem with no perfect solution, price points that usually land at the higher end of the impulse-buy zone, and completely well-suited for targeted Instagram ads. “People who have bought a Qi-based car mount in the last year,” the marketing director of a tiny accessory company sternly instructs the Facebook ad-targeting system. “Find them and relentlessly pressure them into buying our product which is at best marginally better than the one they have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wxGA1"&gt;Reader, it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d11VAF"&gt;All of this means I was very excited when Apple added MagSafe charging to the new iPhone 12 line. A series of magnets aligns a wireless charger to the back of the phone, and has enough attachment strength to — yes — hold the phone on a car mount. A dream: you get in the car, seamlessly &lt;em&gt;dink!&lt;/em&gt; your phone onto the mount, and drive away, laughing at the suckers fumbling with their cradles and motorized friction arms and other unwieldy ideas. &lt;em&gt;Magnets&lt;/em&gt;, baby. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do they work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with Magsafe in a Ford F-150" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jE4C1x2hBm0nsmPwyzBlmTNRPH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448963/DSC_9421.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nilay Patel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe attachment plate can pivot independently from the mount&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with Magsafe in a Ford F-150" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q4Hb9wFPRXxh4BodqkSuHOt9rWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448960/DSC_9412.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nilay Patel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note the lack of a USB cable plugged in here, because there isn’t a charger in there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezba14"&gt;Unfortunately it has been six months since the iPhone 12 was announced, and there is a pitiful shortage of MagSafe car chargers. In fact, there are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; officially-sanctioned MagSafe car chargers. Instead, there is this Belkin Car Vent Mount PRO with MagSafe, which, as the name suggests, allows you to mount a phone to your vents with MagSafe, in, um, a professional way. However, it does not charge your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9hVT9"&gt;I have been using a review unit of the Belkin Car Vent Mount PRO with MagSafe, or BCVMPwM, for a couple months now. It is at once supremely satisfying — &lt;em&gt;dink! &lt;/em&gt;— and also tremendously frustrating. Like all vent mounts, the weight of the phone is enough to pull the vent louvers down over time, especially if you have a large phone like my iPhone 12 Pro Max. The magnets are indeed strong enough to hold even that phone in place, but if you go over any particularly huge bumps, something will fall down — the phone off the mount, or the mount off the vent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mFB16"&gt;“Dammit, BCVMPwM,” you will yell, using the full name of this $40 promise to yourself. “Why aren’t you everything I hoped and dreamed of when I looked at the marketing photos on social media?” Then you will put everything back into place at the next stop light, sheepishly glance at your partner, and slowly realize they have completely stopped paying attention to these sorts of antics anymore. You need new antics. &lt;em&gt;You need to add Linux to your smart home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with Magsafe in a Ford F-150 with an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PE0Re-HiVifAlzQsY3fz1PDYaOg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448961/DSC_9414.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nilay Patel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a clean look, but note that this phone is not charging. Because it’s not a charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SkXxBZ"&gt;Stop it. Have I mentioned that the BCVMPwM does not have C? No, this is not a charger. For that, you still have to plug in a Lightning cable, which sort-of-maybe makes sense if your car does not have wireless CarPlay and you need to plug it in anyway — but there you are, plugging a cable into your phone, which is the complete opposite of the &lt;em&gt;dink!&lt;/em&gt; Magnet Experience. Your old car mount, with the horrible friction arms, had a built-in Qi charger. There are hacky wireless CarPlay adapters! People say they are kinda slow and have audio latency issues, but c’mon — a single &lt;em&gt;dink!&lt;/em&gt; to mount your phone, charge it, and instantly connect to CarPlay? Now that’s the good shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GCI6q6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10450154"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="0fkibY"&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; there an approved MagSafe car mount with built-in wireless charging after six months? Why do Apple accessory ecosystems always seem so petrified, in every sense of the word? This is the easiest win of all time, but instead, there is the BCVMPwM. It offers you a glimpse of a dream. Then it falls down. There are better unlicensed ones that might burn your car to the ground that you &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=magsafe+car+charger&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2"&gt;can buy on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It is the paradigmatic Apple accessory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXL8dh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8obgSq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music pays a penny per stream on average</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A woman wearing headphones and a mask" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEMkE3lC6O1SgypxlhXCPIbr9h4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137161/IMG_0626-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkhXC5"&gt;Apple Music’s payment rate for artists and labels is a penny per stream on average, according to a letter from the company posted on its artist dashboard, viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-reveals-how-much-it-pays-when-you-stream-a-song-11618579800?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;first reported by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (And now &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/16/apples-full-letter-to-artists-on-apple-music-streaming-payouts/"&gt;posted in full&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt;.) That payment rate is higher than Spotify, which has a confusing variable rate scheme that basically tops out at a half-penny per stream. Apple says in the letter that its rates vary by subscription plan and country but average to a penny-per-stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3MQls"&gt;Announcing an average penny-per-stream rate is a nice PR win for Apple Music, since it is 1. very simple and 2. Spotify hates talking about its per-stream payments, which the company insists are a misleading figure. Seriously, it just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336087/spotify-loud-clear-website-launch-pay-artists-streaming-royalities"&gt;launched an entire website&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/?question=spotify-pay-per-stream"&gt;Loud&amp;amp;Clear&lt;/a&gt; last month designed to help artists and fans understand how payments work, and a good chunk of it is devoted to explaining why per-stream rates are not the right thing to focus on. It’s a lot of copy like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="L4ZrlX"&gt;In the streaming era, fans do not pay per song and services do not pay per stream, so we don’t believe a “per stream rate” is a meaningful number to analyze. Still, we understand that artists find it useful to calculate an effective “per stream” rate or, in other words, a revenue-to-streams ratio — dividing the total size of the royalty pool on Spotify (&lt;strong&gt;the numerator&lt;/strong&gt;) by the total number of music streams on Spotify (&lt;strong&gt;the denominator&lt;/strong&gt;). Both of these numbers are growing incredibly quickly every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFeifM"&gt;There are a number of factors that contribute to that ratio looking small, which we understand can &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; problematic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OoYiht"&gt;Right. It is important to note that Spotify runs a massive ad-supported music service with very different economics to the paid Spotify Premium tier, while Apple Music only offers a paid service. And Spotify is way bigger, with 345 million total users, of which 155 million are paying Spotify Premium customers. (It’s hard to put good numbers on how big Apple Music is currently; the company’s last public number is “more than 60 million subscribers” from June 2019, and &lt;a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-music-statistics/"&gt;more recent estimates&lt;/a&gt; have it at 72 million.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRATzf"&gt;In any event, Spotify’s argument is that it pays lower variable rates on far more streams, while Apple’s happy to say that it pays a higher, simpler rate on fewer streams. Neither argument really solves the essential economic problem of streaming, which is that most artists can’t make a living on streaming royalties alone, which is why everyone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22375289/the-week-in-nfts-ranked"&gt;out there selling NFTs&lt;/a&gt; and hoping the concert business comes back in force soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gihfx6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: After viewing the letter from Apple to artists, this piece has been updated to note that the penny-per-stream rate is not a flat rate, but what Apple claims to pay on average.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQAVSU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lX9wT4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton clarifies the Apple Watch GymKit mess</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pelton Bike Plus in an apartment" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zjAdzAkjfcIwKZeco-myaiedaDE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69136950/akrales210108_4344_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5LoneU"&gt;Okay. Peloton sells a very famous stationary bicycle with streaming workouts, an app, and a whole fitness lifestyle situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g44yeN"&gt;Apple sells a very famous smartwatch with heart rate tracking, apps, and the ability to sync with fitness equipment over a proprietary Apple system called GymKit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znuAWI"&gt;The basic Peloton bike costs $1,895 and does not work with GymKit; the fancier Bike Plus, which works with GymKit, costs $2,495. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqXoLI"&gt;A lot of people bought the more expensive bike to use it with their Apple Watches over GymKit! And yesterday all those people were dismayed to learn that Peloton had disabled Apple Watch integration for “bike bootcamp” classes, which combine cycling with strength training. (The integration still works just fine with regular old cycling, but you understand, again, that Peloton is an entire fitness lifestyle situation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SLF7Dz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Peloton Bike Plus’ GymKit support no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385515/peloton-bike-plus-gymkit-apple-watch-bootcamp-support"},{"title":"Apple Fitness Plus adds new workouts designed specifically for pregnant, beginner, and older users ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/4/15/22385653/apple-fitness-plus-new-workouts-pregnant-beginner-older-users-jane-fonda"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4010wh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385515/peloton-bike-plus-gymkit-apple-watch-bootcamp-support"&gt;Peloton’s statement yesterday&lt;/a&gt; firmly pinned the blame for this on Apple, with a spokesperson telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that “Peloton is committed to bringing the GymKit integration to all workouts and disciplines &lt;strong&gt;within Apple’s terms of service&lt;/strong&gt;.” (emphasis ours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iM9b43"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s GymKit terms have a clause limiting them to specific use cases&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7uqkKp"&gt;This predictably led to a lot of confusion. Since Apple’s terms of service for GymKit are not public, it was not clear what terms Peloton had violated, and, in general, “using your expensive smartwatch to sync your heart rate to your expensive stationary bike” is not the sort of thing that should require contract negotiations between huge companies. And obviously Apple runs Apple Fitness Plus, which is a direct competitor to Peloton, and does not suffer from any corporate politics-based heart rate tracking issues. (And, of course, Peloton just &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/peloton-buys-wearables-ai-hardware-companies-in-deal-flurry"&gt;bought Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, which is... a smartwatch company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPtTzw"&gt;Anyhow, irritating the huge group of wealthy people who own both an Apple Watch and a Peloton Bike Plus is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pelotoncycle/comments/mrhhan/the_peloton_bike_plus_gymkit_support_no_longer/"&gt;a bad idea&lt;/a&gt;, so Peloton has a new statement today clarifying what’s going on. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mxD9SM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple GymKit is designed to work with equipment-based cardio workouts. However, Peloton recently implemented GymKit with Bike Bootcamp, a multi-disciplinary class type that combines strength and cardio, which the feature does not support. Members can still use GymKit to sync their cycling-only workouts to their Apple Watch from the Bike+.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="C3ZZUB"&gt;So basically, the Apple Watch does not support switching from biking to lifting weights all in one workout. Fair enough. That said, if people want to use their Apple Watch in goofy off-label ways, it’s weird that Apple is stopping them in this way, no? And certainly adding a “bike bootcamp” workout mode to the Apple Watch fitness app would be relatively easy for Apple, the company that makes the Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFB44x"&gt;In conclusion, Apple retains iron-fisted control over its devices and the things that connect to them through its secret accessory contracts, and if anyone would like to send me those contracts, our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/tip-us-secure-contact-email"&gt;Securedrop is working again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Apple’s ‘Spring Loaded’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Spring Loaded 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gI7IK3nwguOVMw1RNdWJEfYaVTk=/0x0:1770x1180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69136145/appleinvite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qIR5T4"&gt;Apple has officially announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22310826/apple-april-20th-event-date-rumors-ipad-pro-macbook-tv-airtags"&gt;“Spring Loaded” event&lt;/a&gt; for April 20th, its first major product announcement of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fs5b1a"&gt;Unlike a lot of Apple’s events, its spring events tend to be a bit more scattershot: one year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;might see high-end iPads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17155688/apple-event-2018-news-highlights-recap-ipad-education"&gt;another a more education-focused event&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18277461/apple-event-2019-tv-plus-arcade-credit-card-streaming-news-oprah-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt;launch of a comprehensive service strategy&lt;/a&gt;. This year, rumors are pointing to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;refreshed iPad Pro lineup&lt;/a&gt;, potentially with Apple’s first Mini LED panels — which would bring a big jump forward for the company’s tablet displays. But we could also see new AirPods, the company’s long-rumored AirTag trackers, a new iPad Mini, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6r3aba"&gt;The proceeding should kick off at 1PM ET on Tuesday, but if you’re looking for an early preview, here’s what you can probably expect to show up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HOEop9"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JxMxJQ"&gt;It’s been over a year since Apple’s last refresh of the iPad Pro, and the 2020 model — a fairly iterative update to the 2019 version — is starting to get a little long in the tooth, especially compared to the beefed-up specs on Apple’s latest iPhones and M1 Macs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGQQFx"&gt;Like last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;Apple is expected&lt;/a&gt; to launch both 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models; but the larger iPad Pro is expected to make a big switch in screen technology to debut Apple’s first Mini LED display. Additional rumors indicate that supply of the Mini LED panels might be hard to come by, that stock of the larger model may be limited at launch, or that Apple might delay the release of the 12.9-inch version until availability is better.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Brennan King / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zBZGKi"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sheds more light on what to expect, too: while the overall design of the two tablets is expected to stay largely the same as last year’s model, Apple is expected to swap out the A12Z chip for a newer processor that’s said to be on par with its more recent M1 chipset. The new iPads are also said to upgrade to a Thunderbolt port (with faster data speeds and a wider peripheral selection than the standard USB-C port) and feature upgraded cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT9yk6"&gt;Apple could also potentially have a new Apple Pencil accessory in the works to go with the new iPad Pros. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-design-rumor-image/"&gt;Images of a new, glossy version&lt;/a&gt; of the stylus have been circulating on Twitter, and the “spring forward” teaser could imply that Apple might offer a spring-loaded tip, similar to what &lt;a href="https://estore.wacom.com/en-US/stroke-pen-nibs-5-pack-for-intuos-4-5-us-ack20002.html"&gt;Wacom offers on its pens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="b9AGzS"&gt;AirTags&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OuBNThklNinnRQHDa5mQsEMF1OQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16318924/apple_tag.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/04/ios-13-tag-device/" target="_blank"&gt;Guilherme Rambo / 9to5Mac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w4SDSr"&gt;One of Apple’s worst-kept secrets in years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;Apple’s Tile-like AirTags&lt;/a&gt; have been rumored to make an appearance at nearly every Apple event and announcement since early 2019. Said to be small, circular tags with Bluetooth and ultra-wideband radio chips, AirTags would rely on Apple’s existing Find My app and network of iPhones, iPads, and Macs to allow users to track and find missing objects (similar to how users can currently track lost phones). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPwHRX"&gt;AirTags would also potentially work with recent iPhone models’ U1 chip to allow for AR-based ultra-wideband tracking in local areas — something that Samsung has recently also began to offer with its Galaxy SmartTag Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPigxw"&gt;There have been references to AirTags (or Apple Tags) in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841204/ios13-code-apple-tile-location-tracking-tag-find-my-app"&gt;iOS code leaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142249/apple-tags-iphone-kuo-location-tracking"&gt;endless rumors&lt;/a&gt;, and even in an official support video that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;explicitly revealed the “AirTags” name&lt;/a&gt; as part of its offline finding feature last year. The only thing left is for Apple to officially announce them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Lz4zxj"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hi8fI0"&gt;Also long overdue for an update is Apple’s oft-neglected iPad Mini, which was last refreshed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;over two years ago in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;. (Given that &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; update came after a four-year drought for the iPad Mini, a refresh this year would actually be beating par.) The current model features the exact outdated design that Apple’s been using for nearly a decade, with an older A12 processor to boot, so there’s plenty of room for Apple to improve things, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQqFtD"&gt;Adding fuel to the fire is that both &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo have pointed at a larger iPad Mini (potentially with an 8.5-inch display, which could come from eliminating some of the chunky 2012-era bezels) for 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hXZT6d"&gt;AirPods 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wAOlyD"&gt;A third-generation version of Apple’s AirPods has been rumored for months, set to feature shorter stems and replaceable ear tips, similar to the current AirPods Pro design. The updated AirPods are also said to feature better battery life than their predecessors. Apple has also been rumored to be working on a refreshed AirPods Pro design that would eliminate the earbud stem entirely, but as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’&lt;/em&gt;s report&lt;/a&gt; notes, that redesign is further out — so they’re unlikely to make an appearance here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ADfaBj"&gt;Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Avj54i8-cca5EZipGaQwJuZUvxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9289303/akrales_170919_1976_0104.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cnc8SQ"&gt;The Apple TV 4K sits at a strange place in Apple’s lineup. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;Released in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, it’s one of the oldest Apple products still being sold. At $180, its price has since been lapped by Roku, Amazon, and Google, all of which offer comparable 4K streaming boxes at a fraction of the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qgrpg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;Apple is rumored to be working&lt;/a&gt; on a refreshed model for 2021, which would add a faster processor and a new remote to replace the infamous Siri Remote. Support for HDMI 2.1 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;120Hz refresh rates&lt;/a&gt; could also be in the cards. But more than new features, the Apple TV 4K is in dire need of a price cut — something that Apple is historically more reticent to provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xc2tHL"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qWXCM9"&gt;Given the pace of both developer and public betas, it’s all but certain that Apple will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267230/apple-ios-14-5-watchos-7-4-public-beta-unlock-iphone-apple-watch-mask"&gt;officially release iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt; either at or immediately following the event (especially if it has new iPad hardware). The new software promises to add the ability to more easily unlock an iPhone while wearing a mask through an Apple Watch, new emoji, and Apple’s highly debated App Tracking Transparency feature that has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;drawn particular ire from Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HjrMZ1"&gt;MacBooks and iMacs and Mac Pros (oh my!)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n5xs2A"&gt;After the shockingly great debut of Apple’s first wave of Apple Silicon-powered computers last fall with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, Pro, and Mac Mini, all eyes are on Apple’s next steps in its ARM transition. The company is rumored to be working on plenty of new Macs as it looks to achieve its ambitious goal of switching fully from Intel’s chips within two years. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;more powerful MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; that would ditch the Touch Bar, bring back MagSafe and additional ports, and feature an improved M-series chip. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;A new iMac and a smaller Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; (also featuring M-series chips) are said to be in the works as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JT7aTR"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22320961/apple-wwdc-2021-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos"&gt;WWDC around the corner&lt;/a&gt;, though, it’s likely that we won’t hear more about new Mac hardware until then, especially if Apple is planning on debuting more developer and professional-friendly Apple Silicon-powered laptops and desktops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XyOxwb"&gt;Something surprising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2WK14k"&gt;Of course, with Apple, you never quite know what to expect — which means that there’s always room for a surprise announcement or two at the Spring Loaded event that not even we saw coming. Could Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959066/apple-augmented-reality-ar-headset-glasses-rumors-reported-release-date"&gt;tease its long-rumored VR headset&lt;/a&gt;? A refreshed iPhone SE? A first look at the Apple Car? Whatever happens, stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for all the details. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest you can grab a pair right now is for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/apple-airpods-pro-mwp22am-a-in-the-ear-bluetooth-headset-white/product_24422954?storeId=10001&amp;amp;AID=10921729&amp;amp;PID=4485850&amp;amp;SID=fa73db569d2011eb83a05281c35caba30INT&amp;amp;cvosrc=affiliate.cj.4485850&amp;amp;cvo_campaign=Coupon&amp;amp;cm_mmc=CJ-_-4485850-_-4485850-_-10921729&amp;amp;CID=AFF%3A4485850%3A4485850%3A10921729&amp;amp;CJPIXEL=CJPIXEL&amp;amp;cjevent=faa926699d2011eb824c01890a82b82a&amp;amp;dclid=CO2H2dLk_e8CFcmnnwod0Y4CCQ&amp;amp;userEnv=&amp;amp;tenantId=StaplesDotCom&amp;amp;locale=en-US&amp;amp;zipCode=21638&amp;amp;channel=WEB&amp;amp;encode=" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199 at Staples&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to celebrate Earth Day 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Earth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OozVLmUOe7lHQnZ6AK-ktjzpbJ4=/51x0:1049x665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69135860/earth.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xiTnsQ"&gt;Let’s face it, it’s been a long and hard year for the denizens of our planet since Earth Day’s 50th anniversary in 2020. However, it’s possible that things are looking up somewhat. Although the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging in many parts of the world, we do have vaccines that may eventually get us past this. And in the meantime, the Biden administration in DC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375827/white-house-biden-budget-request-100-million-air-quality-monitor"&gt;is putting environmental programs in place&lt;/a&gt; that may get the US back on track. So perhaps it’s worth doing a little partying (and educating) on behalf of this year’s annual celebration of the environmental movement, which is set for April 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kYWwy"&gt;Once again, most Earth Day celebrations will be virtual. What follows is a sampling of some that you can attend. For a more complete list, or to find Earth Day celebrations in your area, you can &lt;a href="https://earthday.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8d15cc3da12d4338a109c7d64c97c02a"&gt;use Earthday.org’s online tool&lt;/a&gt; for both online and on-site events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OrXJWS"&gt;Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8QW6v9NDXzAPuCqgHRYw78zARY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444064/earth_day_2021.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Earthday.org&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d5NL8Q"&gt;Earthday.org’s second annual “&lt;a href="https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2021/"&gt;Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth&lt;/a&gt;” online live stream event will be broadcast on April 22nd beginning at noon, parallel to the Biden administration’s global climate summit (see below). It will feature a variety of celebrities, politicians, and activists from many fields. It will be preceded by two events: on April 20th, there will be a global youth summit, and on April 21st, a global education summit. To take part, &lt;a href="https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2021/"&gt;visit Earthday.org&lt;/a&gt; on the day of the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="d0a4eY"&gt;Leaders Summit on Climate&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leaders Summit on Climate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CK9POWpOWKMDlBfZR167D915AWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444074/leaders_summit_on_climate.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: US Dept. of State&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaders Summit on Climate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjXXK"&gt;President Biden has invited 40 world leaders to a &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/leaders-summit-on-climate/"&gt;Leaders Summit on Climate&lt;/a&gt; which will take place April 22nd and 23rd. On the agenda are weighty questions, including how to reduce emissions, achieve net-zero (offsetting or reducing carbon dioxide emissions), and protect populations from climate change. You’ll be able to watch via a live stream link which will be available closer to the date of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cXPtVd"&gt;American Climate Leadership Summit (ACLS 2021)&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="American Climate Leadership Summit " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aB6u8wc6Pps7TkoQsIHgbUYYFKs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444080/ACLS.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ACLS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Climate Leadership Summit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8IMN0w"&gt;Another alternative to the Leaders Summit on Climate is the &lt;a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/ed5af75f-48ab-434f-8666-2d1854f7789c/summary"&gt;American Climate Leadership Summit&lt;/a&gt;, an online gathering of environmental activists happening April 27th - 29th. Sessions will offer information on the current status of climate change, strategies for activism, and other topics. It costs $25 to attend a single forum, $50 to attend the main session and a single forum, and $75 for access to the entire program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P9PVFn"&gt;Join a virtual march and rally&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SC1.5NCE NOT SILENCE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVObHSr1QrLmk9ome-59oc8M1hE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444084/gather_promo_site.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SC1.5NCE NOT SILENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cbXshH"&gt;Two organizations, &lt;a href="http://www.earthdayinitiative.org/"&gt;Earth Day Initiative (EDI)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://marchforsciencenyc.com/"&gt;March for Science NYC&lt;/a&gt;, are collaborating to offer a series of online events culminating in a virtual march and rally using an online gaming platform. On Sunday, April 18th, from noon to 8PM ET, there will be an online event with speakers and presentations from politicians, artists, and activists such as Elizabeth Warren, Kyra Sedgwick, Rosdely Ciprian, and Marc Yaggi, exploring a variety of environmental issues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GaFom"&gt;On Monday, April 19th, the virtual march and rally, called “SC1.5NCE NOT SILENCE,” will take place in a 1990s-like virtual reality space created by &lt;a href="https://www.futuremeetspresent.com/"&gt;Future Meets Present&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gather.town/"&gt;Gather&lt;/a&gt;. Through an avatar, you will be able to visit booths, speak to exhibitors and other attendees, and, at 3PM ET, take part in a march and rally organized by March for Science NYC and &lt;a href="https://fridaysforfuture.org/"&gt;Fridays for Future&lt;/a&gt; (the movement co-founded by Greta Thunberg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga5lzp"&gt; You can attend by sending &lt;a href="http://www.earthdayinitiative.org/2021-events"&gt;an RSVP via the EDI site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Xtgzq2"&gt;Virtual 5K race&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtual 5K race&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PX5TwU"&gt;If you’re a runner or a walker, &lt;a href="https://secure.qgiv.com/event/2021weact5k/"&gt;WE ACT for Environmental Justice&lt;/a&gt; is holding a virtual 5K race, where participants will be encouraged to walk or run 5K during the week of Earth Day, April 17th through April 25th. So even if your normal exercise regime is a half-mile stroll, you can still take part. You can use the race to raise money for WE ACT — or not — but all registered participants are asked to donate either a set amount or an amount of their own choosing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fMNcty"&gt;Artivism for Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Artivism for Earth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z5Pvc3nJTLiknHH-69mWrz7Zwn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444097/activism_earth.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sTMBb6"&gt;The University of Utah is planning to present &lt;a href="https://artivism4earth.squarespace.com/"&gt;a series of online performance events&lt;/a&gt; on April 22nd, most taking place at the campus’ Natural History Museum of Utah. &lt;a href="https://artivism4earth.squarespace.com/schedule"&gt;The schedule will include&lt;/a&gt; a video mosaic, “four immersive performances, arranged under the classical elements: earth, air, water and fire,” a feature-length film exploring nature and humanity, a panel discussion, and a final program that features several different multimedia presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vf2kEI"&gt;The Year Earth Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gnf6gJ"&gt;If you’re a David Attenborough fan, you may want to catch his latest narrated special, &lt;em&gt;The Year Earth Changed&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary about how the global human lockdown affected the non-human inhabitants of Earth — often in a positive way. The film will debut on Apple TV Plus today, April 16th; you can watch the trailer &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XswV_yqPq28"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

You can join at the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/pages/article/earthdayeve"&gt;NatGeo website&lt;/a&gt; or at its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVm7bg6pXKo1Pr6k5kxG9A"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; — and afterward, continue with the music of &lt;a href="https://ninjatune.net/artist/jayda-g"&gt;Jayda G&lt;/a&gt; on the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@natgeo"&gt;TikTok channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s App Store hosted kiddie games with secret gambling dens inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0LZ9nJLSZ4OeSuHlIF-Xa1aNEo=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69134221/terrible_gambling_app.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2RhM0S"&gt;In popular culture, access to an illicit gambling den is as easy as stumbling into the right shop and saying the password — or greasing some palms. Apple’s App Store apparently has a real-life parallel: today, app developer Kosta Eleftheriou discovered a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; kiddie game that’s actually a front for gambling websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJWKDA"&gt;The secret password isn’t one you’d be likely to guess: you have to be in the right country —or pretend to be in the right country using a VPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtbSIV"&gt;But then, instead of launching an ugly monkey-flipping endless runner game filled with typos and bugs, the very same app launches a casino experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AjfMMO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; app pretends to be a silly platformer game for children 4+, but if I set my VPN to Turkey and relaunch it becomes an online casino that doesn’t even use Apple’s IAP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/crnOOF0pNi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/crnOOF0pNi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382750329972805633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqH4eB"&gt;The app, “&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1546731180"&gt;Jungle Runner 2k21&lt;/a&gt;,” has already disappeared from the App Store, presumably thanks to publicity from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-ios-game-secretly-turns-into-a-gambling-app-1846693222?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=gizmodo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/15/eleftheriou-turkish-casino-app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who each wrote about Eleftheriou’s finding earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHIgJH"&gt;It’s not the only one, though: the same developer, “Colin Malachi,” had another incredibly basic game on the App Store called “Magical Forest - Puzzle” that was also a front for gambling. I tried them both myself, and here’s some visual evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsE6EBjU55YPHvUqGouoXePJij0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22447520/gif_scam_apps.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UVzpHf"&gt;Here’s what Magical Forest looked like when you opened it from the United States:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JbJoJZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10449066"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X1sdmf"&gt;I accessed them from a VPN server in Turkey; While &lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball &lt;/em&gt;notes that users in other non-US countries like Italy also seem to have been able to access the gambling sites, I tried them with a number of other locations including Italy without success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmkf3F"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;the multi-million dollar App Store scams&lt;/a&gt; that Eleftheriou uncovered earlier this year, it’s not hard to see why Apple’s App Store review program might have missed these — they largely look like your typical shovelware if you don’t know the trick, with only a handful of tells... like the fact that Jungle Runner uses a Pastebin for its privacy policies:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WeQPxzwFu1dkZMM6kcelor3xFo8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22447552/pastebin_jungle_runner.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q46Ola"&gt;It’s not necessarily clear to me that they’d be violating very many of Apple’s App Store policies, either. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#gaming-gambling-and-lotteries"&gt;Gambling apps are permitted by Apple,&lt;/a&gt; as long as they’re geo-restricted to regions where that gambling is permitted by law, and you could maybe argue that’s exactly what this developer did by checking your IP address. But I imagine Cupertino would frown on a gambling app masquerading as a kid’s game either way — and Eleftheriou suggests the gambling sites may be scamming people out of money, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IlyJoT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As an icing on the cake, people in the reviews say that they deposited large sums for the promise of a bonus, but they never received the promised payouts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprising no one, the scammers aren’t even operating a fair casino.&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382750376978313226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JYkbVJ"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bplVAO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbKF23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVzh3I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYPFkP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mb2uTD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Spring Loaded event: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQfy_HJ-uLurWi5D4Bl4HGm8yKI=/34x0:1759x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69132951/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_8.22.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT on April 20th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="imUhUH"&gt;Spring has sprung and with it, the first Apple event of the year. The company successfully brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21552864/apple-event-macbook-arm-air-announcements-news-rumors-one-more-thing"&gt;custom Arm chips to its Macs&lt;/a&gt; last year, and now it’s continuing its product updates with an event called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22310826/apple-april-20th-event-date-rumors-ipad-pro-macbook-tv-airtags"&gt;Spring Loaded&lt;/a&gt;.” Outside the obvious coiled metal connotation, the name suggests another jam-packed day of announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2PTIT"&gt;And Apple does have a lot of products to address. The Apple TV was last updated in 2017 but is rumored to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;support for 120Hz displays&lt;/a&gt;, a new processor that could make it a more capable Apple Arcade machine, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a redesigned remote&lt;/a&gt;. The iPad mini is also expected to finally receive some love after sitting idle since 2019. Reports point to a larger display and updated internals for the small tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I22HdR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;New iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; will reportedly get a speed boost with a new chip similar to Apple’s M1, a Thunderbolt port for faster transfers and compatibility with more devices, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279247/apple-ipad-pro-2021-5g-qualcomm-mini-led-a14x"&gt;support for 5G&lt;/a&gt;. The larger 12.9-inch Pro may also be the first Apple device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;to feature a Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;a display and component shortage&lt;/a&gt; could limit how many tablets Apple is able to produce and sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvkD5I"&gt;There’s plenty of other hanging threads, too: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;the long-rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt; could show up, Apple may have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375738/apple-podcast-the-line-us-navy-spotify-original-shows"&gt;new podcast strategy&lt;/a&gt;, the Apple Pencil could get a redesign, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;new AirPods&lt;/a&gt; could make an appearance, the MacBook Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;might finally get its ports back&lt;/a&gt;, and there are always plenty of opportunities for surprises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlCEZQ"&gt;We’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here with everything Apple announces.&lt;/p&gt;
