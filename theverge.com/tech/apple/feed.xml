    <title>Apple AirPods Max first look: lots to prove</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max from above" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vpHqQubstLK_bgtpOF_Eff-1kao=/0x249:1000x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489888/npatel_201209_4332_0019sq.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;At $549, they need to deliver more than just good sound&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Xczc3j"&gt;I’ve been playing with Apple’s new $549 AirPods Max over-ear headphones since yesterday afternoon, and so far they sound very nice and fit very comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMlMIj"&gt;They also — I have to say this — have a distinct smell, like a funky riff on new-car smell. I am pretty sure that’s a byproduct of the memory foam earpads rolling off the manufacturing line and straight into a shipping box to my house, and I’m reliably told it will fade away over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5UCFZ"&gt;I would probably not tell you what a pair of $100 headphones smells like. But at $550, I feel compelled to note that the AirPods Max are a multisensory experience out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max headband" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-jJQLigb9MPDQnoYs35H51arBnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159216/npatel_201209_4332_0036.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2rVS8D"&gt;Design-wise, the AirPods Max are an interesting blend of classic only-Apple design flourishes and odd incongruities. The headband is stainless steel covered in white rubbery material, with a “breathable mesh knit canopy” across the top; Apple says this distributes the weight of the headphones more evenly across your head. (I can’t say it feels very much different than my Sony WH-1000M2s, but it’s possible I just have a very large head.) The headband connects to the earcups with adjustable stainless-steel extensions culminating in a pleasantly spring-loaded hinge, all of which is nicer than any other premium headphones I’ve used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max bottom" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcDSPV8w6-QPYFuGbVVpXtYrgBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159219/npatel_201209_4332_0033.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y45TJP"&gt;The fairly large earcups are where things get a little messier. I have the silver AirPods Max, and the vast expanse of flattish aluminum does not look at first glance like $550 — it’s possible the other colors look more premium, but you would be forgiven for thinking these are plastic until you touch them and feel the coldness of metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnrWIw"&gt;The earcups are not smooth, unbroken surfaces. There are 10 slots of various shapes and sizes cut into the earcup shells. Seven of those are microphones: six used for noise-cancellation and another for voice calls. (There are another two mics inside the earcups.) These slots are not symmetrical; the top of the left earcup has one long slot, one short one, and then three more slots on the bottom along with a long gray plastic antenna line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJh2zE"&gt;There are two slots on top of the right earcup, and there are three more on the bottom, in addition to a small status LED and the Lightning port, which Apple chose over USB-C to be more convenient for all the iPhone users out there. The AirPods Max can be charged to its full 20-hour battery life in two hours from the standard 5W iPhone brick, and run for 90 minutes after just five minutes on the charger. (There’s no fast-charging available, even if you use a USB-C to Lightning cable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max digital crown" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXA48ZX3DznrRvhOK_bRyXXMk14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159220/npatel_201209_4332_0029.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max digital crown compared to Apple Watch digital crown" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-MdApQafu_eT_aX8HAeMOhg3Fk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159327/npatel_201209_4332_0058.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmCN7U"&gt;The right earcup also has a button to switch between noise-cancelling and transparency mode, as well as a Digital Crown volume control you can press to play and pause music, and hold to invoke Siri. (You can also just say “Hey Siri,” which worked well enough.) One note on the crown: it’s much bigger than the one that appears on an Apple Watch, so it doesn’t feel too awkward to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHINMW"&gt;All of this is to say: there’s a lot going on visually with the AirPods Max, much more so than you’d expect from a pair of $550 Apple headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEs7cF"&gt;One thing you will not find: a 3.5mm or 2.5mm analog audio input, which is standard issue on noise-canceling headphones at this price point — that’s how you plug into an airplane seat-back entertainment system to watch the movie. Apple knows this is a common use case, because it is selling a $35 3.5mm-to-Lightning cable for exactly that purpose. That brings you to $585 for the AirPods Max, which is just $15 less than an entire iPhone 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEsjtRbdI_mi8xja_w72EzH2zyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159326/npatel_201209_4332_0060.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EZT5t8fkJEkWPnKf2xtfgq5ZUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159325/npatel_201209_4332_0063.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gs7QJy"&gt;The memory-foam earcups are very comfortable, and attach magnetically — they remain firmly in place, but come out easily when you need them to. Underneath, there’s white plastic, and a window for the sensor that detects your ears — the music automatically stops when you take the headphones off, or even just lift one earcup to talk to someone. The AirPods Max don’t have a power button, which is very Apple; they just go to sleep when they haven’t been on your head for a while, and then wake up when you put them back on. Clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfLJy784kh1AUCVTFVHU8pIrOkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159226/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The back of the AirPods Max case exposes where the material comes through itself and is glued in place.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwopur"&gt;I have no idea what’s going on with the AirPods Max case, which is a goofy one-piece contraption that’s folded and glued over on itself to form a case. It looks very much like a purse when wrapped around the headphones, which is at once fun and clever and also not the point of a headphones case that needs to survive in a backpack. It does not appear very protective, feels like it will get dirty fast, and generally does not hold a candle to the nice hard cases that come with almost every other set of premium headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfBRLU"&gt;It is one of the cheaper-feeling things Apple has ever made, in my estimation — the second in a trend that started with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;the MagSafe Duo Charger&lt;/a&gt;. I hope there is not a third thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdN0YCZxjqQakcK-QGhVd9SF1AY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159213/npatel_201209_4332_0043.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max case interior" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7M5FimbBvOA3OSPoBGM0Hpin6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159210/npatel_201209_4332_0047.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NT1X03"&gt;Sound-wise, I’ve had fun listening to the AirPods Max for a few hours — they’re crisp and bright, with a pleasingly wider soundstage than my Sony headphones, and no distortion at all, even at max volume. We’ll have a full review of these soon, including tests of spatial audio and Apple’s claim of Atmos surround sound support, so stay tuned for that. But for now, rest assured the AirPods Max sound more than good enough to compete with other high-end headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqKGEP"&gt;Of course, those competing headphones are all cheaper — much cheaper — than the AirPods Max. The newest Sony WH-MX1000M4s are regularly on sale for $300, sound very good, and have a 10-hour-longer battery life. The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are $339, also sound very good, and have brand cachet that’s known in first-class cabins the world over. (They also both have audio-in jacks for those seat-back entertainment systems.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PcYNBI"&gt;Whether Apple has actually done enough here to justify the staggering premium over the competition is an open question that it’ll take us a little more time reviewing to answer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MagSafe wallet now has competition that’s cheaper and packs more features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of an iPhone 12 Pro with the MOFT wallet" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krrV0MtswKY7cqpe-ssIASsuOF8=/0x181:1869x1427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489392/MOFT_X_MagSafe_Compatible_Blue_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: MOFT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v1Y4s6"&gt;MOFT is a company that’s made iPhone accessories in the past, and it’s now releasing a competitor to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHLT3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-saddle-brown%3Ffnode%3Dcd4158bd6fb3c664a3d8c1e0372c57a949246fc0923dca31434702ad4183a1e0fe0eb444a601d27d893d29cc7564166f1632fb24dc980401eba03a25a98db09f6a089fa7d1b8f04bbb039db4cade0792b2fdbe5776534ccb497cd035f2f4033c58f07f88108ecfffcc7f6dbe55c727d5%26fs%3Df%253Dwallet%2526fh%253D12b2bf%25252B4667&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22151212%2Fmagsafe-wallet-iphone-accessory-moft#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s $50 MagSafe wallet&lt;/a&gt;. MOFT’s version, &lt;a href="https://www.moft.us/pages/moft-snap-on-phone-stand-wallet-magsafe-compatible"&gt;which goes on sale today&lt;/a&gt;, costs only $30 and holds three cards like Apple’s, but it also has a built-in kickstand. The stand lets users keep their phone upright in portrait, landscape, or what the company is calling “float mode”, which you can see in the image below. It’s made of vegan leather, as opposed to Apple’s “European leather”, which makes it an option for people who don’t want to use animal-based products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of a phone attached to the case in landscape, portrait, and float mode. Float mode involves the case sitting vertically with the phone being held horizontally." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jyNwAg1chRL9BTWyq8Izxx3r8SA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22146306/Image_from_iOS.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: MOFT&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using magnets instead of adhesive makes the float mode possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gznwcB"&gt;This new accessory seems to be a tweaked version of &lt;a href="https://www.moft.us/products/moft-x"&gt;MOFT’s existing X Phone stand&lt;/a&gt;, except now it’s using the iPhone 12’s MagSafe system to attach to the phone instead of adhesive. This means you’ll be able to take it on and off whenever you want, without having to worry about wearing out glue. The company even touts that you can make a wallet-MagSafe charger-iPhone sandwich to prop up your phone while charging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Video of attaching the wallet to the back of a MagSafe charging puck and using it as a stand" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/92XDK8R473UcUz_C4w5myxvCvls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142683/GIF5.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: MOFT&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the wallet as a stand while charging your phone with the MagSafe charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="syeAg9"&gt;It also has magnets on both sides, meaning that you could also stick it to any magnetic metal surface (though if you want to stick it to a non-magnetic surface, MOFT will happily sell you their &lt;a href="https://www.moft.us/products/moft-magnetic-sticky-pads"&gt;magnetic sticky pads&lt;/a&gt; for $10, or include one with the case for an extra $5). This is something I’ve already found myself doing. For example, I’ve stuck my phone to the fridge while trying to talk to someone and cook at the same time (though I’d hope the MOFT case would stick better, as my phone slowly drops the longer I leave it on there).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Picture of a phone magnetically stuck to the side of a refrigerator" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wsw0e38z3MlEHM82rAl-3w9Wp9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142437/Fridge_phone.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technically this is something you can do with Apple’s MagSafe case, but it’s a bit perilous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FVO9oQ"&gt;The combo wallet/stand is one of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall-accessories%2Fmagsafe%3Fpage%3D1%26f%3Dwallet%26fh%3D12b2bf%252B4667&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22151212%2Fmagsafe-wallet-iphone-accessory-moft#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the few MagSafe-compatible accessories&lt;/a&gt; that have hit the market since&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21508028/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-homepod-mini-event-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt; Apple announced the iPhone 12 in mid-October&lt;/a&gt;, which seems curious as these products should be reasonably easy to make: you take your product and add magnets (oh, and probably some shielding if it’s a wallet). As the owner of a MagSafe-compatible phone, though, this isn’t the wallet for me. I’m just not able to squeeze down to only three cards. You may also want to check out &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-Ultra-Light-Invisible-Foldaway-Stand-Starry/dp/B07Z4QM4RD/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=moft&amp;amp;qid=1607023665&amp;amp;sr=8-8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Amazon reviews of MOFT’s existing case&lt;/a&gt; to see if the number of users reporting build-quality issues concerns you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN3JXg"&gt;If you’re looking for something that does even more than the Moft accessory, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/19/21522620/peak-design-mobile-phone-case-bike-car-mount-tripod-hands-on-kickstarter"&gt;Peak Design case/accessory system that’s currently being crowdfunded&lt;/a&gt; may be worth a &lt;s&gt;peak&lt;/s&gt; look (though it’s a much higher buy-in price than the MOFT). Whether you decide to wait for that, go with MOFT’s or Apple’s offerings, or do something else entirely, we probably agree that the introduction of magnets has made the future of the accessories for iPhones pretty interesting (as long as companies continue to come out with products).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former employees say Apple stood by while suppliers violated Chinese labor laws</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Factory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NZCyaMV3D9dfqcO6GRC5a2fbvMI=/18x0:693x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488393/apple-factory.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Factory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YdEiwP"&gt;Apple has been complicit in its suppliers’ violations of Chinese labor laws, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-turned-blind-eye-to-supplier-breaches-of-chinese-labor-laws?utm_campaign=%5Brtsu%5D+Automated+RTS&amp;amp;utm_content=1002702&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=cio&amp;amp;utm_term=1000266"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Suppliers have periodically filled their factories with temporary workers or “dispatch labor,” violating a Chinese labor law requiring no more than 10 percent of a factory’s workers be temporary employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rILLI"&gt;Much like in the US, temporary employees in China receive lower pay and fewer benefits, and they’ve become increasingly common as interest in factory jobs has shrunk according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources. The law limiting the use of dispatch labor came into effect in 2014, and that year Apple conducted a survey of its suppliers in China to determine how many already complied. The company found that among 362 factories, “nearly half were over the quota for temporary workers,” according to a presentation &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e75UuW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple took no major action against its suppliers for violating temp-worker labor laws&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lihBd2"&gt;Despite that figure, not much had changed by 2016 and the end of a grace period for complying. Three former members of Apple’s “supplier responsibility team” said that the company “took no major action against its suppliers for violating the temp-worker labor law out of concerns it would create costs, drain resources and delay product launches.” If the claims are true, it’s notable because Apple says it applies its supplier code of conduct policies equally across its supply chain, which should prevent these kinds of violations from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lAzcM"&gt;New data Apple collected in 2018 shows the problem continued. &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;says that a Quanta factory manufacturing Apple Watches hired 5,000 temporary workers to bring its workforce to 18,000. That’s around 27 percent temporary workers, above the 10 percent limit set by the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odzpaM"&gt;This isn’t the first time labor laws have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2012/2/8/2785448/foxconn-factory-working-conditions-company-responses"&gt;violated on Apple’s watch&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, Apple actually admitted to at least a portion of this dispatch labor problem in its &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-apple-foxconn-temporary-workers-china.html"&gt;dealings with Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. Foxconn had exceeded the 10 percent limit, despite previously agreeing multiple times to stop. And just last month another supplier, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556154/apple-supplier-pegatron-student-labor-violation"&gt;Pegatron, violated student labor laws&lt;/a&gt; and falsified its records to cover it up. Apple’s reported response was to put the company on “probation,” preventing it from conducting any new business with Apple until the problem was resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcEzRK"&gt;Despite the Pegatron example, punishments have still not been broadly applied.  Limits on temporary labor are an issue that all large tech companies manufacturing in China have likely been dealing with, but it’s Apple’s desire to “surprise and delight,” along with maintaining aggressive production quotas, that have potentially worsened the problem. In a quote from the report, an unnamed Apple executive admits as much: “We are making it difficult for our suppliers to comply with this law as 10% dispatch is simply not enough to cope with the spikes in labor demand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tK8zhr"&gt;Apple is aware this is an issue, but until it’s willing to step in and take bolder action, suppliers will take shortcuts to keep Apple’s business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s privacy labels are coming to all apps, including its own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5ROCKsp-0ZY7kaAJwf6endUcPM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68486285/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9NOW6I"&gt;Apple has clarified that its &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/"&gt;mandatory app privacy “nutrition labels”&lt;/a&gt; program will apply to all apps, whether they’re from third-party developers or Apple’s own. It’s an apparent response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;criticism from WhatsApp earlier today&lt;/a&gt; that the program unfairly favored Apple’s services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxSXLx"&gt;That means Apple’s apps on the App Store will receive similar privacy labels when the program rolls out later this year as third-party apps. And for the few iOS apps that aren’t available in the App Store — like Messages, a particular point of contention for WhatsApp — they will have the same privacy information available on Apple’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHNjJM"&gt;The statement follows a complaint from WhatsApp from earlier today in which the messaging service claimed that Apple’s system was unfair, as it would only impact third-party services but not Apple’s preinstalled apps. For its part, Apple had never announced any policy to indicate that its apps would be exempt from the privacy label requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s3ZRWC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All apps will get privacy labels&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L1C0P7"&gt;“We think labels should be consistent across first and third party apps as well as reflect the strong measures apps may take to protect people’s private information,” WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/whatsapp-apple-privacy-label-requirements-cc0d5edd-ab2f-4549-b9d7-ea3c97184056.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a statement earlier today. “While providing people with easy to read information is a good start, we believe it’s important people can compare these ‘privacy nutrition’ labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed, like iMessage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUG1Fg"&gt;Apple first introduced the privacy labels as part of its WWDC announcements earlier this year. The labels — likened to nutrition facts found on food products — will appear in the App Store and give users easy, glanceable breakdowns of the data that developers can collect and track. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551926/apple-privacy-developers-nutrition-labels-app-store-ios-14"&gt;Developers were required&lt;/a&gt; to start submitting labels for their apps starting on December 8th, and the labels themselves are expected to start appearing “&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/"&gt;later this year&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp criticizes Apple’s new app privacy labels over iMessage inconsistency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FdqPyA2heneUL-6ea89jj6hcKZI=/6x0:1086x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483603/verge-whatsapp-notification-2040pxl.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naXIJs"&gt;WhatsApp has hit back at Apple over its new privacy labels for apps in the App Store, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/whatsapp-apple-privacy-label-requirements-cc0d5edd-ab2f-4549-b9d7-ea3c97184056.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that it’s unfair that they don’t appear to cover the pre-installed first-party service iMessage, since it’s not available on the App Store. The Facebook-owned messaging service reportedly submitted its privacy label information to Apple on Monday, and it has &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/unpacking-whatsapps-privacy-label-in-the-apple-app-store"&gt;published an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; outlining what each label means in terms of the service’s data collection, and why it needs this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwfNul"&gt;“We think labels should be consistent across first and third party apps as well as reflect the strong measures apps may take to protect people’s private information,” WhatsApp told &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;in a statement. Although it said giving users easy-to-read privacy information is “a good start,” it added that “it’s important people can compare these ‘privacy nutrition’ labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed, like iMessage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5zpyb5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s important people can compare these ‘privacy nutrition’ labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq2mbX"&gt;Apple first announced the new privacy labels feature as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;host of new privacy features at WWDC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Likening them to the nutrition labels used on packaged groceries, the company said the feature should provide app users with more information about the data being collected on them. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#main:~:text=This%20information%20will%20be%20required%20to,App%20Store%20starting%20December%208%2C%202020"&gt;As of December 8th&lt;/a&gt;, developers are required to provide the information when submitting new apps and updates, however &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;notes that it’s unclear when they’ll start appearing on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0ogKE"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165959/apple-privacy-nutrition-labels-all-apps-preinstalled-messages-web"&gt;since clarified&lt;/a&gt; that its own apps will be offer similar labels when they roll out; those apps that aren’t in the App Store, like Messages, will provide privacy information in a similar format on Apple’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT7R75"&gt;Facebook has also been critical of other aspects of Apple’s privacy push this year, like its requirement that developers show a warning and ask for permission to collect a user’s Identification for Advertisers (IDFA) starting with iOS 14. This is an identifier which helps advertisers target their ads. In response, Facebook said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;would stop collecting IDFA information&lt;/a&gt; through its apps, in a move that would “severely impact” its ad network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYC5km"&gt;“This is not a change we want to make, but unfortunately Apple’s updates to iOS 14 have forced this decision,” Facebook said at the time, “We know this may severely impact publishers’ ability to monetize through Audience Network on iOS 14, and, despite our best efforts, may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14 in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFNAMf"&gt;Apple later announced that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delaying the launch of the privacy feature&lt;/a&gt; until “early next year” to allow developers to make the necessary changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAuMP3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 9th, 5:25pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has clarified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; that its own apps will also offer privacy labels in the App Store, with apps that aren’t available to download directly offering similar information on its website. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to buy Apple’s new AirPods Max headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CfiK42iNqsVMxlGzJ_eeS-Kmsqg=/0x0:980x653/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478037/apple_airpods_max_listening_experience_12082020_big_carousel.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXTBOA"&gt;After many months of rumors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;Apple officially announced the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;, its own over-the-ear, wireless, noise-canceling headphones. This is the first pair of noise-canceling headphones to feature the Apple logo. They cost $549 and are available for preorder now with shipping slated for December 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swfJ7i"&gt;Unlike the AirPods and AirPods Pro, the AirPods Max come in multiple colors (dark gray, silver, blue, green, and pink). They feature high-fidelity audio, adaptive EQ, active noise cancellation, and spatial audio. Apple says the headphones offer a 20-hour battery life with charging done through Apple’s Lightning connector and not through a USB-C cable. (No, a charging brick does not come in the box.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzaX5q"&gt;We’ll be reviewing the new wireless headphones soon, but if you are interested in placing an order ahead of time, below are the retailers that currently have product listings available.  Currently, you can preorder the AirPods Max at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airpods%2Fairpods-max%2Fspace-gray#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726003076182366997" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-max%2F-%2FA-82065675%3Fpreselect%3D54191104%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. We expect other retailers to put up listings soon and will update this article when they do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly hands over its self-driving car project to executive who oversees Siri</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/glZ7wc-hDgvDNKQytQeIpIp8uQk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68480486/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ddwq7I"&gt;“Siri, drive my car...” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLoCLe"&gt;Apple is shuffling its leadership that oversees its secretive self-driving car project, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/apple-shifts-leadership-of-self-driving-car-division-to-ai-chief?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The team’s engineers will now report to John Giannandrea, the company’s head of artificial intelligence, who also oversees voice-based digital assistant Siri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJGTz4"&gt;Giannandrea, Google’s former head of search and artificial intelligence, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17195076/google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-joining-apple-machine-learning-siri"&gt;joined Apple in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. His hire was seen as a huge get for Apple, which has struggled for years to make progress in fast-moving and increasingly important AI fields like computer vision and natural language processing. Giannandrea reports directly to CEO Tim Cook as the leader of machine learning and AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="txAEHk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not much is known about Apple’s so-called Project Titan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iCwL67"&gt;Not much is known about Apple’s so-called Project Titan. Unlike most of its competitors, the company has been frustratingly tight-lipped regarding the self-driving cars it’s testing in California. After beginning with the aim of developing a purpose-built self-driving car, the plans were later scaled back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/17/13303710/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-focus"&gt;just developing software&lt;/a&gt;, with Apple partnering with car manufacturers such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387214/apple-volkswagen-partnership-self-driving-cars-project-titan"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; to provide the hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdG6JF"&gt;There has also been legal drama. In 2019, an Apple employee who is a Chinese citizen was accused by the FBI of attempting to steal trade secrets related to the company’s autonomous car project. It was the second time the government has charged an Apple employee for trying to steal self-driving secrets in the last seven months. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195598/apple-project-titan-200-employees-dismissed"&gt;laid off about 200 employees from the project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOmsjX"&gt;In June 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;Apple acquired the struggling self-driving startup Drive.ai&lt;/a&gt;. Apple purchased the company’s assets, including its autonomous cars, and hired many of its engineers away from Drive.ai directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wotXIB"&gt;Earlier this year, Apple filed a report with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that showed the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21142685/california-dmv-self-driving-car-disengagement-report-data"&gt;seriously downgraded&lt;/a&gt; its public road testing in 2019. After driving nearly 80,000 miles in 2018, the company only logged 7,544 miles in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3lNzO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s new Circle View Wired Doorbell is the first to support HomeKit Secure Video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/37zrbrLX1IEHZRskLwbQfrO7-fc=/189x0:2292x1402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479647/Screen_Shot_2020_12_08_at_1.43.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgILyD"&gt;Logitech has quietly revealed a new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHPGS2VC%2FA%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163585%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Circle View Wired Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; camera today, which is notably the first consumer smart doorbell to support Apple’s recent HomeKit Secure Video standard. The new doorbell is available from both Apple and Logitech’s websites for $199.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68qgFf"&gt;Apple first debuted the HomeKit Secure Video standard in 2019, but it’s taken some time for developers to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fhome%2Faccessories%2F%23section-camera&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163585%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adopt the system&lt;/a&gt;. Logitech’s new Circle View Wired Doorbell is the first doorbell camera to offer it, at least on a consumer level (technically, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes, the Robin ProLine camera beat Logitech to the punch, although that product is designed for commercial customers rather than home installations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmT0TT"&gt;As for the camera itself, it’s designed to exclusively work with Apple’s HomeKit system (so no Alexa or Google Nest support). The Circle View Wired Doorbell offers a 160-degree DFOV from a 5-megapixel sensor that shoots 1200 x 1600 video in HDR. There’s also an integrated light strip for nighttime that can light up to show visitors up to six feet away, along with color night vision. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mvdHmgY56ZZ41DoXrj0u2vDRywc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154964/HPGS2_AV4.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5a5ClF"&gt;HomeKit Secure Video allows for Logitech to outsource most of the actual “security camera” side of things to Apple’s software, using the Apple Home app to notify users when visitors are outside. It also uses Apple’s iCloud service for streaming, storing, and sharing video recordings, and Apple TV or HomePod devices function as main processing hubs for determining when people or vehicles are outside and for running &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/face-recognition-iph04af43727/ios"&gt;Apple’s face recognition feature&lt;/a&gt; (based on your photo library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rF8jmU"&gt;The Circle View Wired Doorbell camera is available for $199.99 (with Logitech also offering a $299.99 bundle that includes home installation through its website). To take full advantage of the HomeKit functionality, though, customers will also need a HomePod mini, HomePod, iPad, or Apple TV to serve as a HomeKit hub, as well as an iCloud storage plan for saving videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe releases Arm version of Lightroom for Windows and macOS </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jfq2Uw1xX4tufNM_y3d5B5-asg0=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477312/adobelightroom.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JvwjHG"&gt;Adobe is releasing an Arm version of Lightroom for both macOS and Windows today. The latest version of Lightroom is now native for both Apple M1 systems and Qualcomm-powered Windows 10 devices. It’s debuting as a full release, rather than a beta version and Adobe is making it part of the regular Creative Suite installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyxEn8"&gt;While this native Arm version is the new version of Lightroom, if you’re a fan of the classic Lightroom then you’ll need to wait a little longer for Adobe to ship it. “We intend to ship Apple M1 native versions as soon as they are ready, so stay tuned,” &lt;a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/2020/12/08/december-photography-updates.html#gs.myqpo5"&gt;says Sharad Mangalick&lt;/a&gt;, a program manager on the photography team at Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bx1XYM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adobe has also released a beta version of Photoshop for Arm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PAXcCY"&gt;This latest update to Lightroom comes just weeks after Adobe shipped a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571070/adobe-photoshop-arm64-beta-windows-macos-m1"&gt;beta version of Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; that supports M1 Macs and Arm-based Windows PCs. As it’s still in beta, Photoshop is missing a number of key features, but today’s Lightroom release keeps all the features you’d expect on the desktop version. It has essentially been ported across to Arm, with all of its existing features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ko3huq"&gt;Adobe says it plans to keep optimizing for Arm and M1 devices in future releases, so we’ll likely see additional Creative Suite apps arrive with Arm support soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus will launch on December 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uimffs3n1OlBFnHAFiyTqKdDsGs=/58x0:1903x1230/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477295/Apple_fitness_plus_screens_appletv_ipadpro_applewatch_iphone11_09152020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ztT7Cb"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus — the company’s new workout program service — is set to launch on December 14th, the company announced today. The subscription service is set to cost $9.99 per month (or $79.99 per year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PptfBG"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus was announced earlier this year as Apple’s latest attempt to continue to bolster its subscription offers, and it will feature Peloton-style guided workouts that can be viewed on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, while utilizing an Apple Watch for tracking workout metrics as you go. The service will launch with 10 workout types: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), strength, yoga, dance, core, cycling, treadmill (for both running and walking), rowing, and “mindful cooldown.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ere22"&gt;According to the company, “many Fitness Plus workouts require no equipment at all or just a set of dumbbells,” while the more equipment-based cycling, treadmill, and rowing workouts should be doable with almost any bike, treadmill, or rowing machine that users have. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3nCisE5NIaOLbY2BlIf334-fixQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154260/Screen_Shot_2020_12_08_at_8.49.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X6ABVY"&gt;Like other popular workout services, Apple will offer a variety of trainers who will guide users through each workout (and, like Peloton, Apple is clearly hoping that the cult of personality that has sprung up around the trainers for the popular bike service will benefit its service, too. The company is already curating &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/applefitnessplus/"&gt;Instagram pages&lt;/a&gt; for each trainer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSumks"&gt;Notably, the Apple Watch metrics are so key to Apple Fitness Plus that you’ll be required to have one of Apple’s smartwatches (specifically, an Apple Watch Series 3 or newer) to use the service, along with an iPhone to configure and pair it. You’ll also be able to view the workouts on a larger screen using an iPad or Apple TV, should you own one, but they’re not mandatory like the Apple Watch and iPhone requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afUqck"&gt;Apple is looking to goose the start of Fitness Plus by offering customers who have bought an Apple Watch Series 3 (or newer) three free months of Fitness Plus, while existing Apple Watch users will be able to get a free one-month trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAjygA"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus, in addition to the standalone subscription, is also available as part of Apple’s top $29.95-per-month Apple One Premier plan, which includes Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, and 2TB of iCloud storage that can all be shared by up to six users. But even the regular Apple Fitness Plus plan (for $9.99 per month) includes Apple’s Family Sharing support, meaning that up to six family members can access the subscription for the same $9.99-per-month price.&lt;/p&gt;
