    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $34 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has knocked down its price to $199 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at Walmart, which as it for as low as $270 in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F168696232%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=AppleWatchDealsEvergreen04012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with 32GB of storage for $299 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for $480 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mythic Quest season 2 gets new trailer ahead of May 7th debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UqJZ5N_-cXY02F3JOI-g15llOhM=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113808/021921_Apple_Original_Mythic_Quest_Returns_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJ90Sj"&gt;Apple released a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXl6KtP9TFw"&gt;new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;’s second season&lt;/a&gt; on Monday ahead of its May 7th debut. The trailer doesn’t feature many specific plot points, though it looks like we’ll be seeing how Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) and Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao) work together on a new expansion now that they’re co-creative directors on the fictional game. Things between them seem good, at least at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9D9zCx"&gt;The trailer also features Snoop Dogg (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/13/10764666/xbox-live-down-snoop-dogg-playstation"&gt;who does play video games IRL&lt;/a&gt;), who asks Grimm where the game’s next expansion is. He also made an appearance in a motion-capture suit in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vHVknNT_Bmw"&gt;the season 2 teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt;, so here’s hoping he has a notable role of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D02Pd3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHVknNT_Bmw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkSIua"&gt;The comedy’s first season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv"&gt;was a surprise hit&lt;/a&gt; when it premiered last year. The creators also released a quarantine special last May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337148/quarantine-specials-parks-rec-30-rock-community"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest: Quarantine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was made entirely remotely and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/mythic-quest-quarantine-40-iphones-600k-charity-a-cast-crew-eager-keep-going-1295215"&gt;filmed with 40 iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. A standalone bonus episode about the crew returning to the offices &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/mythic-quest-bonus-episode-season-2-premiere-apple-tv-1234728249/"&gt;will premiere this Friday&lt;/a&gt; ahead of season 2.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flappy Bird clone hacked into playable macOS push notification</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07-hKgcJXAJlQCnfNrD3PxsoCD0=/151x0:2310x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112203/msedge_L9EISOzg3c.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video shows the game playable in a push notification.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Twitter / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Sardesai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJnCPF"&gt;In a new video, a developer has shown off a playable version of viral hit &lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt; running inside a macOS push notification. It’s the work of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913"&gt;Neil Sardesai&lt;/a&gt;, who previously &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/mac-pong-on-a-dock-icon-is-cute-as-hell"&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt; with a clip of &lt;em&gt;Pong&lt;/em&gt; running inside a macOS app icon. The hack has yet to receive a public release, but it’s still a neat proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIC5Ez"&gt;According to Sardesai, the feature works by loading a web version of the game &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380942741224484871"&gt;into the notification&lt;/a&gt;. This playable version is technically a browser-based clone of the original app &lt;a href="https://playcanv.as/p/2OlkUaxF/"&gt;made by Will Eastcott of PlayCanvas&lt;/a&gt;. Sardesai notes that the feature relies on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649830175932421"&gt;UserNotificationsUI framework&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by Apple with macOS Big Sur, though he says it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1381008674060177418"&gt;should also work on iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="enCvwY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did you know you can put a whole game inside of a push notification &lt;a href="https://t.co/LlMx2AjvHH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LlMx2AjvHH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Neil Sardesai (@neilsardesai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RoN6H7"&gt;Distracting notifications are bad enough when you’re trying to get some work done, but combining them with a playable version of an infamously addictive game is the final straw. Sardesai doesn’t appear to have released his work publicly for anyone to try out, which is probably a good thing for the sake of our sanity. After all, the last thing humanity needs right now is for our devices to be able to compel us to play several rounds of &lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt; with just a simple notification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxYSuF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt;’s addictive nature was cited by its developer as one of the reasons he removed it from the App Store after it became a hit in 2014. “It happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem,” Dong Nguyen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5400488/flappy-bird-pulled-because-it-became-addictive"&gt;said in an interview at the time&lt;/a&gt;. Although the original game is gone from the App Store, numerous clones have surfaced in its wake, including an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761627/flappy-royale-bird-fortnite-battle-mobile-gaming-developers"&gt;excellent battle royale version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly developing an Apple TV with a built-in camera and speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QnHWwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly developing a new TV accessory that combines elements of its Apple TV with a HomePod speaker and camera for video calls, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Apple is also said to be working on a smart speaker with a display, similar to Amazon’s Echo Show or Google’s Nest Hub. Development of both devices is said to be in its early stages, with plans subject to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekAI8e"&gt;The unannounced TV accessory would have the hardware to fulfill a variety of roles. As a TV accessory it could offer access to games and the streaming video services supported by Apple TV today; while its built-in speaker would likely be an upgrade over those found in most TV sets, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459521/roku-streambar-soundbar-compact-streaming-bluetooth-spotify-connect-tv-audio"&gt;Roku’s soundbars&lt;/a&gt;. It would also support HomePod features like music playback and Siri voice assistant controls, much like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637225/sonos-google-assistant-how-to-set-up-one-beam-home"&gt;Sonos Beam offers&lt;/a&gt; with Alexa and Google Assistant. Finally, the camera would let it serve as a video calling device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871173/facebook-portal-camera-price-release-date-availability"&gt;like a Facebook Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt; TV&lt;/a&gt;. It’s potentially a lot of functionality in a single Apple device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AbEOj6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A HomePod, Apple TV, and video conferencing device in one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JFsFd"&gt;The second device is a smart display similar to what competitors Amazon and Google already offer, combining features of an iPad and HomePod. Apple’s work on the device was previously &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats?sref=ExbtjcSG#lazy-img-370126915:~:text=It%20has%20also%20been%20developing%20new,such%20a%20launch%20isn%E2%80%99t%20imminent.%20Apple"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. Like the TV accessory, this device would also offer video chat features, but via its built-in screen rather than a connected TV. Apple is said to have explored using a robotic arm to rotate the display and track users, similar to Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454117/amazon-new-echo-show-10-alexa-smart-display-moving-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;2020 Echo Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0wj9z"&gt;While Apple’s existing smart home devices have focused on one or two key areas, the functionality offered by the two rumored devices would be much broader. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Apple merged its HomePod and Apple TV engineering groups in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BZsva"&gt;Apple’s smart home lineup could use a shot in the arm. The company hasn’t updated its Apple TV hardware lineup since 2017, and it recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;discontinued its high-end HomePod&lt;/a&gt; to focus on the more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt;. A hardware update for the Apple TV has been rumored &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;for several months now&lt;/a&gt;, and recently discovered code suggests it might include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;support for 120Hz refresh rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New iPad Pro still coming soon but supply could be short, says Bloomberg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NF4oZcxXgcM7MUhtj_s9N6d3a-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111526/akrales_181101_3064_0078.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3xqWDa"&gt;Apple’s next iPad Pro may face supply constraints at launch due to issues in production, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s suppliers are said to be having trouble with low manufacturing yields for the new Mini LED display rumored to be the key feature of the new 12.9-inch model; one manufacturer has reportedly paused production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Ae6O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373281/chip-shortage-apple-macbook-ipad-delay-nikkei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that iPad production had been delayed by a shortage of displays and display components, though the publication didn’t specify which models had been hit. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1381456421607202820"&gt;According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, the new iPad Pro lineup is still expected to be announced later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk6vNj"&gt;It’s possible, though, that the larger model may have a later shipping date. The smaller model reportedly won’t use the Mini LED display, but other upgrades across the line are said to include a faster processor similar in power to the M1 chip in Apple’s new Macs, as well as an upgraded USB-C port and better cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it will send a witness to Senate hearing on app stores after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxvfy5MYV2A2o2l-kYDwt8pylbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69109994/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjupRR"&gt;After several senators criticized the company, Apple said on Sunday it would send its chief compliance officer to an April 21st hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the office of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday demanding that the company send a representative to the hearing, saying Apple was refusing to participate. &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter&lt;/a&gt;, Klobuchar and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) say Apple “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for the hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,” the senators wrote in the letter. “We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWqPC"&gt;But on Sunday, Apple sent a letter to the senators saying it was “surprised” by their letter and that it had intended to participate, but simply sought a change in the date. “We have a deep respect for your role and process on these matters,” the letter reads, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-11/apple-makes-top-executive-available-at-senate-app-store-hearing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company will make Kyle Andeer— who Apple says has represented the company before the US House of Representatives and several states—available on April 21st. “We look forward to sharing our perspective on our App Store,” the letter states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCfE13"&gt;Lee said in a joint statement with Klobuchar emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Sunday that he was glad Apple had “changed course and agreed to testify before the committee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3umhb"&gt;Klobuchar said in the statement the hearing will explore “whether Apple and Google are using their power as gatekeepers to charge high fees and impose restrictions that suppress competition in mobile applications and related markets, and both companies‘ participation in the hearing is necessary.” She added that the companies “have the power to control how and if mobile app developers can reach app users, and ultimately, which apps become successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSug3"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday. Its App Store practices, including the 30 percent fees it charges developers, have been under scrutiny from lawmakers in recent months. Apple also has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;battling with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; publisher Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, which sued the iPhone maker for what it claims are violations of antitrust law. That trial is slated to get underway May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvbzcQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UDXOY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 11th 5:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds statement from Sens. Klobuchar and Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5010ks"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0kWpia"&gt;Google is shutting down its mobile Shopping apps for both iOS and Android and directing users to its web Shopping site instead, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/google-shopping-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported. On Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-shopping-app-being-killed-off/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xda Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the term “sunset” had been added to several strings of code in the Shopping app, suggesting the apps were being discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxSVpZ"&gt;A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt; that the apps will continue to function through June. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Within the next few weeks, we’ll no longer be supporting the Shopping app. All of the functionality the app offered users is available on the Shopping tab,” the spokesperson said. We’ll continue building features within the Shopping tab and other Google surfaces, including the Google app.” The &lt;a href="http://shopping.google.com"&gt;shopping.google.com&lt;/a&gt; site will remain active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2C0bS3"&gt;The app allowed users to choose from among thousands of online stores and make purchases using their Google accounts. to quickly shop across thousands of stores and purchase stuff using your Google Account. This user found the Android app to be working normally on Sunday, but some users were already seeing a “something went wrong” message when they tried to use the Shopping app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3lA23j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;RIP Google Shopping's mobile app. Google is preparing to sunset it.

    <title>Epic antitrust case versus Apple in Australia gets three-month stay </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGTM665yR__G3wga7bj27k3Pf-Y=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106057/apple_fortnite_1984_parody.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qF227E"&gt;An Australian judge has ruled that Epic’s lawsuit against Apple in Australia will be temporarily suspended as the two sides prepare for a trial in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/04/epic-vs-apple-australia-court-case-temporarily-suspended/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo Australia&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/03/apple-tried-to-kill-epics-australian-fortnite-lawsuit-this-week/"&gt;asked for a permanent stay&lt;/a&gt; of the case in Australia, arguing that the US and Australia cases were very similar, and that the matter should be settled in the original jurisdiction of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umZUrn"&gt;The two companies are fighting over Epic’s battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite, &lt;/em&gt;and the fees Apple charges&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; In August, Epic set up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;own in-game payments system,&lt;/a&gt; effectively circumventing Apple’s App Store payments and avoiding the 30 percent surcharge Apple collects on App Store purchases. Apple then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from its iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; for violating its rules. Epic fired back with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;antitrust lawsuit seeking to establish Apple’s App Store as a monopoly&lt;/a&gt; and tried to rally &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367924/watch-epic-nineteen-eighty-fortnite-short-apple-app-store-ban"&gt;protest video&lt;/a&gt; mocking Apple’s iconic “1984” ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6PyAm"&gt;In November, Epic filed a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-legal-proceedings-against-google-in-australia"&gt;similar legal claim&lt;/a&gt; against Apple in Australia, saying the iPhone maker’s conduct was “unconscionable, and breaches the Australian Consumer Law as well as various sections of the Competition and Consumer Act [of] 2010.” Epic has also filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323100/epic-google-australia-legal-claim-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;similar claims against Google&lt;/a&gt; and its mobile app store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLQHTl"&gt;Australian Judge Nye Perram ordered Friday that the case in that country be temporarily stayed for three months. He also said the proceedings will continue to be suspended in Australia if Epic continues to pursue its case in the US, but could bring the case back to Australian courts depending on the outcome in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clF5lN"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Apple and Epic filed proposed findings of fact documents&lt;/a&gt; for the US court case, which is set to open in California on May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnLt5y"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Saturday, an Epic spokesperson said the company “remained committed to our fight for increased competition on digital platforms in Australia and around the world,” adding that the company planned to “continue supporting the Australian government and regulators in their pursuit of fair competition in mobile app marketplaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Pnu3O"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SXbDJy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite vs. Apple and Google: everything you need to know about Epic’s mobile app stores fight","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="whZUWB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV4Ypo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: April 10th, 2:22PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Epic spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple refuses request to testify for Senate app store hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4ilqchlztE6YxiGVW2_jo2uWy8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103463/acastro_190322_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee leaders are demanding that Apple provide a witness for an upcoming hearing on app stores and digital competition after the iPhone manufacturer has refused to participate, according to a new letter to the company released Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imbRdT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter addressed&lt;/a&gt; to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) say the company “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for an April hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RT3z2o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8h7rdt"&gt;“Apple has been aware for weeks that the Subcommittee was planning a hearing on this topic and was engaged in discussions with our staff regarding who would testify on Apple’s behalf,” the senators wrote to Apple Friday. “Yet a little more than two weeks [16 days] before the planned hearing, Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness to testify at a hearing in April.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhNpZ6"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSug3"&gt;Apple’s App Store practices have been under intense scrutiny by lawmakers over the last year. In 2019, the House Judiciary Committee launched an investigation into competition in the tech industry, including Apple’s App Store. Throughout the probe, lawmakers homed in on the 30 percent fees Apple charges app developers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;interview last June&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman David Cicilline (D-RI) called the practice “highway robbery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvbzcQ"&gt;The criticism extends to the app developers themselves. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;publisher Epic Games sued Apple last year, accusing the company of violating US antitrust laws after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;removed the popular battle royale&lt;/a&gt; game from the App Store. The trial is set to begin on May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,” the senators wrote. “We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elx5N3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
