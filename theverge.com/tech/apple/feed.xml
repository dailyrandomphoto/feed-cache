    <title>Apple surpasses $100 billion in quarterly revenue for first time in its history</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IRJ132"&gt;Apple today reported its fiscal Q1 2021 earnings, which cover the final calendar quarter of 2020 and the holiday sales season. That means this is the first time we’re getting a real indication of how the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; are faring with consumers. As it turns out, they’re doing very well. Apple crossed $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the company’s history: it brought in $111.4 billion in total, with earnings per share of $1.68. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfT7Kw"&gt;The latest iPhones went on sale a bit later than normal, and Apple has had to again close some of its retail locations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But despite those obstacles, the iPhone business did extraordinarily well, tallying over $65 billion in revenue. The previous all-time record for iPhone revenue in a quarter was $61.58 billion, which Apple hit in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SBoIW"&gt;Alongside a tweaked, flatter design, the iPhone 12 series is the first to include 5G mobile data, which some have speculated could result in a so-called “super cycle” of upgrades from people who are still using iPhones that are a couple years old at this point. The strong early interest is certainly there; now we’ll have to see if it holds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l89BnE"&gt;Apple’s Mac and iPad lines have seen rocketing sales during the prolonged period of working at home and remote education as a result of the pandemic. The momentum continued in this latest quarter, with iPad sales up a staggering 41 percent — during a holiday quarter, remember — and Mac sales up 21 percent year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uU0ZELodKHp9OMSCN3xNlwzpPww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21975638/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPad sales were up a staggering 41 percent year over year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AMFjtu"&gt;The company’s MacBook Air, base-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini are now powered by its own M1 processors. Those three products officially kicked off a transition away from Intel chips that will extend to Apple’s other Mac products over the coming months. The popular iPad Air was also updated in the fall with a more modern design similar to the iPad Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwYsfe"&gt;Unsurprisingly, AirPods / AirPods Pro and the Apple Watch were a holiday hit for another year running, boosting the wearables division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMrAuy"&gt;Just as 2020 came to a close, Apple launched its latest paid subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174574/apple-fitness-plus-watch-iphone-release-date-price"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which joins Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, and Apple News Plus as ways of getting recurring profits from consumers who buy Apple hardware. The company has continued to extend the trial periods for some of those services — namely, Apple TV Plus — but the services unit as a whole continues to perform very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoLcF"&gt;Executive shifts at the company also continue. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249393/apple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new"&gt;Just this week, Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that longtime hardware engineering SVP Dan Riccio will now focus on a new, unspecified project; John Ternus — who has publicly introduced well-received products like the revamped Mac Pro, iPad Pro, and M1 Macs — has replaced him as Apple’s hardware boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZjbN2"&gt;The company has also pushed forward with its social initiatives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228580/apple-detroit-developer-academy-equity-center-hbcu-tech-hub"&gt;announcing a number of racial equity investments&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;removed conservative social media app Parler&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store, citing insufficient moderation policies and calls to violence from some users on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mwaapw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is bringing iCloud Keychain support to Chrome for Windows, but it’s not ready yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of the iCloud for Windows screen, with the new Passwords option" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-nIWteYCLVk6VBGmLagEqcjXcU=/0x16:732x504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729981/IMAGE_2021_01_27_11_57_45.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gUsvQp"&gt;Users caught between Apple and Microsoft may now have an easier time managing passwords: it looks like iCloud Keychain is coming to Windows 10 as a Chrome extension (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/icloud-windows-chrome-extension-icloud-passwords"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It’s already in the iCloud for Windows 10 app, but there’s just one small problem: the Chrome Extension isn’t available yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSTGnx"&gt;The latest version of iCloud for Windows 10 includes “Support for iCloud Passwords Chrome Extension” in the list of new features, and when you open the app, there’s a new Passwords-syncing option. Checking the box will cause a login prompt to come up, along with a request for two-factor authentication. According to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201391"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need to have two-factor turned on for your account to have access to the feature, which is probably a good choice since, in theory, you’re going to be syncing all of your passwords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gTH8R"&gt;I say “in theory” because after you log in again, you’re prompted to download the iCloud Passwords extension for Chrome. However, the download button just takes you to a 404 page, and searching the Chrome Web Store for the extension doesn’t turn up anything. It seems like Apple may have launched the iCloud for Windows update a little prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows dialog box informing the user that they have to download the iCloud Passwords extension" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BMA4uLh9mA_9pJ19FkITpZYUm2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263750/2021_01_27_11_24_39_iCloud.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Google 404 page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cub8Mt4bQ5UiDkS2QUy4DPaJXyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263749/2021_01_27_11_29_56_Error_404__Not_Found___1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not the extension I was promised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IVMwWE"&gt;Hopefully the Chrome extension will be available soon, as having access to iCloud Keychain on Windows would make life a lot easier for people who use it on their iPhones, iPads, or Macs. However, if you simply can’t wait, you could always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to"&gt;switch to a dedicated password manager&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, moving all of your passwords would be a pain if you’re already using iCloud Keychain, so you may be better off just waiting a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly set to mass-produce iPads outside China for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air has the same design and shape as the 11-inch iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-mG4Gqfj0mgvSL3FDZ1f4Jlh5ps=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728363/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdXg9Z"&gt;Apple could start manufacturing iPads in Vietnam by the middle of this year, marking the first time a “significant number” of the tablets would be produced outside of China, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Apple-ramps-up-iPhone-and-iPad-output-shift-to-India-and-Vietnam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. As well as shifting iPad production, Apple is also reportedly increasing the number of iPhones manufactured in India, where it’s produced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/25/21338436/apple-iphone11-india-foxconn-china"&gt;some iPhone 11 units since last year&lt;/a&gt;. It will reportedly begin producing iPhone 12 series devices in the country as early as this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmOQ39"&gt;The report paints a picture of a company that’s increasingly keen to diversify its manufacturing out of China, despite hopes that trade tensions could ease under President Biden. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; notes that the new administration has said it won’t immediately ease tariffs on Chinese imports, and there are also other factors like rising labor costs in China prompting Apple and other companies to look for alternative manufacturing hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QOARp4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More audio products could be produced in Vietnam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2I76A"&gt;Beyond iPhones and iPads, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports that Apple is ramping up manufacturing of a host of other devices outside of China. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266574/apple-airpods-pro-vietnam-china-chinese-manufacturing"&gt;reports last year&lt;/a&gt; that Apple moved some AirPods Pro manufacturing to Vietnam, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says it’s also planning on expanding HomePod mini production in the country and will also move some MacBook production. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721353/apple-ipad-macbook-foxconn-manufacturing-vietnam-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported on Apple’s early plans&lt;/a&gt; to shift MacBook and iPad production to Vietnam last year.) Some Mac mini production has also been moved to Malaysia, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3rXzF"&gt;News of Apple’s shifting supply chains comes a little under two years after reports emerged that Apple was planning to move between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691132/apple-china-manufacturing-diversify-india-vietnam-trade-war-tariffs"&gt;15 and 30 percent of its manufacturing out of China&lt;/a&gt;. It now appears much of that shift is well underway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new iPhone update fixes security bugs, so it’s best to install it ASAP</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iMYjopuc0o5bZ3DZ5HzEUJPY_ZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724827/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmkq7k"&gt;Apple just released iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146"&gt;the update notes&lt;/a&gt; contain some worrying language (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Under kernel updates, Apple notes that “a malicious application may be able to elevate privileges,” and under WebKit updates, it says “a remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution.” After both statements, the update notes say, “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCPp57"&gt;What this means, broadly, is that you should update your iOS devices as soon as possible. To put the language into plain terms: Apple found a security hole in its operating systems, and it also has evidence that someone may have exploited it. The update notes don’t have any further details, so for now, we don’t know who may have used the security breach or what they may have been using it for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X02zGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not time for cyber-lockdown, but it is time to update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWXa7u"&gt;However it was used, the security breaches aren’t minor ones. An application being able to elevate privileges means that it could do things it’s not supposed to be able to do. Again, there aren’t any details, but broadly speaking, it means a malicious app could’ve bypassed some of Apple’s security protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RlwXb"&gt;The WebKit exploit isn’t better. A remote attacker being able to cause arbitrary code execution means an attacker could do things on your phone just from you visiting a website they control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nFOBQ"&gt;This isn’t to say it’s time to go into total cyber-lockdown mode, but it does mean that 14.4 isn’t an update you want to put off for a while. In the meantime, Apple says it’ll provide additional details soon, so we’ll keep an eye out for more information about the exploits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tweetbot 6 brings essential updates and a monthly subscription to the iPhone’s best Twitter app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqMbUIokFDhxVQu7cRbqDIasj7I=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724797/tweetbot.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PiOYrW"&gt;Tweetbot has long been one of the best third-party Twitter applications around for the iPhone and Mac, and today sees the launch of the latest version for iOS: &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834"&gt;Tweetbot 6&lt;/a&gt;, which converts the app into a paid subscription service instead of the single-time purchase that was previously offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul7"&gt;The new app makes the change to &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access"&gt;Twitter’s new API&lt;/a&gt; that the company introduced last summer, enabling some long-missing features in the premium Twitter app like Twitter cards and polls. That change does come with some trade-offs, though, including the removal of user-selected options for URL shortening, image uploads, and video uploads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0OcxaY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter launches new API as it tries to make amends with third-party developers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Rb0hGa"&gt;The free version of the app offers some basic functionality in allowing users to view Twitter — but you’ll have to pay for more substantial features, including the ability to send or reply to tweets, along with support for multiple accounts, push notifications, and “advanced filtering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgwxoH"&gt;Existing users may find the update to be a bit frustrating, given that Tweetbot 5 had previously been a single-time purchase for $4.99. At $0.99 per month (or a discounted $5.99 per year), the new app marks a price increase no matter how you look at things, while offering only a handful of new features to make up the difference. Furthermore, Tapbots will soon stop selling Tweetbot 5 on the App Store (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992"&gt;developer Paul Haddad&lt;/a&gt; says Apple made that a requirement to approve the new version), so new users soon won’t have the choice to buy the outdated older version for a single-time payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbLEJq"&gt;Tapbots does note on its website that the new version of Tweetbot 6 is an “early access” version of the app, with “many new features on our roadmap to be built as well as new API’s to adopt as Twitter makes them available,” so it’s possible that the new app will get further functionality over time that may ease the bitter pill of the pricer subscription change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRmNnI"&gt;The company also has yet to announce any upgrade plans for the Mac version of Tweetbot, which currently uses the older Twitter API and still costs $9.99 upfront to use. Including an updated macOS version of Tweetbot in that monthly or yearly subscription could also help add value to the new subscription, a strategy that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21109700/fantastical-flexibits-subscription-service-premium-price-apple"&gt;other apps like Fantastical&lt;/a&gt; have employed in their own jumps from paid apps to ongoing subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The HomePod mini finally adds its long-promised ultra-wideband handoff feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KUkQeNCTORVzfKiKt_ZCG5ck70=/0x70:2400x1670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723965/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gYySHV"&gt;Apple has officially released iOS 14.4 and a matching update for its HomePod mini speaker, adding the long-promised ultra-wideband (UWB) handoff feature that will allow newer iPhones to more seamlessly transfer music, calls, and podcasts between the two devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2eY2ea"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple HomePod mini review: playing small ball","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A5Dljp"&gt;While both the original HomePod and the HomePod mini have supported handing off music for some time, the smaller device features a U1 ultra-wideband chip that promises to make it even easier to transfer content over from an iPhone 12 or iPhone 11 device. The new U1-enhanced functionality also adds additional features, including new visual and haptic feedback. The U1-based system also will give the option to show listening suggestions when you bring your phone close and display media controls on your iPhone without requiring you to unlock it first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcqyfR"&gt;The ultra-wideband handoff feature was originally showcased when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21432979/apple-homepod-mini-features-specs-price"&gt;HomePod mini was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t included with the original release. Instead, Apple promised that it would be available later in 2020 (a deadline that the company has slightly missed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvIuOt"&gt;To take advantage of the new update, you’ll need a HomePod mini that’s been updated to the latest software, along with a U1-equipped iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 device that’s running iOS 14.4. The original HomePod isn’t compatible with the new functionality, though, due to its lack of a U1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple execs discussed not ‘leaving money on the table’ when setting Apple TV subscription fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTVeQlKKKGmZdfkAYAHilJNHgk0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722856/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KBQY4h"&gt;In Apple and Epic’s ongoing court battle over App Store fees, one of the key sticking points has been Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21531873/epic-apple-fortnite-app-store-lawsuit"&gt;insistence on maintaining a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; as a cornerstone of the storefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkC3mF"&gt;But newly revealed &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20464232-apple-exhibit-b"&gt;Apple executive emails from the case&lt;/a&gt; show that the App Store rules that Apple flouts as essential to the fairness of the app economy were carefully negotiated into existence over time in a way that ensured Apple wasn’t “leaving money on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4w4jse"&gt;The emails date back to a 2011 discussion, which included Apple software and services leader Eddy Cue, around how Apple would handle subscription video applications on the Apple TV — an important conversation, given the rise in popularity of streaming services. And while the discussion doesn’t offer much insight on Apple’s existing 30 percent fee for the App Store, it does reveal how malleable those rules were when it came to maximizing profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRP3wH"&gt;The company examined a variety of options, including a 40 percent one-time cut, a 30 percent one-time cut, a 30 percent ongoing fee, or more individualized deals with services like the NBA and MLB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX3yid"&gt;One email in the thread breaks down the different forms of content partners that would be offering subscriptions on Apple TV. It muses on which partnerships would be fruitful to try to get a cut (like new streaming services) and which ones won’t (like “entrenched” cable and satellite companies).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHle-AJR8b0RE6LKcGd2N6UC2lk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260627/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.07.36_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lDBfdE"&gt;Apple’s team settled on the idea that any iTunes-based transactions or subscriptions should stick with the same 30 percent cut as the App Store. But there’s more discussion over how the company will handle referrals, where the Apple TV applications link out to a service’s website for customers to subscribe directly to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xM9m6i_UWcZYgJgw3MB4OnVDiMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260629/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.08.32_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J6Yb07"&gt;The thread then discusses how fees should work when Apple refers a new subscriber. Should the company insist on 30 percent of the initial subscription? 30 percent of the first year? Just insist that all subscription applications funnel subscribers through the App Store? Concerns are raised that Hulu Plus might not be able to afford that kind of cost. Cue responds that Apple should ask for 40 percent of the first year, but that it may need to work out a few deals first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdnLiY"&gt;One point of concern for Apple was structuring the new fees in such a way that they didn’t undermine the payment structure it set on the App Store. “I don’t want to do any deals where we get less than 30%. That is what it is on the app store and we can’t be making a different deal here. If that is not possible than I want a one-time bounty but we need to very careful here so this doesn’t spillover to the app store,” one exec wrote. (The emails are threaded such that it’s hard to tell who is replying to whom.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Cw0ALFI1PdfQ_VGLmANjLY2Jqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260628/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.08.01_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0jAV1"&gt;It’s important to remember that in 2011, the Apple TV didn’t actually have an App Store — just individual apps that Apple worked out partnerships with on a case-by-case basis. And the thread seems to emphasize the ad hoc nature of the platform development here: Apple doesn’t seem to come into this with any defined ideas of what it needs to make the platform succeed, just a vague goal of maximizing profit and shaping the rules for the platform to best achieve that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches limited-edition ‘Black Unity Collection’ Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N5TB_L4fUKGaUpDNooXD542-tBY=/0x0:1866x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721801/apple_watch_Black_Unity_Collection.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zgRt1T"&gt;Apple is launching &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fapple-celebrates-black-history-month%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22250242%2Fapple-watch-black-unity-collection-limited-edition#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a limited-edition Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; for Black History Month, with a unique watch band, new watchface, and some of the proceeds going toward civil rights organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHKEOw"&gt;The watch, part of a new Black Unity Collection of products, comes with a black, green, and red striped band and face, meant to reflect the Pan-African flag. It otherwise appears to be the standard aluminum version of the Apple Watch Series 6, with pricing starting at $399. The band will also be available separately for $49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HldCjl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple also plans to highlight Black artists, authors, and developers throughout its apps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnxlxE"&gt;The products will go on sale starting February 1st at Apple and Target. The band will remain on sale all year, but the watch as a whole will only be sold in February. It sounds as though the watchface will be available to anyone with an Apple Watch starting later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBACLi"&gt;Apple says it’ll be “supporting six global organizations” as part of this product launch, including the Black Lives Matter Support Fund, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, and European Network Against Racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvNgYc"&gt;In addition to the new watch edition, Apple announced a number of other initiatives for Black History Month this year. There’ll be a hub in the App Store highlighting Black-owned businesses and developers; Apple Music will get “curated playlists, essays, original videos” and other content highlighting Black artists; and Apple Maps is getting curated recommendations from EatOkra, which highlights Black-owned restaurants. Apple plans to curate stories focused on Black families and experiences in the Apple TV and Apple News apps and highlight Black authors in Apple Books and Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjpOed"&gt;Apple is among a number of tech giants that collectively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;pledged hundreds of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; toward racial equity initiatives. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287999/apple-racial-equity-justice-initiative-amount-cook-lisa-jackson"&gt;announced a $100 million fund&lt;/a&gt; in June 2020; earlier this month, Apple said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228580/apple-detroit-developer-academy-equity-center-hbcu-tech-hub"&gt;create a developer education center in Detroit&lt;/a&gt; and support a tech hub for historically Black colleges and universities in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has a new head of hardware engineering in latest executive shuffle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cDhkj1CFPULcfezeUfQ-BqTa6uc=/56x0:1904x1232/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719477/Apple_dan_riccio_begins_a_new_chapter_at_apple_Ternus_01252020_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;John Ternus, Apple’s new senior vice president of hardware engineering | Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NBEKW7"&gt;Apple’s hardware team is getting its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fdan-riccio-begins-a-new-chapter-at-apple%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;biggest shakeup&lt;/a&gt; in nearly a decade, as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fleadership%2Fdan-riccio%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dan Riccio&lt;/a&gt; — who served as the company’s senior vice president of hardware engineering since 2012 — transitions to “a new role” at the company. He’ll be replaced as Apple’s head hardware engineer by John Ternus, who led the hardware team designing the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, in addition to working on Apple’s M1 chips. Ternus has been vice president of hardware engineering at Apple since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to8wIv"&gt;The role of senior vice president of hardware engineering at Apple is a key one: the position reports directly to CEO Tim Cook and is responsible for leading the Mac, iPhone, iPad, and iPod engineering teams. Ternus’ new role will put him in charge of the company’s hardware efforts, much in the same way that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fleadership%2Fcraig-federighi%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Craig Federighi&lt;/a&gt; — Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering — runs the development of iOS and macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKhEUo"&gt;Riccio won’t be leaving Apple, though: he’ll be working on an unspecified “new project” for the company in a role directly reporting to Cook. “Next up, I’m looking forward to doing what I love most — focusing all my time and energy at Apple on creating something new and wonderful that I couldn’t be more excited about,” explains Riccio in Apple’s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8UdolxBHH9VEnHKDHAnyp9a23w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259288/Apple_dan_riccio_begins_a_new_chapter_at_apple_01252020_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan Riccio, Apple’s now-former SVP of hardware engineering.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g6eoId"&gt;If that language sounds familiar, it’s because it’s almost the exact same description that Apple provided for Riccio’s predecessor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/27/3272577/apple-bob-mansfield-dan-riccio-engineering"&gt;Bob Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;, when he stepped down as SVP of hardware engineering in 2012. Like Riccio, Mansfield transitioned to “work on future projects” in an unnamed role that reported directly to Cook — which &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/apple-shifts-leadership-of-self-driving-car-division-to-ai-chief"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; included leading Apple’s self-driving car team until December 2020, when Mansfield fully retired from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pND1HN"&gt;Apple’s future automotive ambitions are currently being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;led by artificial intelligence executive John Giannandrea&lt;/a&gt;. But following Mansfield’s departure, there would appear to be a vacancy in senior hardware engineers on that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19PYcm"&gt;Riccio’s move is the latest departure from Apple’s executive leadership team in recent years, following legendary product designer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/28/20986838/jony-ive-last-day-apple"&gt;Jony Ive&lt;/a&gt; (who stepped down to form his own design firm, LoveFrom, in November 2019) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354367/apple-phil-schiller-fellow-greg-joswiak-head-marketing-store-events"&gt;Phil Schiller&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, who was replaced by Greg Joswiak in 2020 as Schiller refocused on running the App Store and Apple Events. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="support watchOS 7" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-2TkUJkurmgX8ZHUE8HnJGYxv-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9693867/akrales_171113_2119_0045.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6p1Qub"&gt;The best deal right now on the Apple Watch SE 40mm with GPS is at Amazon, which has knocked $10 off its normal price in gold or space gray, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f487a960520964ac860d89f77404bb1b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;price down to $269&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f16e9235da90ab510af5e23d08d74daf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$280 in silver with a white band&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b1bbcc98b9b514babd7b0198463cd917&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$294 in space gray&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b1bbcc98b9b514babd7b0198463cd917&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
