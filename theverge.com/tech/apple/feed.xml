    <title>Updating an Apple Watch Series 3 is a nightmare in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Novi9Y"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 3 was first released in September 2017, bringing fitness improvements and a faster processor. Nearly four years later, in 2021, Apple is still selling the Series 3 as its entry-level Apple Watch model starting at $199, an $80 savings compared to the more recent Apple Watch SE. Only, as I’ve recently learned, “still selling” and “supporting in a reasonable manner” are two very different things, and updating an Apple Watch Series 3 in 2021 is a nightmare of infuriating technological hoops to jump through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoLbgp"&gt;Normally, updating an Apple Watch is an annoyingly long but straightforward process: you charge your Watch up to 50 percent, plug it in, and wait for the slow process of the update transferring and installing to your smartwatch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBMQL9"&gt;But the non-cellular Apple Watch Series 3 has a tiny 8GB of internal storage, a fair chunk of which is taken up by the operating system and other critical software. So installing a major update — like the recently released watchOS 7.4 — goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="N0ZP6p"&gt;Unpair and wipe your Apple Watch to factory settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="onsN8l"&gt;Set up the Apple Watch again and restore from backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CuJz8D"&gt;Realize you weren’t supposed to restore from your backup yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HHVXuu"&gt;Watch an episode or two of &lt;em&gt;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&lt;/em&gt; while you wait for the backup to finish restoring &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JC5thp"&gt;Start from step one again — but as a brand-new Apple Watch, without restoring from an existing backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8em0yG"&gt;Update completely fresh Apple Watch, which now has enough free memory to update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y27oSu"&gt;Consider how much you actually want to use this face unlocking feature everyone keeps hyping up in the first place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vTOHQq"&gt;Unpair and wipe the Apple Watch a third time &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zfIcLk"&gt;Restore from your backup and finally use normally &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="VN9e8r"&gt;And the issue seems to apply whether you’ve installed a pile of apps or not. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211283"&gt;Apple’s support website doesn’t even recommend&lt;/a&gt; that Series 3 owners bother trying to clear up space — it just advocates that they go straight to the aforementioned reset cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbnkFB3jL9oVCroM-h2Unt8uiVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491512/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_2.22.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2pBJTT"&gt;It’s clear that the current process is untenable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnU84A"&gt;I’m an editor at a technology news site and willing to put in the comical amount of time and energy to manage this, frustrating as it might be. But if you’re a more casual user — the same one who is likely to own an older, outdated Watch in the first place — why on earth would you bother with the worst update mechanism since GE’s instructions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18692583/c-by-ge-reset-insanity-internet-of-shit"&gt;for resetting a smart bulb&lt;/a&gt;? And being able to update your hardware’s software is important: the just-released watchOS 7.4.1, for example, patches a critical security flaw. But with it being so difficult to install, there’s a good chance that plenty of Series 3 owners won’t bother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhAbfO"&gt;I know that Apple loves to claim support for as many older hardware generations as it can with each new update. It’s one of the biggest appeals of Apple products, compared to the lackluster pace of updates on competing Android phones (like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419205/samsung-galaxy-s8-security-update-schedule"&gt;just-deprecated Galaxy S8&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAhjoU"&gt;But the miserable update process for the Series 3 is a strong argument that Apple is being a little too generous with what it considers “current” hardware. Keeping the Series 3 around this long was always a money grab, a way for Apple to clear out old inventory and take advantage of mature manufacturing processes that have long since broken even in order to appeal to users who &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; can’t afford the extra $80 for the markedly better Apple Watch SE. It’s a similar trend to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-tv%2Fapple-tv-hd%2F32gb&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419569%2Fapple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inexplicably still-on-sale Apple TV HD&lt;/a&gt;, which is almost six years old and costs just $30 less than the brand-new 4K model. (Much like the Series 3, don’t buy a new Apple TV HD in 2021 either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m3cqV"&gt;But hopefully, with the announcement of watchOS 8 almost assuredly around the corner at WWDC this June, the company takes into account the basic functionality of its hardware when considering what it does and doesn’t offer support for. Because if Apple is going to insist on selling a product this old in the future, it’s going to need to be a lot more mindful of just how it actually handles its software support. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Sweeney emailed Tim Cook personally to call for open app sales after WWDC in 2015</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook (Verge, 640)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbe3UHKqsId6fTW2JmCFhhPSQg4=/0x0:716x477/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69236646/tim-cook_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jdmmXn"&gt;Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney was asking Apple to open its phones to other app stores as early as 2015, according to new emails made public as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the companies’ antitrust trial&lt;/a&gt;. Under the subject line “iOS as an open platform,” Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20697668-tim-sweeney-tim-cook-email-open-ios"&gt;emailed Apple CEO Tim Cook directly&lt;/a&gt; to make the case for allowing other app stores to distribute software on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biLoWU"&gt;“The App Store has done much good for the industry,” Sweeney wrote to Cook, “but it doesn’t seem tenable for Apple to be the sole arbiter of expression and commerce over an app platform approaching a billion users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtfE9M"&gt;In particular, Sweeney asked to “separate iOS App Store curation from compliance review and app distribution,” essentially suggesting that Apple could maintain its security features across the platform without routing all downloads through the central App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nZVAkS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it doesn’t seem tenable for Apple to be the sole arbiter of expression and commerce over an app platform approaching a billion users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="roU80u"&gt;It’s a powerful distinction for the ongoing trial, in which Apple is arguing that App Store exclusivity is necessary to maintain the existing security and privacy features on iOS. These are part of the compliance process referenced by Sweeney in the email, and other ecosystems have been successful in implementing them across multiple app stores. Most recently, Google introduced a similar system on Android &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect"&gt;under the name Play Protect&lt;/a&gt;, guarding against malicious downloads even from side-loaded software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oVmTZ"&gt;Cook responded by forwarding the message to Phil Schiller with a question: “Is this the guy that was at one of our rehearsals?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2UxLp"&gt;It’s likely that he was: a few weeks earlier, Epic Games had made &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChIuImrOsaY"&gt;an appearance at Apple’s WWDC event&lt;/a&gt;, touting the company’s work using Apple’s Metal API, although Sweeney did not appear onstage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C8jWzT"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20697668-tim-sweeney-tim-cook-email-open-ios/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Tim-Sweeney-Tim-Cook-Email-open-ios (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vCXtBs"&gt;Other emails show Sweeney continuing to push Apple behind the scenes, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20697673-px-2421"&gt;asking Epic co-founder Mark Rein&lt;/a&gt; to push for a meeting with Greg Joswiak in January 2018. “If the App Store [were] merely the premier way for consumers to install software and not the sole way, then Apple could curate higher quality software overall, without acting as a censor on free expression,” Sweeney argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcNNXA"&gt;Rein was ultimately able to arrange a hearing for the idea through Apple’s Tim Kirby and expressed enthusiasm. “He was definitely receptive to the idea,” Rein wrote, “which doesn’t mean it will go anywhere, but does mean he’ll line up people who will listen and not shoot it down like Phil Schiller would.... so maybe there’s a smallest little crack on the very outer surface of the many feet of ice covering the frozen lake that is the Apple store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3xn7J"&gt;Six years later, the ice has yet to thaw.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I watched the Epic v. Apple trial on Discord</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_2ofJo03CB67DgkOlh75y4KH9A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69234875/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jrLMk1"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial started on Monday, and if you wanted to follow along and listen to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney talk about the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;metaverse&lt;/a&gt;,” your options were limited. In theory, there’s public access to the trial, like most court proceedings, but since the courthouse is still closed for lockdown, the only access was through the court’s teleconference line that was briefly overrun by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417347/epic-games-apple-fortnite-trial-public-call"&gt;screaming teens&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuIgNO"&gt;But for anyone looking for more user-friendly options, there’s good news. A surprising, small community of streamers has decided to rebroadcast the trial on streaming platforms — places built for the people who play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;rather than the antitrust policy wonks in the courtroom. For yesterday’s proceeding, I found a handful of YouTube channels and streamers rebroadcasting the hearing online, including Geoff Keighley (gaming’s Ryan Seacrest) on the Game Awards YouTube channel. Keighley’s YouTube stream sat at around 1,000 viewers throughout Monday’s events, featuring an active side chat filled with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans and foes negging the day’s witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wW2h1"&gt;Technically, you’re not supposed to do this. &lt;a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/cases-e-filing/cases-of-interest/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;The court’s website&lt;/a&gt; explicitly tells users that “any recording, copying, or rebroadcasting of a remote court hearing is absolutely prohibited.” Electronic recording devices &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/02/27/politics/supreme-court-video"&gt;are often banned&lt;/a&gt; from public sessions for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIF6SS"&gt;But because you’re breaking the court’s rules and not copyright law, streaming the trial is much less likely to result in an account strike than a sports or television live stream. And while conventional media outlets could have their press credentials stripped for defying the ban, most streamers are far enough outside that system that they don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZdr3c"&gt;A separate &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;streamer, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmpwZJPSf_QPSKxY9CFCstg"&gt;Golden&lt;/a&gt; (112,000 subscribers), was also following the court hearing, providing commentary for his followers interested in the day’s events. In order to avoid ticking off the court, he muted the trial’s audio and provided a link to Keighley’s stream for viewers looking to follow along themselves. He also listed his Discord server in the video’s bio and had three audio rooms dedicated to re-streaming Keighley’s audio. The Discord’s general chat was a mix of armchair antitrust lawyers and others complaining about Sweeney’s bad mic setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcAJiv"&gt;“Bruh this audio,” one person wrote, responding to Sweeney’s mumbling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7vrjf"&gt;It’s hard to say how many streamers will be active for today’s proceedings — but if you’re hoping to follow along, searching YouTube and Twitch for rebroadcasts might turn up more options than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2o02Oo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest price you can grab a pair right now is for $190 at Woot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UPRyK"&gt;If that deal sells out, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are selling them for $197. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163118618412109#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling the AirPods Pros for $200, while &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F66960X1514734X399deab46224a444932767312ff6c84b#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; has knocked $29 off, bringing the price down to $220. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on Apple MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MacBook Air is the most impressive laptop I’ve used in years" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1z5Ah"&gt;With multiple configurations and various MacBook models available for purchase, including ones equipped with the new M1 processor, finding a deal on an Apple MacBook is not very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals on the Mac mini computer. Of course, there are frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations, and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a full one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base configuration of MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD and typically sells for $999. Right now, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$949 ($50 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ADk8N"&gt;Amazon also has the 512GB configuration on sale; you can get it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5R2GQW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $1,180&lt;/a&gt; ($70 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The MacBook Pro comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afDps1"&gt;The upgraded version of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LM1K3/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-touting MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD in space gray or silver is $200 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, costing $1,300 once you reach checkout. This model normally costs $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can buy some older MacBook Pro models: one includes the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. It features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and storage configurations. You can save $200 on the 13-inch model at Amazon, which is available in two configurations: a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,600 at Amazon, or you can buy one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; processor for $1,800 at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to the processor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and better speakers. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FZV45H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in space gray on sale for $2,199 ($200 off). There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FV1Y57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another configuration available in the same color&lt;/a&gt;, but more storage (1TB) and an Intel Core i9 processor available for $2,499 ($300 off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QLBQ9T"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the Mac mini is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the mini has Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We have seen this computer go down as low as $600 (for the base model), but you can get it for $30 off its usual starting price of $699 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple exec suggested cutting App Store commission to 20 percent as early as 2011  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16njifWKFBkVDPeEQh6E-YsQSL4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69233189/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zza0EY"&gt;Phil Schiller, the Apple executive in charge of the App Store, raised the possibility of the company cutting its 30 percent commission rate to 25 or even 20 percent back in 2011 in response to competition. Schiller floated the idea in an email to then Apple CEO Steve Jobs and head of Apple services Eddy Cue. The email has been made public as part of the company’s legal battle with Epic Games. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-03/apple-s-schiller-floated-cutting-app-store-fees-a-decade-ago"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; was first to report&lt;/a&gt; on the email exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUm3TS"&gt;“Do we think our 70/30 split will last forever?” Schiller’s email begins. “I think someday we will see enough challenge from another platform or web based solutions to want to adjust our model.” Schiller goes on to suggest that if Apple were to ever change its fee structure, that it should do so “from a position of strength rather than weakness” and floats the idea of Apple dropping its commission rate once the App Store is generating over $1 billion in annual profit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/euxcs3tMSokIuuQfIBQNMr_JBu0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490583/msedge_zQcryfwNlN.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Court Documents&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The email, released as part of Epic’s lawsuit against Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ueOTsi"&gt;“I know that this is controversial, I just tee it up as another way to look at the size of the business, what we want to achieve, and how we stay competitive,” Schiller wrote. “Just food for thought.” Attached to the email is a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-TEB-2920"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; article from 2011&lt;/a&gt; which discussed the possibility of developers using web apps to bypass Apple’s App Store fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNGN3R"&gt;Apple’s 30 percent commission on many in-app purchases is central to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;legal battle with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, which has accused the App Store tied to iPhones and iPads of being a monopoly. Epic is required to use Apple’s payment method for in-app purchases within &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; (and hence pay a 30 percent commission), and it was the company’s switch to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;offering its own in-app payments system&lt;/a&gt; that caused Apple to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;kick the game out of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wbMf0u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just food for thought”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mBOcJQ"&gt;In response to the email, Apple said there is no evidence that the App Store’s fees are tied to its profit, and that the 2011 email did not confirm the store made $1 billion in profit, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. Analysis from Sensor Tower has the App Store’s 2020 commissions revenue at around $22 billion, and Epic cites one witness who claims that its profit rate sits at around 80 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJzQ7K"&gt;Apple has adjusted its commission structure over the years, but has never dropped it standard rate wholesale to 25 or 20 percent. In 2016 it dropped its commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12774758/apple-developers-app-store-new-subscription-rules"&gt;to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for subscribers who have signed up to a service for over a year. Then, last year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;dropped its rate to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for any developers who make under $1 million in sales on its store. The move &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573109/epic-tim-sweeney-apple-app-store-fee-cut-reduction-criticize"&gt;saw pushback from Apple’s critics&lt;/a&gt;, with Epic CEO Tim Sweeney calling the decision “a calculated move by Apple to divide app creators and preserve their monopoly on stores and payments, again breaking the promise of treating all developers equally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96407b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic spent at least $11.6 million on free games and gained 5 million new users in return</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AwAhTIgdV3YviSvaMcHbwEDtJTw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69232973/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k86eje"&gt;A new document released as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic’s legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt; has revealed how much Epic paid developers to give away their games for free following the launch of the Epic Games Store in December 2018. The document, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simoncarless/status/1389297530341519362"&gt;spotted by writer Simon Carless&lt;/a&gt;, covers the 38 games given away free between December and September the following year. We already know that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380895/epic-games-store-afford-give-away-17-5-billion-free-games"&gt;Epic is spending millions on its giveaways&lt;/a&gt;, but the new document reveals how much that translates to on a per-game basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tv81v1"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1381109913112489987"&gt;previously revealed&lt;/a&gt; that the company pays a flat fee to each developer to give away their games, rather than paying per download. Over the period covered by the document, Epic paid over $11.6 million in total for the games. In response to the deals, almost five million new users signed up to the store, which translates to Epic paying $2.37 for each new user it signed up in this period. That’s money which the company would theoretically make back if each new user went on to buy just one $20 game, based on the 12 percent commission Epic takes on new purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRRbkd735ESFi8qr8wJwF0OLZ40=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490550/A0nJVFA.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A table showing how much Epic paid for each free game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XYopGl"&gt;Beyond the ten months covered in the table, Epic says it’s acquired a total of 18.5 million new users via free game giveaways, and that around 7 percent of them, or about 1.3 million people, go on to make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FrAPAs3LZaZ8eSjtrwGuZviBw4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490554/image__8_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A summary of how many total users Epic’s giveaways have attracted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MFTuaz"&gt;There’s a huge amount of variance between how much Epic paid for each giveaway. At the top end is the $1.5 million it paid to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875378/batman-arham-asylum-city-knight-free-epic-games-store-lego-batman"&gt;give away the Batman Arkham trilogy games&lt;/a&gt;, but it also paid substantial amounts for &lt;em&gt;Subnautica &lt;/em&gt;($1.4 million) and M&lt;em&gt;utant Year Zero&lt;/em&gt; ($1 million). In comparison, the company paid much less for indie titles like &lt;em&gt;Super Meat Boy&lt;/em&gt; ($50,000), &lt;em&gt;Jackbox Party Pack&lt;/em&gt; ($60,000), and &lt;em&gt;Fez&lt;/em&gt; ($75,000). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijADBA"&gt;At only 38 titles, the list covers less than half &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1381021318640979968"&gt;of the 100+ games&lt;/a&gt; Epic has given away on its store since its launch. It also doesn’t cover one of Epic’s biggest giveaways from May 2020 when it made &lt;em&gt;GTA5 &lt;/em&gt;free on its store. Rockstar’s title proved so popular that the store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258043/epic-games-store-down-gta-5-grand-theft-auto-free-pc"&gt;was knocked offline for several hours&lt;/a&gt; as everyone tried to claim their free copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyt2Mh"&gt;As well as paying to give away existing games for free, Epic has also paid for upcoming games to be released exclusively on its store. Another document released as part of the legal proceedings and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simoncarless/status/1389372260067123200"&gt;found by Carless&lt;/a&gt; reveals that Epic paid a $146 million advance for a deal that included &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; exclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BwM2P"&gt;The new numbers were made public as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic’s legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer is accusing Apple’s App Store of being a monopoly, and takes issue with the 30 percent commission Apple charges on many in-app purchases. With the court trial having kicked off this week, expect more of the inner workings of each company to be made public in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s once again time to update your iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch as soon as possible</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IcVriv"&gt;I know there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;a ton of other Apple news happening today&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re reading it on a Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch (okay, that last one may be a stretch), you should probably pause and update that device — today’s update fixes a security issue that &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212336"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; may have been actively exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPKvyv"&gt;The updates contained in &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212336"&gt;iOS / iPadOS 14.5.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212335"&gt;macOS 11.3.1&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212339"&gt;watchOS 7.4.1&lt;/a&gt; are meant to fix arbitrary code execution exploits present in WebKit, Apple’s framework that renders most of the web content you see on your device (unless you’re using, say, Chrome or Firefox on Mac). In normal language, the updates patch a hole that let malicious websites run unchecked code on your device, so it’s not the type of update you want to put off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8xbf2"&gt;If you have an older device, such as an iPhone 5s or 6, iPad Air or Mini 2 and 3, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212341"&gt;Apple also released iOS 12.5.3&lt;/a&gt;, which addresses WebKit flaws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIiN7j"&gt;If this story sounds a little familiar, it’s because there have been two recent updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251149/iphone-update-14-4-fixes-exploited-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;iOS 14.4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352676/iphone-ios-update-fixes-xss-exploit-security-issue"&gt;14.4.2&lt;/a&gt;, that closed similar security holes. Even if you don’t think you should update because you use an alternative web browser on your Mac, or don’t browse the web on your Apple Watch (for obvious reasons), it’s still worth updating any devices you may have — WebKit can be used in unexpected places, and it’s never good to have security holes open on your devices, especially ones that may have been exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BDV7F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article stated that the iOS 12.5.3 update was available for the iPhone 5. It is actually available for the iPhone 5s. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are Apple’s and Epic’s full slideshows arguing why they should win at trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncr4l-L-A4U6IklCTAA7TgKXwGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69229294/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UVIIeO"&gt;Both Apple and Epic have released their opening presentations on why they feel they should win this week’s trial, which is set to determine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the future of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. In the documents, which you can look through below, each company lays out its case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXsOf4"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;lawsuit started&lt;/a&gt; when Apple removed Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from the App Store after Epic bypassed Apple’s system for in-app purchases. But it’s turned into a much deeper examination of Apple’s walled-garden approach to technology, and whether some of the walls the company puts up might violate antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01XMHx"&gt;We took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;a deeper look at the companies’ legal strategies&lt;/a&gt; in advance of the trial, but you can see the same arguments play out in these presentations. Epic uses metaphors of brick walls and gas stations to argue that Apple’s control over what can and cannot be installed on the iPhone is unfair, and that allowing other methods of installing apps wouldn’t harm iOS’s security. Apple pushes back saying that Epic getting the openness that it wants would harm not just the App Store but other stores from Sony and Nintendo. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZYqwTfbX2vk4FqDWTzaFfIYSDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/vpavic_200805_4131_0086_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="TNIRIb"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWFA5k"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JHLP0"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt; Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s just over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people.  While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gY4Mp"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; is your best bet right now. It comes with an excellent 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz fast refresh rate, still a rarity at this price point. Even better, Samsung says it will offer four years of security updates, including three years of major OS upgrades. The A52 5G isn’t the cheapest — it’s priced right at $500 — but that healthy support policy means you’ll get many years out of your investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="2Gej3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462499"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bkDOPH"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZnehD"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, and you definitely won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOgwn4"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5TvHua"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tETMb0"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAfzxG"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB1ZXR"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ykrqeX"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7jGjKdcssyDUAL1Vc67gH-WoCNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465667/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best budget Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7CPw9a"&gt;On the Android side, the Galaxy A52 5G is a great option, albeit at the very top of the price range considered in this guide. It includes some features that aren’t too common in a budget phone, like its fast-refresh rate screen, an IP67 water resistance rating, and for now at least, monthly security updates for fast access to bug fixes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s379P4"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIaTf"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating is handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RSNCy0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if you want to make an investment in a phone that you can keep using years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwHMHO"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright-spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 4A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFmNNo"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGMHIJ_EFkQE2rMcf3ISzHc3EYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691927/vpavic_4113_20200721_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ndqid1"&gt;An affordable Android phone with the best camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nCclP5"&gt;If you want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt; Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huw9Ph"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera. It’s based on generation-old technology at this point, but it’s still the best in this class and it can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g65TGg"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrF1h5"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it, putting you first in line for Android updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XggNCE"&gt;Unfortunately, in a little over a year’s time, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be slowing down. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7VV1d"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for well under $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord has very good specs for its price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VceItk"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US, and the company doesn’t plan to sell it in the States. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B grade in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCe0u5"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high refresh rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdWibC"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is strong, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5llXq"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple of selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality, and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t work correctly on US LTE networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;If you want an inexpensive 5G phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zVN77Q"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;If you can afford to spend a little more, you probably should. A device with better support in the long run will save you some money later. But if budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The budget phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;If top-notch battery performance is an extremely important feature in your smartphone, then the Moto G Power should be on your shortlist. It’s capable, and you really will get multiple days of battery life on a charge. But if you’re fine getting by on a battery that’s just average, then we think you’ll be happier with a more well-rounded device.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Play covers all of the basics for well under $200.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zLkqZB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Motorola Moto G Play (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0rkwQp"&gt;The best phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8w9H"&gt;There are plenty of options for those shopping on a tighter budget, but the Motorola Moto G Play is the one that stands out to us. It covers the basics well with a big 5,000mAh battery and a Snapdragon 460 processor that does a good enough job handling daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHIya"&gt;The G Play has a generously sized 6.5-inch screen. It’s a lower-resolution panel at 720p and is difficult to see outside in direct light, but it’s more or less just fine. Camera specs are likewise basic: there’s just one rear-facing 13-megapixel camera that performs well in bright light but isn’t well suited for low-light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTXRvU"&gt;You’ll also want to strongly consider a microSD card purchase with this phone. It only includes 32GB of built-in storage, a lot of which is already occupied by system files. Motorola has only promised security updates for two years, but realistically, the G Play isn’t built to last much longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhtEOa"&gt;It has its shortcomings — the G Play’s performance doesn’t keep up with many phones that are just $50-100 more expensive, for example — but it’s hard to argue with what it does offer for its price: good, basic performance without any major flaws. If there’s flexibility in your budget to spend a little more, you’ll get some meaningful upgrades, like a better camera or a longer-lasting device. But for its price, the G Play does just what it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;
