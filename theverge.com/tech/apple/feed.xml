    <title>Apple updates iOS 15 to fix the iPhone 13’s Apple Watch unlock bug</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FE8LgD"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup just launched last week, but some users ran into a frustrating issue where they couldn’t use their Apple Watch to unlock their new phones while wearing a face mask. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22694679/apple-fix-issue-unlock-apple-watch-feature-iphone-13"&gt;had promised&lt;/a&gt; that a fix was on the way, and it appeared earlier this week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22699884/iphone-13-apple-watch-unlock-bug-fix-ios-15-beta"&gt;in an iOS 15.1 beta&lt;/a&gt;, but now, the fix is live for everyone as part of the iOS 15.0.1 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64mbPr"&gt;Apple’s official patch notes also say that the update includes other bug fixes, but the company didn’t specify what those might be. The update clocks in at 553.7MB on my iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ij7SMRdNePJUekUr58RvZ1-1tL8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894075/IMG_1169.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are Apple’s iOS 15.0.1 update notes, taken from my iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5vL8HJ"&gt;Apple added the ability to use your Apple Watch to unlock a Face ID-equipped phone while wearing a mask &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s proved to be a handy feature as masks are still recommended in many situations due to the pandemic. With this new software update, it seems that iPhone 13 users who were affected by the bug stopping the feature from working will be able to take advantage of the convenient unlocks once more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the Surface Laptop Studio and Surface Pro 8 stack up against other creator laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop Studio" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KG1pPCiMFMJcaHhRsaVgZ3en4r0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69933878/bfarsace_210921_4770_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5FWQMS"&gt;Microsoft announced a new version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685923/microsoft-surface-pro-8-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt; last week, along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;. The Surface Pro 8 feels very much like a logical evolution of Microsoft’s tablet / laptop. Some of the more notable improvements include a 120Hz display with slimmer bezels, Thunderbolt 4 support, as well as a reworked surface keyboard that includes a dedicated space to store and charge the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCXxU1"&gt;Meanwhile, the Surface Laptop Studio features a uniquely hinged screen and more powerful hardware. This is effectively a replacement for the Surface Book 3, with a three-point adjustable display that can lay flat for drawing or snap upright to deliver a more traditional laptop experience. This laptop comes equipped with an Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti GPU and a four-core, 4.8GHz, 11th Gen Intel processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CY3oWn"&gt;Perhaps the coolest thing to come out of the event was the Surface Slim Pen 2, which aesthetically appears like any other stylus, but includes haptic feedback to simulate the subtle tactile response you get from putting a pen to paper. While the inclusion of a stylus is hardly revolutionary, improvements to the overall user experience are nice to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mpq31I"&gt;But how do the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686705/microsoft-surface-pro-8-keyboard-screen-photos-video-hands-on"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686706/microsoft-surface-studio-laptop-design-specs-photos-hands-on"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt; stack up against other laptops that occupy the creator and power user space? We’ve collected a few of our favorites below for comparison based on our early impressions and spec sheets, with full reviews to follow in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tYNcsP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder all of the new Surface hardware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683783/microsoft-surface-pro-x-8-3-go-laptop-studio-preorder-price-date"},{"title":"Here’s how much buying into Microsoft’s pro Surface vision actually costs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688403/surface-pro-8-duo-studio-x-go-true-price-keyboard-pen-stylus-bundle"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ot9Igy"&gt;Versus the Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ma4ruS"&gt;We chose the 14-inch models of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre X360&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"&gt;Acer ConceptD Ezel&lt;/a&gt; because of their competitive pricing, which includes a stylus, and also for their ability to reorient themselves in some creative ways. (The new Microsoft devices don’t include the Surface Slim Pen 2, which costs $130 separately.) &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeCreatorLaptops093021&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-spectre-x360-laptop-14t-ea000-touch-1q881av-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Spectre&lt;/a&gt; is technically a 2-in-1 and can operate effectively as a tablet if you flip the screen over, though it doesn’t hold it up at an angle quite like the Surface Laptop Studio. The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Facer-conceptd-7-ezel-cc715-71-7196-laptop%2F8v916pqmq44c%3Focid%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%28ir__0thgbaanw9kfqhhygvquhus6yn2xrv21qkgxj29e00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28nOD_rLJHOac-8dpOdXgdIleApxHzJMABfw%29%28%29%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%252frLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-8dpOdXgdIleApxHzJMABfw%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-8dpOdXgdIleApxHzJMABfw%26irgwc%3D1%26irclickid%3D_0thgbaanw9kfqhhygvquhus6yn2xrv21qkgxj29e00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ConceptD Ezel&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, can flip out its screen and prop itself up like an easel or lay flat like a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7CWKEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10777072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qmwVig"&gt;We also threw in the Laptop Studio’s predecessor, the 13.5-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt;. The screen may not fold or flip, but it can still operate as a tablet when detached from its keyboard. We considered adding the 15-inch version of the Surface Book 3, but its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Book-3%2F8XBW9G3Z71F1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting price of $2,300&lt;/a&gt; made it just a little too expensive when stacked against its competition.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lS2sz3"&gt;Still, the Surface Laptop Studio sets itself apart by offering a greater battery life and likely a superior dedicated GPU option to any of these other machines. It also has the distinction of being the only laptop in our lineup with a 120Hz refresh rate display, a feature typically reserved for gaming laptops. You’d generally need to look at a gaming-class laptop if you need a higher-end GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="30BNMX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10768014"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HKxepF"&gt;Versus the Surface Pro 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3PomAq"&gt;The unique form factor of Surface devices makes them tough to compare, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;Lenovo Yoga 9i&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple MacBook M1 Air&lt;/a&gt; make a strong case as ultraportables outside the Surface ecosystem that cater to creatives, and we’re also including the previous-gen &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pro 7&lt;/a&gt; for comparison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04Pq9K"&gt;Like previous generations of Surface, the new Surface Pro 8 doesn’t come with a pen or keyboard to start. The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-slim-pen-2%2F8tb9xw8rwc14%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-signature-keyboard%2F90fj6zkw1rzb%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pro Signature Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; will cost you $130 and $180, respectively, but can also be &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-signature-keyboard-with-slim-pen-2%2F8vdb5vrkc5tq%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundled for $280&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, the other laptops we’re discussing come with built-in keyboards, and the Yoga i9 includes the pen as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zk9g3e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771697"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="95GkMo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfFKTLj8MM4#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; also shares many of the same hardware specifications as the Surface Pro 8, with options for an 11th Gen Core i5 or i7 CPU. It does make a couple of compromises, most notably in the resolution and refresh rate of its display. These caveats could be overlooked by anyone who needs to save a little more money, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpMQIw"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook M1 Air&lt;/a&gt; is really the outlier of this lineup, not just because of its OS, but because it’s also the only laptop we picked that doesn’t have a touchscreen or can operate as a 2-in-1. It does, however, strike a solid balance in terms of features, performance, and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nL0Tae"&gt;The biggest draw for the Surface Pro 8 — besides its unique form factor — is the display, which boasts the highest resolution and refresh rate out of the contenders below. It’s also the only model that features a 4K rear camera.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8udLq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10771732"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple’s fortress of secrecy is crumbling from the inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQgpmeLeDb2phUsQM5iLRkfnRVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932920/acastro_210913_4747_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The last five months marked a turning point in Apple’s company culture — will it last?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="n53OkX"&gt;On June 14th, 2021, Apple’s remote work advocacy group sent an anonymous email to Tim Cook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aR6Zrr"&gt;“We all agree that we are here at Apple to make insanely great products that enrich people’s lives and the world,” they wrote. “We are convinced that we can create the same, and even better products by adding more flexibility to the announced return to office policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUAH5O"&gt;Two weeks earlier, Cook had announced that after a difficult year working remotely, Apple was reopening its offices. Starting in September, employees would be asked to return to in-person work three days a week, with the option to work from home on Wednesdays and Fridays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2MFRX"&gt;The news wasn’t surprising — Apple’s executive team had never pretended they wanted to go fully remote. But it didn’t sit well with staff members who’d moved away from Apple’s offices during the pandemic and had little desire to go back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uE0LFr"&gt;The tension might have stayed at a low simmer were it not for a Slack channel — #remote-work-advocacy — created in September 2020 to promote a more flexible working environment. By the summer of 2021, it had reached roughly 2,800 members, with conversations growing increasingly lively. After Cook made his announcement, employees knew they had to send a message. It was a small push back against management that would lay the groundwork for months of employee organizing and perhaps change the Apple workforce forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2QL9em"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not everyone is afraid that their boss at Apple is going to fire them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IVX1de"&gt;Apple’s remote work struggle is emblematic of a deeper shift taking place inside the company. Since 1976, the tech giant has operated in largely the same way: executives make decisions about how the company will function, and employees either fall in line or leave. What choice do they have? Apple is currently worth $2 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world, as well as one of the most powerful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6bFWj"&gt;Over the past few months, however, that culture has started to erode. As workers across the tech industry advocate for more power, Apple’s top-down management seems more out of touch than ever before. Now, a growing number of employees are organizing internally for change and speaking out about working conditions on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZcNzI"&gt;“There’s a shift in the balance of power going on here,” says Jason Snell, the former editor of &lt;em&gt;Macworld, &lt;/em&gt;who’s been covering Apple since the 1990s. “Not everyone is afraid that their boss at Apple is going to fire them. They’re saying, ‘I’m going to say some bad things about Apple, and if you move against me, it’s going to look bad for you.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkVDrp"&gt;The shift is due in part to the fact that the tech giant is two years into a radical new experiment: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22659497/apple-slack-organizing-zoe-schiffer-decoder-interview"&gt;using Slack&lt;/a&gt;. Where Apple employees previously worked in ultra-siloed teams with little opportunity to meet people outside their current project or department, they now have a way to communicate with anyone across the company. Employees have discovered that individual work grievances are shared by people in entirely different parts of Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNJas1"&gt;The details of these grievances vary. Some employees want the company to invest in internal tools to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;better protect their privacy&lt;/a&gt;. Others want more transparency in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22633141/apple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap"&gt;how much people are paid&lt;/a&gt;. Many who’ve spoken to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; feel like Apple’s employee relations team has been woefully inadequate in addressing their workplace concerns. The overarching desire — the thing that connects the tenured software engineer in Cupertino with the retail employee in New Jersey — is that employees want to feel heard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhXKPi"&gt;So far, it’s not entirely clear Apple executives want to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OjwvBu"&gt;
&lt;p id="73RZT1"&gt;When Kate Rotondo started working as a software engineering author at Apple in August 2018, she did so knowing she was an exception: while most of Apple’s corporate workforce was in person, she would be allowed to work from home once a week, with the option of “earning” a second remote day after six months on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6IAQY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;She made $10,000 to $15,000 less in base pay than the others at her same job level.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXl9sp"&gt;By Apple’s standards, it was a compromise. What Rotondo wanted, what she’d asked for, was to be fully remote. The last three years had taken it out of her. She’d moved from Tübingen, Germany, to San Francisco, gotten a divorce, and was now raising her nine-year-old son under complicated co-parenting conditions. The last thing she needed was a three to four hour commute. But her manager was firm: working entirely from home wasn’t an option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bN4DN"&gt;When she started her new job, Rotondo was surprised to find that this hiring manager was entirely remote himself. As were her three other team members — all men. Rotondo was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; person on her team required to go into the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78ttAe"&gt;Still, it was Apple. What was Rotondo going to do? She put it out of her mind for six months, until she spoke to a colleague who was going from contract to full-time and wanted to talk about compensation. He was being leveled as an ICT-4 — one level above Rotondo — and would be making $25,000 more in base pay, with an additional $20,000 more in restricted stock units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6xpRk"&gt;The revelation shocked Rotondo. She felt like she was more experienced than her male colleagues. While they’d worked at Apple longer, she’d co-authored a book about the programming language Adobe AIR, taught coding at Mills College and the continuing education department at the Rhode Island School of Design, and was an expert in Apple’s own iOS programming language Swift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1p24j"&gt;She started chatting with peers and found that — of the eight other engineering authors she’d spoken to in her org — she was the lowest paid. She made $10,000 to $15,000 less in base pay than the others at her same job level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmwkUK"&gt;During her review cycle the following year, her manager told her she was achieving expectations and praised how quickly she’d gotten up to speed on the team. He said she was getting a $5,000 bump in base pay and a $3,000 refresher in restricted stock units — far less than what she’d expected. The lowest RSU refresher she’d heard of up until that point was $50,000, over 16 times more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hygMR1"&gt;Rotondo explained to her manager that she felt she was being under-leveled and underpaid, citing the conversations she’d had with colleagues. He countered that she needed to outperform her co-workers in order to be considered for a promotion. To Rotondo, it felt like she was being asked to go above and beyond what her male colleagues were asked to do. They’d come in making more money than her — and they were fully remote. She was achieving expectations while commuting three to four hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMu41C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the leak felt violating.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ioy4mV"&gt;Rotondo took the issue to her manager’s manager. He roped in a member of the employee relations team — Apple’s version of HR — who said they would open an investigation. Two months later, a representative came back and said the employee relations team had found Rotondo was leveled and paid fairly. “You’re getting a $0.00 adjustment,” they added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhkXtY"&gt;Shortly afterward, Rotondo resigned. She’d been at Apple nearly two years and felt completely isolated in her battle — gaslit by her managers and Apple’s employee relations team. She had no clear way to air her grievances with colleagues who might feel the same. Five months later, she filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUrKB9"&gt;It would be months before other Apple employees started connecting on Slack and speaking out on Twitter about pay equity and sexism — the very issues Rotondo was trying to fix. But by then, it would already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PK4Vix"&gt;
&lt;p id="M7MrFc"&gt;Before May 2021, the public rarely heard from Apple employees like Kate Rotondo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ObIA5"&gt;“There was a perception that when you went behind the curtain at Apple, you’d never be heard from again,” says Jason Snell. Steve Jobs was so adamant about keeping his workforce under wraps that he removed all the names from the ‘About’ boxes on the software when he returned to Apple in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhUh6X"&gt;Internally, that secrecy is enforced through a series of norms and rules. The norms are simple: don’t speak publicly about Apple unless you’ve been specifically asked. The rules are less so: Employee badges only open certain doors, based on the projects on which they’re disclosed. They’re asked to sign project-specific NDAs. Product documents are coded with internal keywords like “Ultra,” “Black,” and “White,” which connote how secret the work is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ruLLPf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a strong expectation that internal problems should be kept internal.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fRmMkp"&gt;Ultra projects — reserved for Apple’s biggest product launches — are tracked on an internal Apple system that monitors employees who have prototype devices. Apple requires vendors to sign an NDA as well as an Apple Restricted Project Agreement before they can receive information about this type of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZpAyA"&gt;“This environment of secrecy produces an unwritten hierarchy of ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’ within the company,” &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/9/11/16288896/apple-secrecy-inkling-culture-leadership-transparency-values"&gt;wrote former employee Matt Macinnis&lt;/a&gt;. “For the ‘haves,’ the hierarchy of disclosure is a way to exert influence and demonstrate power beyond one’s role or title. For ‘have-nots,’ it’s a subtle but constant reminder of your rank.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKdpEK"&gt;The Apple value that underpins all of this, elevating the secrecy concerns from an issue of potential lost revenue to one of core company DNA, is “surprise and delight.” It’s the idea that Apple products should catch the public unaware, giving them something they want before they even know they want it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cf0lSx"&gt;But the secrecy has bled over into other parts of Apple’s culture, too. Although the company specifically says that its policies “should not be interpreted as restricting your right to speak freely about your wages, hours, or working conditions,” the reality is that there’s a strong expectation that internal problems should be kept internal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4Ba1p"&gt;For many Apple employees, these idiosyncrasies are seen as the cost of working at Apple — one of, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;, most prestigious tech firm in Silicon Valley. People know what they’re getting into when they sign up. Employees stay for decades, giving up lucrative opportunities at early-stage startups because they believe in the company’s mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kB1ouK"&gt;But for others, the company’s refusal to listen to its own workforce is becoming a bigger sticking point, particularly during an era when the balance of power is shifting away from managers and toward rank and file employees — at least, everywhere but Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="C6knp6"&gt;
&lt;p id="i1spFf"&gt;On May 11th, 2021, a group of female Apple employees discovered that Apple had hired Antonio García Martínez, a former Facebook product manager, who’d written a Silicon Valley tell-all book containing misogynistic descriptions of women. One passage that began circulating internally said most women in the Bay Area were “soft and weak, cosseted and naïve despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5Ylsv"&gt;Employees discussed the issue in the #women-in-swe Slack channel, eventually deciding to write an internal letter to Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior VP of services. They didn’t want García Martínez to be fired necessarily; they just wanted answers as to how he’d been hired in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZqVGmv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the leak felt violating.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="djVjZW"&gt;García Martínez was set to work on privacy on the ad platforms team. His direct working group was all men. Apple’s VP of ad platforms, ​​Todd Teresi, had no women reporting directly to him, save for his chief of staff. The idea that there might not have been any women on García Martínez’s hiring panel infuriated Apple employees and further spurred the organizing effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JCD0n"&gt;The following day, while the letter was still being finalized, a version of it leaked to the press. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published it in full&lt;/a&gt;. Hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;García Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzzKYB"&gt;To many women in the channel, the leak felt violating. They’d meant for the letter to remain internal and genuinely wanted to engage Apple’s leadership and hear what they had to say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THGN3C"&gt;But it also marked a turning point in Apple employee organizing. After the &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; article was published, another group of employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;wrote a letter asking Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt; to publicly support Palestine amid a deadly bombing campaign from Israel. Then, the #remote-work-advocacy channel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;published a letter&lt;/a&gt; pushing back against returning to the office. They circulated a survey asking people how they felt about going back to in-person work. The results of the survey also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560586/apple-hybrid-work-internal-survey-tim-cook"&gt;quickly became public&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UyjxTq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Now, employees know that if their tweets get enough attention, they might be insulated from overt retaliation.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUkqLi"&gt;The advocacy brought Apple workers into a widespread campaign for change that had been shaking up the tech industry since at least 2018. Google employees &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html"&gt;staged major walkouts&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment. Amazon warehouse workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;attempted to unionize&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook employees seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"&gt;spent all of 2020 leaking their discontent to the press&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg5VJ5"&gt;This was the first time, however, that Apple employees had joined the fight: openly pushing back against the decisions — or non-decisions — of company leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G50OCx"&gt;Apple historically dissuaded employees from talking about work on social media — even in seemingly harmless ways. The company’s guidelines are vague: “Be thoughtful about how you present yourself in online social networks,” they read. “The lines between public and private, and personal and professional, are blurred in online social networks. In particular, it’s a priority that we respect the privacy of our customers and other employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAGdpF"&gt;Still, multiple employees tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that those who tweet about Apple quickly receive a note from the business communications team asking to chat. They don’t always get in trouble, but the message is clear: Apple executives are watching.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoZj9v"&gt;In the past, that was enough to stop most employees from speaking out. Now, employees know that if their tweets get enough attention, they might be insulated from overt retaliation. That is, unless Apple claims they’ve violated company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KVTxa5"&gt;
&lt;p id="U1YTVe"&gt;Cher Scarlett already had a significant Twitter following by the time she landed at Apple as a software engineer on the security team in April 2020. But for the first year, she didn’t tweet about workplace concerns. It wasn’t until news of García Martínez’s hiring started circulating internally that she finally decided to speak out.  “I have been gutted, as many other folks at Apple were, with the hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1392618677644767238?lang=en"&gt;she tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “I believe in the strength of community we have at Apple, &amp;amp; that the culture we’ve built can weather this. I also believe in leadership to do the right thing, whatever that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gp8idF"&gt;Over the next few months, Scarlett became more vocal about issues she was seeing at the company. When she looked at levels.fyi, a website for people to compare salary data, she realized that women on her team seemed to be making less than men — at least in her geographic area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LN6l2N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So Gjøvik decided to go nuclear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJJqeJ"&gt;She knew that Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;shut down three separate employee-run pay surveys&lt;/a&gt;, claiming they either contained personally identifiable information or were hosted on Apple’s corporate Box account, which wasn’t allowed. So she decided to run her own survey. After it got roughly 2,000 responses, she &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1426434491069861895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1426434491069861895%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22633141%2Fapple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap"&gt;tweeted out some of the results&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that there were far fewer women, non-binary, and non-white people in technical roles or senior positions at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIeVdh"&gt;News of the survey inspired others, including Kate Rotondo, to begin tweeting openly about their own issues trying to get paid and leveled fairly. It was too late for Rotondo to get justice from Apple — she’d already left the tech industry and was working as a potter in San Francisco — but the experience of speaking out was cathartic. The EEOC had not taken action on her case — a devastating blow for someone who hoped Apple might be held accountable and stopped from treating other workers unfairly. Now, she felt like the only way to told the company accountable was to speak out against its tactics on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Vz62Sn"&gt;
&lt;p id="e5U3He"&gt;On July 26th, 2021, Ashley Gjøvik, a senior engineering program manager, posed a question in the #women-in-swe Slack channel. “Do we think Apple does a sufficient job at handling employee complaints about discrimination?” she asked. “Do we feel comfortable even reporting issues?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUHnZg"&gt;The note sparked a long discussion from women who also felt misled by the tech giant’s HR team. Gjøvik herself shared that employee relations had investigated some of her complaints and told her “actions were taken.” “But when I pried further, there was no actual resolution or actions because no Apple ‘policies’ were violated,’” she wrote. Her sentiment was echoed by other women who said they’d experienced similar frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAbg0O"&gt;During the pandemic, Gjøvik had become increasingly concerned about the physical safety of the office. She already knew that her Apple department was located on a superfund site — meaning it required special oversight due to historical waste contamination. Then she received an email saying Apple wanted to do a vapor intrusion survey in the office and test the quality of the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T7bCBH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“ignore the problem, say as little as possible.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2ClVk"&gt;Gjøvik raised her concerns to her boss, saying she was worried about her safety and the safety of her other colleagues. She says he responded that she shouldn’t share her concerns with any coworkers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5POGU"&gt;Gjøvik went to the employee relations team and asked them to tell her boss to stop saying she couldn’t talk about workplace safety. Instead, she says they opened an investigation into whether he’d violated any policies related to sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQzZag"&gt;About a month later, they came back and said he hadn’t. When Gjøvik asked what her options were, the employee relations representative suggested she file an ADA accommodation request to continue working remotely after September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9p5IG7"&gt;To Gjøvik, the request did not solve her concerns about the physical safety of the office. But she didn’t have many other options, so she filled out the form, writing that she had “serious concerns about [the] workplace safety of my building and Apple’s other buildings on chemical release sites.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUIKPv"&gt;Apple told her she’d also need to fill out a medical release form that would give her records to Sedgwick, a third-party claims company, as well as Apple, Inc. Gjøvik said she wouldn’t do it unless the form was amended to say her records would just be released to Sedgwick, not Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jea8t8"&gt;She never received the accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8HEuN"&gt;Gjøvik was frustrated; she felt like she’d been keeping Apple’s secrets for years, staying quiet about mistreatment from her boss and team members, and now — when she had a real health concern — the team was telling her to stay quiet. So she decided to go nuclear: talking about her experience on Twitter and opening up to the press about what she was going through. A few of her tweets contained redacted screenshots of bullying comments from her teammates. One suggested Apple’s access to her work phone was inappropriate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;having resulted in her having to hand over nude photos of herself&lt;/a&gt; during an unrelated legal dispute years before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhGiAQ"&gt;In August and early September, both Gjøvik and Scarlett &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board&lt;/a&gt;. Gjøvik said she’d faced harassment, intimidation, and an unsafe and hostile work environment. Scarlett filed on behalf of all Apple employees, saying the company had been limiting their protected right to organize and discuss pay.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qWBTEy"&gt;
&lt;p id="LLEDbF"&gt;If Apple had a playbook for how to respond to allegations of discrimination and abuse over the last four months, it was “ignore the problem, say as little as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22VlkN"&gt;On August 20th, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;announced it was delaying its return to work until at least January 2022&lt;/a&gt; due to a rise in COVID-19 cases. Advocacy about the issue quickly died down as employees realized they weren’t going to be forced back to Cupertino anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6oAxFC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The firing is the first real sign that Apple executives may, in fact, be paying attention.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KClDy2"&gt;The company did start cracking down on non-work Slack channels. After the García Martínez letter, employee relations announced a series of rules that banned channels not related to Apple business unless they were part of an official club or diversity group. The rule did not apply to existing channels, creating a bizarre scenario where Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650751/apple-bans-pay-equity-slack-channel"&gt;banned a company-wide pay equity channel&lt;/a&gt; but left the #fun-dogs, #fun-cats, and #dad-jokes channels alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGtvUk"&gt;Then, on September 9th, Apple made its first major public move in combating employee dissent: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22666049/apple-fires-senior-engineering-program-manager-ashley-gjovik-for-allegedly-leaking-information"&gt;it fired Gjøvik&lt;/a&gt;. The company said she had leaked Apple’s confidential information in violation of her NDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yO3I7"&gt;The firing is the first real sign that Apple executives may, in fact, be paying attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbPWEE"&gt;Still, Apple likely won’t be able to stop employees from talking to one another. Too many of them have already met and started to organize. Some have joined non-work Discord channels to talk about pay equity and other issues that span Apple’s various teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72E1OW"&gt;It’s too early to tell where all this activity is going. Apple employee organizing is helmed by a relatively small group of workers, some of whom are burnt out and ready to leave the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5QOZe"&gt;There’s also the issue of internal resistance coming from other factions of Apple’s workforce. While many employees don’t want to return to the office, they disagree with how the activists have gone about pushing for change. After Gjøvik started to gain momentum on Twitter, multiple current and former Apple employees tweeted about how they were suspicious of her claims and felt like she was merely trying to get attention. On Slack, when employees talk about their concerns with privacy or a general lack of transparency, they’re often met with pushback from people who say they should have known what they were signing up for when they joined the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tk6SIB"&gt;To some employees, the bargain of working at Apple is to endure the hierarchical, secretive nature of the company. But to the workers who are pushing back, the question they’re asking is: does it really have to be this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29ivxQ"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch flags multiple types of irregular heartbeats, study shows  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nI4eE3YWBBmkd5xpULj_tMwBQ0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931094/akrales_171113_2119_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="btdYqJ"&gt;People who get irregular pulse notifications on an Apple Watch but don’t have atrial fibrillation — the condition the feature focuses on detecting — could still have another type of problem with their heartbeat, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIRCEP.121.010063"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwctQo"&gt;The findings show that even if someone with a concerning alert from their Apple Watch doesn’t get an atrial fibrillation diagnosis, they may not be in the clear, says study author Marco Perez, the director of the Inherited Arrhythmia Clinic at Stanford University Medical Center. “Even if you didn’t find atrial fibrillation, we were finding a lot of people who had something else that probably needed some clinical attention,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIkRfb"&gt;The analysis, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;, was done using data from the Apple Heart Study, which was designed to test the Apple Watch’s ability to detect irregular heart rhythms. It launched in 2017 and included over 400,000 participants. In the study, anyone who got an irregular pulse notification from the watch was sent a clinical ECG patch, which could monitor their heart rhythm over a longer period of time. About 2,000 participants got an irregular pulse notification, and an earlier analysis showed that around &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1901183"&gt;a third of those people&lt;/a&gt; who then wore an ECG patch had atrial fibrillation show up during that monitoring period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpZsC6"&gt;This new study looked at the ECG patch data from the remaining participants that &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; have atrial fibrillation detected. “If we didn’t find atrial fibrillation — what did we find?” Perez says. Around 40 percent of those people had some other type of irregular pulse, including premature atrial contractions (extra heartbeats coming from the top of the heart) and premature ventricular contractions (extra heartbeats from the bottom of the heart). “They had a lot of these extra heartbeats,” he says. “Those are things that we pay attention to.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apUjzJ"&gt;Cardiologists still don’t have a good grasp on how dangerous those types of frequent extra heartbeats can be, and often don’t agree on how or if they should be treated, Perez says. They’ve been linked to the development of atrial fibrillation and heart failure, but there isn’t a clear understanding of the best way to manage them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWmqT4"&gt;The study also showed that almost a third of study participants who did not have atrial fibrillation detected on the ECG patch said that they eventually went on to get the condition diagnosed outside of the study. So even if someone doesn’t get a diagnosis on an initial evaluation, it may make sense to keep an eye on them going forward. “We probably have to start thinking about the best strategy for following those patients over time,” Perez says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a63Ifo"&gt;Right now, there’s a wide range of responses to these types of alerts. If someone tells a cardiologist that they had an irregular pulse notification, the doctor might do a quick, 10-second check on an ECG in the office. Other doctors might send them home with a patch for a week. Still others, if there are other factors that make them suspicious, might want to do longer-term monitoring. The technology is still new and the approach is still evolving, Perez says.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsmnP9"&gt;Additional research will help refine the approach. But for now, this study implies that people who get irregular pulse warnings should keep an eye on their heart health, Perez says. “There might very well be something that is going on that could cause you to have an irregular pulse, and could be a sign of something wrong with your heart.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KY8K5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmhRf8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Backbone releases free adapter and 3D-print files for iPhone 13 Pro camera bump issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pTzJYYDGcJV2im_LTmgwbvwrlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913581/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hk174V"&gt;Backbone Labs has acknowledged the issue that hampers the use of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;excellent iPhone gaming controller&lt;/a&gt; with the new iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691301/iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-backbone-one-gaming-controller-accessory"&gt;As we noticed last week&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone 13 Pro’s thicker camera bump means the phone doesn’t sit neatly in the Backbone One controller, either sticking out on one side or causing the bridge on the back to slightly buckle. It’s not unusable, but it’s not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV1mXY"&gt;“We spent a tremendous amount of time meticulously crafting every surface of Backbone One (both bits and atoms) and even designing universal support for the iPhones available when it was released,” a Backbone representative wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Backbone/comments/pvhl98/backbone_one_iphone_13_pro_pro_max_adapter/"&gt;official post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we’re disappointed in the situation at hand. Several folks on the team even upgraded to 13 Pro Max for a better gaming experience, and while the fit may be acceptable for some users, it’s not as good as we’d like it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WquSRF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0nAvVr"&gt;To address this, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2Fadapter%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22695887%2Fbackbone-controller-iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-3d-printed-adapter" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Backbone has designed an adapter&lt;/a&gt; that is intended to improve the experience with the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. Ordering one will require the latest version of the Backbone app. Once you boot into it, you should see a pop-up that will guide you through the process of ordering one. Otherwise, you can open the app, then go to Settings, find the Help button, then click “Request Adapter.” It’s free to order, but you’ll pay shipping fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZFzsm"&gt;Backbone has also released open-source 3D printable files for the adapter, if you’d prefer to go that route. &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4977709"&gt;The files are hosted on Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;. It says on its site that “UPS offers printing services, there are tons of free local printers at libraries, and websites like Shapeways allow you to order prints to your doorstep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwUaUy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 30th, 8:42AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Backbone has added a support page that details the installation process for the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max adapter. Additionally, it has steps for Backbone One owners, both current and new, to redeem a free adapter or 3D print it themselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find your lost iPhone — even if it’s off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxmdXDJ2xj6wpidTTrR5CzNWgyg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925408/vpavic_4547_20210421_0021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJ0xk1"&gt;Apple’s Find My app has been a very useful (and reassuring) feature, allowing you to locate a misplaced (or stolen) phone so that you can retrieve it (or contact the authorities, if that’s safer). With the expansion of Find My to a variety of other objects, especially via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, it’s become even more useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMV5J8"&gt;And now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; brings with it the capability to locate your phone even if the battery has run out or it’s been turned off — if you’ve got the right phone — the utility of Find My has become even greater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECF20O"&gt;You will be able to locate a shut-off phone if you have the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hdzDEF"&gt;iPhone 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="83xhGf"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro / iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oFLhI1"&gt;iPhone 12 / iPhone 12 Mini&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XJvpcX"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro / iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EgrF78"&gt;iPhone 13 / iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BlZysq"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro / iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0gkbP2"&gt;You’ll know that this feature is active if, when you shut your phone down, you see the phrase “iPhone Findable After Power Off” under the power-down toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hv0yZ6"&gt;Activate the Find My app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="czJIfR"&gt;If you’re new to the iPhone or have never set up the Find My app yet, here’s how you start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zIfTal"&gt;Go to your settings, tap on your name, and then on “Find My.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LuzA3e"&gt;Tap on “Find My iPhone.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mIyfi6"&gt;Toggle “Find My iPhone” on. If you have upgraded to iOS 15, you can also activate “Find My network,” which will let you find your phone even if it’s offline. “Send Last Location” will send the location of your iPhone to your Apple account when the battery is about to die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turn on the Find My feature in your settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hEyLTj__UBAbTD4HpxYhdYbZFn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884575/IMG_49615EE7ED8B_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn on the Find My feature in your settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turn on “Find My network” to find your phone when it’s off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RNDYVuILGJl6ncQVRmWvCChpZxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884577/IMG_E77E43DD93EA_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn on “Find My network” to find your phone when it’s off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IAs1td"&gt;And that’s it! After that, if you can’t find your iPhone, then you can track it either by using the Find My app on a Mac (or another iPhone, if you have one) or on any browser by going to &lt;a href="http://iCloud.com/find"&gt;iCloud.com/find&lt;/a&gt; and signing in using your Apple ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WCkuy"&gt;If you’re using the web version, then you’ll see a green dot that locates your iPhone. Select the dot and then the circled “i” (for information), and you’ll be given the choice of having your phone play a sound, erasing it, or putting it on “Lost Mode.” In “Lost Mode,” you can enter a phone number where you can be reached and a message (“Please return this phone asap!”). After that, the phone will be locked until you reenter its passcode.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Find My app lets you locate your phone, send a notification, or erase it. (Note: the map has been blurred for privacy reasons.)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DtyCr1Ryk_qdHRUm_kBoMOlC5oE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884619/Screen_Shot_2021_09_28_at_10.10.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Find My app lets you locate your phone, send a notification, or erase it. (Note: the map has been blurred for privacy reasons.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XMD6QL"&gt;If you’re using the Find My app, you’ll get basically the same features (except in a more aesthetically pleasing form), along with map directions on how to get to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTXF7S"&gt;And yes — if you’re using iOS 15 on your iPhone, you will be able to locate it even if it’s run out of battery power or has been shut off. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Find My can locate a phone even if it’s off — as long as it has iOS 15 installed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Gh52_nYw0SlvCzEQB_hNMpsde4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884670/Screen_Shot_2021_09_27_at_4.50.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My can locate a phone even if it’s off — as long as it has iOS 15 installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SZblTv"&gt;(Note: you can also use the Find My app to help with your own security — to share your location with individuals and send recurring notifications of when you leave and arrive. You can find directions for setting that up in our article “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676312/ios-iphone-apple-location-tracking-turn-off-on"&gt;How to use iPhone’s location tracking&lt;/a&gt;.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPzGxS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 29th, 2021, 3:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add information on which iPhones can be found after power off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QN2OV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can finally rate Apple’s apps on the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucAA2Huwjoixhj4Wik797kZ8HK0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69927350/acastro_210831_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mzwh7q"&gt;For years, Apple has let you redownload many built-in apps from the App Store that you may have deleted, but store listings for those apps had a distinct difference from others: there was no way to leave a rating or review. That appears to have changed recently, though, as you can now review Apple’s apps in the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Q3gr"&gt;In a cursory, unscientific scan of some of Apple’s apps, many of them don’t have overwhelmingly positive scores. Files, Apple Maps, and Home all had ratings between three and three-and-a-half stars. Apple News is currently sitting at 2.3 stars. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/rate-and-review-apple-iphone-built-in-apps/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; observed&lt;/a&gt;, Podcasts has a whopping two-star rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fnx7HA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There aren’t a lot of ratings yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qWZKo6"&gt;That said, most of Apple’s apps just don’t have many ratings — many don’t break triple digits — meaning the current reviews represent an infinitesimally small sample of the huge number of iOS users who are out there. (To give you a sense of just how large the iOS ecosystem is, Apple said in January that there were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021"&gt;more than a billion iPhones in active use&lt;/a&gt;.) It also means that Apple’s apps have far fewer ratings than well-known apps like Gmail (347K), Facebook (1.1 million), and TikTok (10 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luPjyO"&gt;But even if there are only a few ratings right now, I still think the change is a good one, and I’m curious to see how ratings shake out for Apple’s apps over time. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to start drafting my review of Apple Mail where I publicly beg for a built-in snooze function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WYtdd"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can charge your iPhone 13 Pro Max much faster with the right power brick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OnfHZ51hQMWJc91fwiQdne0eQIE=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69927111/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="text-container"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro Max can charge a bit faster than other models, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byIt3SmVfyg"&gt;according to tests done by YouTuber ChargerLAB&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1441706758607552518"&gt;backed up&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/785/785771.htm"&gt;other tests&lt;/a&gt;), which show that the phone sips up to 27 watts of power when plugged into a compatible charging brick. If you have a 13 Pro Max and want to fill up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;massive battery&lt;/a&gt; as fast as possible, you may want to look into getting a 30W charger that, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205"&gt;tests cited by @duanrui1205&lt;/a&gt;, can charge it from zero to full in less than 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__aifbjt1xnnj"&gt;This appears to be an upgrade from the previous generation — &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/02/what-can-i-use-to-charge-iphone-12/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 12 caps out at around 22W charging speeds. That’s about a 5W boost, which is nothing to sneeze at. The benefit of a bigger charger is limited to the Pro Max, according to @duanrui1205, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1442424092238352396?s=20"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt; that the smaller iPhone 13 Pro could only charge at 20W. All of this goes out the window if you’re charging wirelessly or with Apple’s MagSafe puck — you’ll&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"&gt; be limited to 15W at most&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyzvo0"&gt;If you’re looking for a 30W brick to charge your Pro Max a bit faster, it’s probably worth looking around your house first: Apple includes 30W chargers with its new MacBook Air, and the 61W charger that comes with MacBook Pros could also provide the 27 watts your phone craves. You can check any other chargers in your house by reading the regulatory text that’s usually printed near the prongs — if it doesn’t outright say the wattage, you can figure it out by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#Overview"&gt;multiplying the amps and voltage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nMrhUB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10780536"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ADsxCo"&gt;If your search for a 30W charger didn’t turn up anything, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMY1W2AM%2FA%2F30w-usb-c-power-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F29%2F22700491%2Fiphone-13-pro-max-faster-charge-times-27w-charging-brick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple will happily sell you one&lt;/a&gt;. You can also find plenty of third-party ones, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Adapter-Compact-Foldable/dp/B091DS2M8X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s tiny Nano II GaN brick&lt;/a&gt;. One thing to note when looking at chargers is the charge rates they support — to get the 27W charging, the iPhone is looking for 9V at three amps, according to ChargerLAB’s video (which shows one 30W charger &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/byIt3SmVfyg?t=309"&gt;that’s only charging the iPhone at 18W&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 ‘unlock with Apple Watch’ bug fixed in iOS beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The buttons are unchanged on the Apple Watch Series 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v2L1cr9xo_3HsyPQNPHTY9v9Cs8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924432/vpavic_200929_4216_0111.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cYRrZl"&gt;Apple has reportedly fixed the issue that broke the “unlock with Apple Watch” feature on iPhone 13 models. The feature, which lets Apple Watch users unlock their iPhones without a password when wearing a mask, now works again as of the second iOS 15.1 beta, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/28/ios-15-1-beta-2-fixes-unlock-with-apple-watch-bug-for-iphone-13-users/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yH0EIC"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22694679/apple-fix-issue-unlock-apple-watch-feature-iphone-13"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; on its support page a few days ago that it was working on this problem. I’ve run into the issue myself on my personal iPhone 13 Pro and can confirm that it’s been pretty annoying after having gotten used to the feature since it was introduced earlier this year. Newer iPhones don’t have fingerprint readers, so the only way to unlock them when your mask interferes with Face ID is by using a password.&lt;/p&gt;

SharePlay, one of the most vaunted new additions to the OS back when it was announced at WWDC in June, missed the original iOS 15 release but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686897/ios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card"&gt;appeared in the first 15.1 beta&lt;/a&gt;. The feature lets you share music and video content over a FaceTime call. iOS 15.1 also looks set to allow you to add proof of vaccination status to the Wallet app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says the iPad Mini’s jelly scrolling isn’t a problem that needs to be fixed</title>

  &lt;p id="NhqQno"&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/2021-ipad-mini-suffers-from-uneven-jelly-scrolling-in-portrait-mode/"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it thinks the “jelly scroll” effect some users have noticed on the new iPad Mini is normal LCD behavior that the company won’t have to fix. The effect, also known as skewing, can make it seem like one half of the display is slightly behind the other while you're scrolling, and it’s most apparent while using the iPad Mini in portrait mode. &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn noted the issue in a tweet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt; of the device published this morning. Despite our requests before and after publishing the review, the company did not respond or comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cFw9a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; explains that the issue happens because the iPad starts drawing the lines on one side of the screen, and it takes time to go from one side to the other. A tiny amount of time, yes, but it can be noticeable depending on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3bKrD"&gt;You can see what it looks like below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="91zdci"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is is slow-mo video of scrolling on the iPad Min i slowed down EVEN MORE in a frame-by-frame step through. Notice how the right moves up faster than the left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In normal usage you barely see it, but every now and then it become noticeable. In landscape it goes away entirely &lt;a href="https://t.co/iq9LGJzsDI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iq9LGJzsDI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1440678843589689346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmPztH"&gt;If you want to see how LCD screens refresh in shocking detail, The Slow Mo Guys on YouTube &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3BJU2drrtCM?t=250"&gt;have done a video&lt;/a&gt; showing how it works with TVs and iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CW2ggO"&gt;Apple is correct in stating this effect is common in LCD displays. It’s very possible that the screen you’re reading this on right now would display the same effect if you &lt;a href="https://www.testufo.com/scanskew"&gt;loaded up a webpage that tests for it&lt;/a&gt; — my laptop shows it quite strongly. The reason it sticks out on the iPad Mini, though, is that it’s frequently used in alignments where the problem is most apparent — it’s not likely to be an issue on a landscape display where you’re scrolling vertically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCjgTe"&gt;This effect also happens with many video cameras, for largely the same reasons: if you pan fast enough, straight items like poles and trees will slant to one side, as the data is read from the top of the camera’s sensor to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lRD3l"&gt;While the effect is common (and subtle on the iPad Mini, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;we don’t think it’s a deal-breaker&lt;/a&gt; given how good the screen is otherwise and the inclusion of USB-C), it seems noticeably worse on this particular model than other recent iPads. It also feels unusual that Apple isn’t concerned about it while managing to avoid jelly scrolling on both higher-end iPad models and even my previous-generation iPad Mini (which retailed for significantly less than the new model). &lt;/p&gt;
