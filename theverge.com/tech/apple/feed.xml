    <title>Apple Maps is getting Google and Waze-like accident reporting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtWNC0gQEMm5GcFvR6PL5Xjx2WE=/0x1206:1125x1956/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68796027/IMG_0765.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new reporting interface in Apple Maps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q30Uux"&gt;Apple is bringing accident, hazard, and speed check reporting to Apple Maps. The feature is currently only available to users with the iOS 14.5 beta, and is similar to user-reporting features found in Waze and Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYYTge"&gt;When you’re using the feature, you (or preferably a passenger) can press a new Report button in the bottom tray, and select what type of incident or hazard you’re reporting. You can even do this using Siri: I was also able to say “there’s a speed trap here” or “there’s something on the road.” &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; shows that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/ios-14-5-apple-maps-crowdsourcing-accidents/"&gt;the interface is available on the CarPlay version of Maps&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NvL3Zc--eEWePqU07HjNzOa9tIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293645/IMG_0762.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Maps will give you a confirmation that your report has been submitted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aCK9Rw"&gt;This user-centric reporting feature is now something that all the major maps app either have, or have in development. While this feature was popularized with Waze, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18297146/google-maps-incident-reporting-traffic-slowdowns-waze-new-feature-android"&gt;available in Google Maps since April of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple is playing catch-up here (like it’s also trying to do by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/26/apple-maps-reviews-inhouse/"&gt;adding user-generated photos and reviews to Maps&lt;/a&gt;). It is worth noting, though, that Apple’s version has way fewer options as of today — Google’s, shown below, is much more in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LfGclGgagmAjS1sjUksREdVZQjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293639/IMG_0764.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s report interface has more options for hazard/incident types.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ao9Y7k"&gt;There is one strange thing to point out with Apple’s version, and it has nothing to do with the fact that the feature is in beta. You may have noticed in the Google Maps screenshot that Apple’s and Google’s icons for accidents and speed traps look &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;similar. Here are Apple’s again for comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DvjGNqgsx9ASjjnzPAyqPZsNdgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293643/IMG_0761.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are Apple’s icons. See the similarities?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Apple will replace these MacBook Pro batteries for free if they don’t charge past one percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="macbook pro 2016" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WYJ6M8zb7G-HS7NcdAjrOQH9BF4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795963/vpavic_161031_1256_0264.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Gf2uC"&gt;Apple has launched &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212163"&gt;a new, free battery replacement program&lt;/a&gt; for 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pros that won’t charge past one percent. The issue affects “a very small number of customers,” according to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubATdu"&gt;If your battery is affected, you’ll see a “Service Recommended” message when checking the battery health status. “If the status indicates that your battery is Normal, your battery is not affected by this issue,” Apple says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYZEOP"&gt;To get the battery replacement started, &lt;a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=kbase&amp;amp;PFC=PFC1002&amp;amp;category_id=SC0999&amp;amp;symptom_id=21085"&gt;contact Apple support&lt;/a&gt;. The company will examine your Mac prior to servicing it to “verify that it is eligible for the free battery replacement,” Apple says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FwcV1"&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, Apple released &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211896"&gt;macOS Big Sur 11.2.1&lt;/a&gt;, which is also intended to help fix charging issues with some 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pros. Apple recommends updating your computer to that or the macOS Catalina 10.15.7 supplemental update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66I8GP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satechi’s new tiny double-sided wireless charger can top up your Apple Watch or AirPods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3I9VG6bzyFFftIUQ3vvIaABic8I=/0x807:2500x2474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795913/2021_02_09_IMG3_rev1009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tFqHHt"&gt;Satechi has launched a double-sided charger that can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch or AirPods — but not both at once — while hopefully saving you from the added clutter of extra cables. The Satechi USB-C Watch AirPods Charger features a Qi charging pad shaped like an AirPods Pro charging case on one side, and a charging “puck” for an Apple Watch on the other. The charger is available now, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHP862ZM%2FA%2Fsatechi-usb-c-watch-airpods-charger%3Ffnode%3D6f80832709d8a1d4e23e62afc26e6bd967efaf3d026095ef053ef6420d01ba33e0519f86e06da9aae95ef04cdf8b699eb8cff6341b085f4e575fb9594093b692592d28f0091b18020b14c4e610d9eff984ab0c7d7d461aa297c93d0f5530363c70c9b854cdecbca8c4c8def9a47e39bf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F2%2F9%2F22275296%2Fsatechi-double-sided-wireless-charger-apple-watch-airpods#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exclusively from Apple for $49.95&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYvOCn"&gt;Satechi’s new charger has an aluminum build, white finish, and a small charging indicator light that fits right in with Apple’s minimalist product design. Because of the reversible nature of USB-C, switching between Apple Watch and AirPods charging only requires pulling the charger out, flipping it over, and plugging it back in. It can’t charge both your Watch and AirPods at the same time like some other charging stands or pads, but hopefully the compact size is worth the cost of that added convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UqgCCW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-McZg5c9xI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NVPC2W"&gt;Having a charger jutting out of your laptop or tablet of course has its own risks — I’d definitely worry about situations where it might snap off. Then again, Apple’s guilty of designing its own ridiculous charging set-ups, like it did with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9295901/apple-ipad-stylus-pen-announced-price-specs-date"&gt;the original Apple Pencil&lt;/a&gt;. Satechi’s not that extreme, and it definitely seems convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DFC4u2y-zQr47UDWi0jsPMh5lgo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293593/Screen_Shot_2021_02_09_at_4.40.51_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Satechi’s wireless charger can also be plugged into a wall outlet with an adapter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N0XWU9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will let Super Healthy Kids have a pear (shaped logo) after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1BEjI290elSYonW22XoKK2-vuCw=/159x0:1841x1121/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795553/prepear_apple.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Prepear logo, compared to Apple’s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OovfCc"&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360683/apple-super-healthy-kids-prepear-pear-logo"&gt;the routine story of a trademark opposition&lt;/a&gt; captured the world’s imagination, when Apple declared that Super Healthy Kids (yes, that’s the real name of a company) shouldn’t be allowed to trademark its pear logo because it might “cause dilution of the distinctiveness” of Apple’s own famous fruit-shaped intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95IjAz"&gt;Six months later, the case is now settled, and it seems Apple didn’t actually have a pear-shaped problem after all — because Super Healthy Kids has agreed to change the shape of the &lt;em&gt;leaf &lt;/em&gt;atop that pear, and Apple has agreed that’s good enough to let the trademark go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Prepear’s new logo has a half-moon shaped leaf, instead of the pointed oval." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dnS6ctgpIW5BGPdlEgIC1hh0KDM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293470/prepear_logo_change.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;USPTO&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prepear’s new logo has a half-moon shaped leaf, instead of the pointed oval.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kJpCoe"&gt;Apple has already consented to the settlement, according to documents &lt;a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91254886&amp;amp;pty=OPP"&gt;filed at the USPTO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53JGbX"&gt;“Prepear is pleased to announce that it has amicably resolved its trademark issue with Apple,” company co-founder Russ Monson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding that it plans to change its app logo in the coming weeks. The app’s website already features the new leaf. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PI6Xzqy7RB_zS-LqaRgOUY4J-wo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293434/Prepear_Logo_Old_vs_New_2021.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="seeBFq"&gt;Monson’s &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos/sign#:~:text=End%20Apple's%20Aggressive%20Opposition%20of%20Businesses%20with%20Fruit%20Logos&amp;amp;text=Apple%20has%20been%20opposing%20small,business%20as%20Apple%20at%20all."&gt;“Save the Pear from Apple!” petition at Change.org&lt;/a&gt; wound up getting 269,650 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nza0XE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CBS All Access will stop working on older Apple TVs when Paramount Plus launches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdgT-Fvws49JgbBeXlbcwOX4UJA=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795425/paramount_plus.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zmci8p"&gt;CBS All Access is set to transform into Paramount Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;on March 4th&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t be able to watch it if you own a second- or third-generation Apple TV. The company announced that it won’t update its app for those devices when the streaming service relaunches next month, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/cbs-all-access-discontinued-apple-tv-3-march/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cXFVpeUIiBjRGsh-uCYsIRKxg6s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293308/apple_tv_3_cbs_all_access_discontinued.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/cbs-all-access-discontinued-apple-tv-3-march/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Cgub6Z"&gt;The announcement makes CBS All Access / Paramount Plus the latest service to end support for the set-top box. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265965/apple-tv-3rd-gen-youtube-native-onboard-support-airplay"&gt;YouTube announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will drop support starting next month, while HBO dropped the aging streaming boxes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216451/hbo-go-max-apple-tv-third-gen-support-extended-april"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. The second-gen Apple TV is over a decade old (it launched in 2010), while the third-generation version was released in 2012, so it’s understandable that we’re starting to see a wave of deprecated apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rhg6z"&gt;Users will still be able to stream Paramount Plus to older Apple TVs using an iPad or iPhone, however, so they won’t be completely locked out of their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQAxuR"&gt;Unlike the more recent Apple TV models (starting from 2015 and onward), which feature modern software and an App Store that makes it simple for developers to continue to update their apps, the older Apple TV models generally only saw updates to individual streaming applications when Apple updated the entire operating system — &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202157"&gt;an increasingly rare occurrence&lt;/a&gt; these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWq7q9"&gt;The sunsetting of the CBS app on older TVs isn’t the only change the Paramount Plus transition is causing: &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/09/cbs-showtime-bundle-apple-tv-app-paramount/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; also notes&lt;/a&gt; that the company no longer offers its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372128/apple-tv-plus-cbs-all-access-showtime-subscription-deal"&gt;discounted CBS All Access and Showtime bundle&lt;/a&gt; for Apple TV Plus subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Fi VPN is coming to iPhones this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHjyVR3QpFeLXCVfxxRXgTYC8qQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793453/vpavic_4243_20201018_0154.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUjLLc"&gt;Google launched a VPN for its Google Fi cell service in beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18089834/project-fi-enhanced-network-vpn-privacy-google-announcement"&gt;back in November 2018&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Fi subscribers to route their phone’s internet traffic through an encrypted connection to help protect security and privacy. Until now, though, it has only been available for Android users, but that will change soon. Google plans to roll out the Fi VPN to Fi subscribers on iPhones beginning this spring, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi/google-fi-vpn-updates-help-you-connect-safely/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTUrSs"&gt;Google also announced that the VPN is officially exiting beta on Android. “After listening to your feedback and making performance improvements, we’re taking the Fi VPN out of beta for Android phone users,” Google said. The VPN is included with all Google Fi plans, so you should be able to try it out now if you’re a Fi subscriber on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x45ass"&gt;In addition, Google says it’s starting to roll out a new privacy and security hub for Fi users on Android. “The hub makes it easy for you to learn more about privacy and security features on Fi, and manage them with just one tap,” according to Google. “This includes the Fi VPN and other tools that protect your personal information and put you in control of who can reach you.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this Bloomberg story on how Tim Cook turned Apple into a $2.3 trillion powerhouse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At 2019 Dreamforce Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nqN3TEeX9S3C5UOfrEmz2dcA6JI=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68792737/1183490758.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uzis5m"&gt;Much has been said and written over the years about the post-Steve Jobs era of Apple and whether CEO Tim Cook’s operations-heavy approach to running the iPhone maker has proved more or less successful than Jobs’ at times cutthroat dealmaking and his obsessive, detail-oriented product development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNhZI5"&gt;It’s hard to argue now that Cook hasn’t taken Apple to all-new heights — the company is more valuable than it’s ever been, and the wondrous success of the iPhone over the last decade has allowed Apple to build hugely successful secondary businesses around the Apple Watch, AirPods, the iPad, and much more. But how exactly Cook, a logistics expert with deep ties to Asia and a much more measured temperament than his former boss, pulled this off is still a topic of debate — and the focus of a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-09/this-is-how-tim-cook-transformed-apple-aapl-after-steve-jobs?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;great new &lt;em&gt;Businessweek&lt;/em&gt; story from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman and Austin Carr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5UrwZ"&gt;In “Apple Is the $2.3 Trillion Fortress That Tim Cook Built,” Gurman and Carr recount how Cook managed the tricky balancing act of keeping Apple a thriving business throughout the aggressively anti-China Trump presidency and amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The piece also raises the important question of how Cook will manage Apple under a Democratic president and within a much more adversarial regulatory environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LITaky"&gt;It’s a great examination of Cook’s leadership style and one we don’t often hear about, as Apple still goes to great lengths to keep the conversation surrounding the company focused on new products. There are great anecdotes about Cook’s relationship with Foxconn founder Terry Gou, a relationship instrumental to Apple’s unprecedented overseas manufacturing ambitions that transformed the company into what it is today, and Cook’s masterful handling of the Trump White House and the former president’s obsession with optics. Go read the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-09/this-is-how-tim-cook-transformed-apple-aapl-after-steve-jobs?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;story from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s App Store is hosting multimillion-dollar scams, says this iOS developer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRMuVrltnfZKYSvIEWrK-dR5QdU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788371/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UakKY0"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou has a new calling that goes beyond software development: taking on what he sees as a rampant scam problem ruining the integrity of Apple’s App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7m4aTz"&gt;Eleftheriou, who created the successful Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType, has for the last two weeks been publicly criticizing Apple for lax enforcement of its App Store rules that have allowed scam apps, as well as apps that clone popular software from other developers, to run rampant. These apps enjoy top billing in the iPhone marketplace, all thanks to glowing reviews and sterling five-star ratings that are largely fabricated, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bfrJAE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Up to now, I've been in the "Apple *wants* to do the right thing" camp. My viewpoint is starting to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to spot a $5M/year scam on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;, in 5 minutes flat: &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938977748078594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zq0wOY"&gt;“It’s surprising more people don’t know about this. The extent to which this has been going on and is currently going on is absolutely mind-blowing,” Eleftheriou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;of the magnitude of fraud he says is occurring daily on the App Store&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;In particular now with the App Store, which is my main concern, the problem has grown to such an extent that having the rating and review system is making it worse. It gives consumers a false sense of security and a false idea that the app is great as you’re entering it through a glowing App Store page with raving reviews.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otnjzC"&gt;His vocal complaints, which have attracted the attention and support of countless other app developers in the iOS community, underscore the increasing tension between Apple and the software makers upon whom it depends. It comes at a time of unprecedented antitrust scrutiny and legal challenges from competitors related to the company’s stewardship of the App Store, from which it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to have made more than $64 billion last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpAAa8"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZkhTKG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The extent to which this has been going on and is currently going on is absolutely mind-blowing.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoaFRC"&gt;The issues Eleftheriou is raising are interlocking ones all stemming from what he says are inconsistently enforced App Store rules and lazy moderation. It’s not just apps that try to siphon money away from consumers under false pretenses using exploitative subscription services. It’s also fake reviews and ratings that can be bought and a broken algorithmic ranking system that helps these apps float to the top and take the spot of genuine paid apps developed by small teams or singular developers, Eleftheriou says. Letting it perpetuate, he adds, is a platform that Apple does not actively police unless it’s an issue that gains the attention of the media or involves one of Apple’s current rivals like Facebook or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEXORD"&gt;Eleftheriou first detailed his personal experience with App Store scams &lt;a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_161281136039111&amp;amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;amp;libId=kkwxug0j010023dg000DLc57hpt7i&amp;amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F02%2F08%2Fapp-store-scam-apps-how-to-spot%2F&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fkeleftheriou%2Fstatus%2F1356011069395755009&amp;amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;amp;title=Developer%20exposes%20multiple%20scam%20apps%20on%20the%20App%20Store%2C%20some%20bringing%20in%20millions%20of%20dollars%20in%20revenue%20-%209to5Mac&amp;amp;txt=thread%20began%20two%20weeks%20ago"&gt;late last month in a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, where he explained how his app FlickType was maliciously copied by numerous developers that built non-functioning versions of the software and charged egregious subscription fees, only getting away with it because of strong App Store reviews and high five-star ratings he claims are fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDyny2"&gt;Eleftheriou says his primary competitor, a scam app called KeyWatch, was charging users $8 per week and amassing more than $2 million a year, according to analytics from Appfigures, despite the app not functioning properly. He says KeyWatch even advertised its software using his promotional video — with his name still attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7onrML"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The App Store has a big problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.&lt;br&gt;Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/ &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDNC96"&gt;Eleftheriou has since embarked on an online crusade to bring more attention to the topic, fueled in part by Apple choosing to take down some of the apps he’s been highlighting but letting the developers behind those apps continue publishing to the App Store. Scores of other developers have begun chiming in with their own experiences, too, including notable Apple critics like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KZ5te"&gt;Some of these critics, including Hansson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;with regard to his company’s Hey email client&lt;/a&gt;, have accused Apple in the past of mistreating and overcharging developers using the App Store’s standard 30 percent cut of app downloads and in-app purchases. These critics see the scam situation as further proof that Apple profits off of these developers and therefore doesn’t take proper steps to moderate the platform and enforce its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kkilUu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The subscription scam apps that Apple allow in the App Store really are bananas. While they're busy hunting legitimate developers down for their pound of flesh, they're letting these hyaenas strive on the savannah unopposed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NpsjjWC0CY"&gt;https://t.co/NpsjjWC0CY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1358822574243905538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="S1tG5n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple refuses to take down two scam apps that destroy my honest business via fake ratings and false marketing claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have hard proof yet Apple ignores my numerous reports.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt;, please do something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my story.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppStore?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppStore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Appocalypse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Appocalypse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Scams?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Scams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/SCw9FHrN7g"&gt;https://t.co/SCw9FHrN7g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WatchChat (@WatchChatInfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WatchChatInfo/status/1358825883465904131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AqKXD9"&gt;Apple has yet to respond publicly to Eleftheriou’s claims, though the company has removed KeyWatch and some of the other scam apps he’s brought attention to over the past week. But the issues are systemic, Eleftheriou says, and nothing short of an overhaul to how the App Store ranks software, measures trustworthiness, and roots out bad actors will remedy the issue. Until then, Eleftheriou says he’s going to keep sounding the alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DP3h6I"&gt;“I’m not gonna stop. Whenever I see a scam, I’m going to call them out,” he says. “I just can’t wait for some actual proper change from Apple to make me feel like I should concentrate on what I should be concentrating on, which is app development.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zke3Gs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more users understand this is a problem, the more pressure there will be on Apple to act.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2FSGs"&gt;He says a competing app store on the iPhone could help solve a lot of these issues. That’s the same line of argument Epic has used in its lawsuit against Apple over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Epic and its chief executive, Tim Sweeney, have called for alternative marketplaces on iOS, as well as the ability for apps distributed through the App Store to use their own payment systems and not give Apple 30 percent of every transaction. After Epic deployed its own in-app payment system within &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last summer, Apple removed the app for violating its rules. Epic is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;suing both Apple and Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95KyD4"&gt;“In an ideal world, competition does have the tendency to sort a lot of things out, whether it’s pricing or enforcement of rules. Competition is like creativity; you get all these new ideas and hopefully the best get to the top,” Eleftheriou says. “The other way would be for developers to publicly share their stories as far and as wide as possible. The more users understand this is a problem, the more pressure there will be on Apple to act.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOAb8y"&gt;Eleftheriou adds that he’s disappointed in Apple’s silence on the matter, though that’s only energized him further to continue speaking out. “It’s not just acting. I think Apple needs to, at the minimum, say something, acknowledge the issue and that they’re working on it,” he says. “Just staying silent about it is just falsely reinforcing this notion for consumers that App Store reviews and ratings are to be trusted. They are not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYjouv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s former hardware leader reportedly now overseeing AR and VR devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/klMt9jF_kf-_Tow_QGka1g6QJgg=/0x0:1960x1307/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787831/Apple_dan_riccio_begins_a_new_chapter_at_apple_01252020_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5zoIYV"&gt;Apple’s former hardware leader, Dan Riccio, is now overseeing the company’s still-secretive work on augmented and virtual reality products, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/apple-s-riccio-shifts-from-hardware-chief-to-ar-vr-headsets"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Riccio &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249393/apple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new"&gt;stepped back from Apple last month&lt;/a&gt;, after serving as senior vice president of hardware engineering since 2012. At the time, Riccio said he would remain at the company with a focus on “creating something new,” but he didn’t say what that would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DSeCo"&gt;Mike Rockwell, who &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-19/apple-team-working-on-vr-and-ar-headset-and-ar-glasses"&gt;runs Apple’s AR / VR group&lt;/a&gt;, is still responsible for day-to-day development of these upcoming products, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. But Riccio reportedly has “ultimate oversight” of Apple’s first hardware to enter the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5n4AV"&gt;There have been reports for years indicating that Apple is working on AR and VR hardware. That’s been buoyed by Apple’s continued investments in AR on its iPhones and iPads, plus some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/10/14581428/apple-tim-cook-ar-vr-product-reveal-interview"&gt;coy remarks&lt;/a&gt; from CEO Tim Cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e22N1o"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;latest reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242131/apple-vr-headset-2022-fabric-design-fan-price-details-rumors"&gt;suggest that&lt;/a&gt; Apple plans to first debut an expensive virtual reality headset as a stepping stone on the path toward a more impressive augmented reality device. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that the VR device could sell for $3,000 and launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.5 lets you set Spotify and others as Siri’s default music service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6IeGHeKTTljO-afekPg5RDNRFY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787430/acastro_180510_1777_siri_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1bFUT2"&gt;iOS 14.5 looks like it will be packed with features, including the ability to use your Apple Watch to unlock an iPhone with Face ID &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;while you’re wearing a mask&lt;/a&gt; and support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;next-gen console controllers&lt;/a&gt;. But users who have already installed the beta discovered another great feature: you’ll be able to select a third-party default music service when you ask to play a song using Siri — including Spotify (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/ios-14-5-beta-siri-default-music-service/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGyfC3"&gt;When you ask Siri to play a song on iOS 14.5, you may be prompted to select which app you want to use to play it, according to a screenshot shared &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ldzar3/siri_asking_which_music_service_to_use_afterwards/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zfQAOhlEGHRcytTJd0XDUegcND8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289406/k04jlih7hvf61__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ldzar3/siri_asking_which_music_service_to_use_afterwards/" target="_blank"&gt;u/matejamm1 on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The menu to select an app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q5dm3P"&gt;I’m on the iOS 14.5 beta, but interestingly, the feature worked a bit differently for me. I asked Siri to play some Tame Impala, and I wasn’t presented with a list of apps to choose from, like in the screenshot above. Instead, I was shown a prompt asking for access to my Spotify data, which I allowed. After that, requests for songs went through Spotify without any prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVr5dy"&gt;Other users on Reddit have reported some differences in the feature’s behavior as well, so there may still be some kinks for Apple to iron out ahead of iOS 14.5’s public release. Because this feature is still in beta, there’s always a chance it could be changed or removed before iOS 14.5 comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIcQN6"&gt;The ability to set a default music app follows Apple’s welcome move to let users set their default mail or browser clients &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299342/apple-ipados14-default-apps-email-browser-choice-features-wwdc-2020"&gt;starting with iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;. You’re able to set default mail or browser apps in settings, but I haven’t found a way to set a default music app in settings. Maybe Apple will add that down the line. Still, having the option to set a default music player for Siri requests in this beta is a nice step forward. Here’s hoping Apple lets users set more defaults in future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
