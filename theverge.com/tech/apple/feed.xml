    <title>Hyundai and Kia downplay Apple car rumors</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E24ucx"&gt;After weeks of speculation, Hyundai and subsidiary Kia have again sought to downplay rumors and reporting that they are working with Apple on an autonomous electric car project. The companies say they are no longer in talks, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-tech-apple-hyundai-motor/hyundai-motor-kia-say-they-are-not-in-talks-with-apple-on-autonomous-car-development-idUSS6N2J9020"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/apple-talks-with-hyundai-kia-on-electric-car-paused-recently"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, though that doesn’t mean the discussions won’t reopen later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAjjot"&gt;Hyundai’s comments as reported by Bloomberg are essentially the same as what the company said last month in a statement that mentioned Apple before being confusingly walked back. The carmaker says it’s been discussing potential autonomous electric car projects with various partners but is yet to reach a decision. Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/apple-talks-with-hyundai-kia-on-electric-car-paused-recently"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that the talks with Apple had “paused.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJdq1t"&gt;Renowned Apple analyst Ming-chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;believes&lt;/a&gt; that the company does indeed plan to use Hyundai’s E-GMP platform for its first electric vehicle and use Kia for US-based manufacturing, though even then he doesn’t expect the car to hit the market before 2025. Whatever the state of Apple and Hyundai’s negotiations, then, the project is unlikely to be unveiled any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone modded a Game Boy Color to act as a much better Apple TV remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CIkCC-1sxHHqVasNJ5FBvs7Rq8A=/0x0:1908x1272/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68777610/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.31.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Otto Climan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BEyLzi"&gt;Most people who have used the Apple TV Siri remote have probably craved something that isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/9/21002605/apple-tv-remote-salt-swiss-tv-company-replacement-buttons-normal"&gt;so darn frustrating to use&lt;/a&gt; — but most of us haven’t modded a Game Boy Color to work as one (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-think-we-can-all-agree-that-a-hacked-apple-themed-gam-1846188094"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That’s exactly what &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYPw_wN1a9I"&gt;Italian YouTuber Otto Climan did&lt;/a&gt;, and while his project looks sleek as all get-out, it’s surprising how well it works using the Game Boy’s original hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0n0G3eg1f9fNxOvbMI9LHN3UUHk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284964/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.31.38_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow, that custom case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TssO1FdG6tIws3JyHjJJrtqOgWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284958/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.28.47_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That screen is looking nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xm04pU"&gt;First off, we have to talk about the case he used. It was apparently made by a company called &lt;a href="https://www.retromodding.com"&gt;Retro Modding&lt;/a&gt;, specifically for the project, and it looks incredible with its blend of ‘90s Apple and Nintendo aesthetics. (Embarrassingly, it looks better than the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin#/media/File:Pippin-Atmark-Console-Set.jpg"&gt;actual video game console Apple worked on in the ‘90s&lt;/a&gt;.) If you’re familiar with the Game Boy Color, you may notice that the screen on Climan’s looks a bit crisper and better backlit. In addition to replacing the case, he also gave the screen an upgrade using what looks like another Retro Modding part.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9FHNBiLgB59O0itxXlioWZ0F_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284966/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.30.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The IR blaster is actually original equipment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BfuHbs"&gt;Apart from giving it an incredible aesthetic upgrade, though, there wasn’t a ton of hardware hackery needed. The Game Boy Color comes stock with an IR blaster, which the newest Apple TV set still supports. Of course, some custom software was needed to map the buttons to the IR controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NEr1Abjrua0UfeHXIsdra6wv6ag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284968/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.31.56_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climan’s UI for the ROM is clean and minimalist. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lk1gmEZPqb71eTYwn2i_4lYnROw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284973/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.32.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the Game Pak is custom-made and beautiful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RG2xRSP5IjaqiGbp0P8cROb4dwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284987/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.28.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, there’s a time period-appropriate clear version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k0S2b3"&gt;I wouldn’t have blamed Climan for using a standard custom ROM cartridge, but of course he had one made that matches the Game Boy’s aesthetic. He loaded a ROM that he programmed with the Apple TV’s IR codes and button mappings, and there you have it: a Game Boy Color that can control an Apple TV. And because it has real directional buttons and not a feisty touchpad, it’s probably better at that task than Apple’s actual remote.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NOo1RW-RAN2_l4I_R0z30hboGT8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284983/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.31.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: a reasonable navigation UX.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aDSD6qHx9ldSYHpmfGz4UIA7ZxI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22285025/GBC_Remote_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I need this in my life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HkIrAW"&gt;While this project is absolutely incredible, I have an idea for the next iteration: using a Nintendo DS. That way, you can have the touch input if you really want it along with a microphone for Siri support. It doesn’t have an IR blaster or support for Bluetooth like Apple’s remote, but maybe you could add it in with the Game Boy slot, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero:_On_Tour_(series)#/media/File:GuitarHero_On_Tour_Controller.jpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt; style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A cappella group covers iPhone tones after nailing Windows sound effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bKzevVtcVPBYgBHjfk1tiPKV0LY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68776354/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_10.12.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Maytree&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bcS9sP"&gt;In January, South Korean a cappella group Maytree &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252590/maytree-a-cappella-group-windows-10-singing"&gt;wowed us&lt;/a&gt; with their spot-on vocal interpretations of Windows sound effects, and on Friday, the group released a video of their next impressive showcase: interpretations of sounds from iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxN6cO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1cMdXs6wG0"&gt;The video&lt;/a&gt; is a little over a minute long, and I recommend watching the whole thing, which you can do at the top of this post. They cover a lot of ringtones, including the familiar &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8rew3w8AbA"&gt;“Opening” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, the classic &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTcXZqIZxbA"&gt;“Marimba” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, and even the twangy &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/03YxoOwKxn0"&gt;“Strum” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;. (I should warn you that they also re-create the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48qVYSDur-k"&gt;blaring “Alarm” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, so be prepared to experience that brief moment of terror.) They even tackle some system noises, including the sounds of text messages being sent and received and a tightly choreographed version of the iPhone’s lock sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Nsbiu"&gt;If you haven’t seen the video of the Windows sound effects, you should take 28 seconds out of your day &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4AZB64VBJfA"&gt;to watch it&lt;/a&gt;, too. I think it’s even better than their iPhone video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFexPW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AZB64VBJfA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ek9xRS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"This a cappella group is scarily good at imitating Windows sound effects","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22252590/maytree-a-cappella-group-windows-10-singing"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NatG3O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install Apple’s watchOS 7 and iOS 14 betas so you can unlock your phone with your watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Oys7a8rhENrMJlvdvmrGbhE9Tg=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68775811/DSCF2033.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BkliOm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267230/apple-ios-14-5-watchos-7-4-public-beta-unlock-iphone-apple-watch-mask"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.5 beta is out&lt;/a&gt;, and with it comes the ability to have your Apple Watch unlock your Face ID-protected phone if you happen to be wearing a mask. If you really want this feature right now, you’ll have to download the latest iOS and watchOS betas — something that does come with at least a little risk, as it’s unfinished software. There are bugs, and features might change between updates. There have been reports in the past of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/81275"&gt;watches being bricked by betas&lt;/a&gt; (though I didn’t find any for this release). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeASH7"&gt;With all that said, I’ve been using the betas since they came out, and I haven’t noticed anything acting particularly buggy. So if you’re willing to throw caution to the wind to get access to the new Apple Watch unlock feature, here’s how you can get the betas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzBPL3"&gt;First, start by going to &lt;a href="http://beta.apple.com"&gt;beta.apple.com&lt;/a&gt; on your iPhone. If you’ve never participated in a public beta before, you’ll have to tap on the sign up button, and if you have, you can tap on the sign in button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IxEqZ489LyVm35Ji5D-koFz-3Cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284025/IMG_0732.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click the Enroll Your Devices button to get the beta profiles for your phone and watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YFs4A1"&gt;Once you’re logged in, tap the down arrow on the header, and go to Enroll Your Devices. I highly recommend following Apple’s advice to make an archived backup of your device, as iCloud backups won’t necessarily be accessible if you have to switch back from a beta. Apple explains how to make one on the Enroll page. Go ahead, I’ll be here when you get back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Qa3boUO7_j3-kTf89yr4uvJra0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284508/IMG_0720.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap the Download profile button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sCqqf2"&gt;After you’ve backed up your device, you can scroll down and tap the Download profile button, and your phone will let you know that you have to review the profile before it installs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pSN8H7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGTlEk"&gt;Before we do that, though, let’s grab the profile for the watch by scrolling up to the top and choosing WatchOS from the list. There, you can tap the Download profile button, then press Allow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W8Vlv1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322010"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sxIG2k"&gt;This will automatically open the Watch app, where you can press Install. This will reboot your watch, so while that’s happening, let’s install the phone’s profile by going to Settings, then Profile Downloaded. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3e7o03278GFVnxrpT-FLMJdgJmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284528/IMG_0726.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on Profile Downloaded to get to the profile install screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iw7qpK"&gt;There, you can tap the Install button, and your phone will restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w9zi7Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322014"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vn3r6v"&gt;After you’ve got the profiles downloaded and your devices rebooted, you’ll have to update your phone, then your watch. Unfortunately, you have to wait until the phone is updated before you can even start on the watch, so you can’t multitask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMLEZg"&gt;Once you’re officially running iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4, we can finally enable the unlock with watch feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n9cWI3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322418"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="huAMks"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Face ID &amp;amp; Passcode, and scroll down to the new Unlock With Apple Watch option. Toggling it will turn on the feature, there’s nothing you have to do on the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPijRY"&gt;Now that you have it installed, here’s what you can expect. First, and most important to note, is that your phone isn’t looking for &lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask, it’s looking for &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask. With this feature on, if my wife was wearing a mask, she was able to unlock my phone with no problem if I was within three or so feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVPWWS"&gt;Apple’s mitigation to this is whenever your Apple Watch is used to unlock your phone, it buzzes you with a notification saying your phone has been unlocked, along with a button to lock it. Pressing that lock button immediately locks your phone and requires a passcode on next unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mxCdLVK4REvsK6vr6V60O8Zvei4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284073/IMG_0716.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="csLdnt"&gt;With that caveat out of the way, so far I’ve had great success with the feature. I tried it with a variety of masks, and it worked with all of them for me. It is worth noting that, again, it is still looking for a face with a mask. This feature won’t help you in the situation where your phone is laying on the table and you want to unlock it without the Face ID camera being able to see you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKPueSpxvejY6raJasBWYsipG9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284083/IMG_0715.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fteXGe"&gt;Still, for me, not having to put in my passcode every time I want to check my grocery list while shopping is a huge benefit and worth what I consider to be relatively minor security trade-offs. The feature may not be for those with super-secret info on their phones, but for everyone else it’ll be a nice quality-of-life improvement, whether you decide to go for it right now or wait for the official release.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="uVn6y8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Pro with the new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best-performing laptops on the market in its price range. If you are interested in picking up the latest Apple laptop for a discount, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LLDSG?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a094004db35647d3a09744df30f88ed6&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604809-REG%2Fapple_myd82ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html%3Fsts%3Dpi%26pim%3DY&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F5%2F22268010%2Fmacbook-pro-m1-elgato-cam-link-4k-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731444302301797736" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the base model, which includes 256GB of SSD storage, for $1,199, knocking $100 off its usual retail price of $1,299. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjGD3B"&gt;This is the lowest price we have seen this configuration going for, beating its previous best-ever price by $20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fjlIAE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9715950"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G9fKSN"&gt;Elgato’s Cam Link 4K, which launched in 2018, allows you to transform your DSLR or action camera into a 4K webcam. At $130, it does not come cheap, and rarely do we see this product go on sale. But currently, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3FN5MR?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=fd6d91e9c05554176ca005fb5fa53c48&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the device for $107&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to pick one up at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731444337758520730" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for $109.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lnDjqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10321671"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U16VFm"&gt;The Lenovo Chromebook Duet was our pick for the best-budgeted Chromebook last year. At its usual price of $299, it’s not a bad option for people who need a device for on-the-go work. But if you are looking to save even more money, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725974043448883209" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has knocked $50 off the device&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to just $249. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MoScuS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Pz3Vx"&gt;Dell is getting a head start on its President’s Day savings. If you are in the market for a new gaming monitor, the company has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmpp%2Fproductdetail%2F7eet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F5%2F22268010%2Fmacbook-pro-m1-elgato-cam-link-4k-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32-inch HDR curved gaming monitor (model S3220DFF)&lt;/a&gt; on sale for just $400. Usually, this model costs $610, and it includes refresh rates up to 165Hz and supports AMD Radeon FreeSync. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new betas let you try its Watch-based solution for masked iPhone unlocks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="5G is great if you can find it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQz6gAtygq2U54E2N1oDRkh2qbw=/555x228:2040x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771975/vpavic_4243_20201017_0216.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fKHzoF"&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;upcoming release of iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4&lt;/a&gt;, Apple will let you use your Apple Watch to authenticate and unlock your iPhone while you’re wearing a mask. But if you want to try the feature now, you can, as Apple has released public betas for both iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luZbYl"&gt;Before these releases, people using iPhones with Face ID while wearing a mask could only unlock their phone by entering in their passcode manually, which can quickly become a hassle. But with the new updates installed, if your Apple Watch is unlocked (which it most likely is if it’s sitting on your wrist) and as long as it’s nearby, when you try to unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, you’ll feel a little buzz from your Apple Watch and your iPhone should authenticate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ronwMa"&gt;There are a few caveats to this feature, though. It only works for unlocking your iPhone — it won’t work for authenticating things like App Store or Apple Pay purchases. And you’ll still have to manually enter your passcode on your iPhone every once in a while as an extra security measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzSFvA"&gt;If you want to get the public betas to try the feature out, head over to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta program site&lt;/a&gt;. Note that you’ll need to install the iOS 14.5 beta first before you can install the watchOS 7.4 beta. And be warned that because this is beta software, you might run into unexpected bugs, crashes, and performance issues. Install with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is weighing an anti-tracking feature for Android, following Apple’s lead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7GqZ7rzl3eJHMMEzH_uM2rn3p38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770894/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OQOo4A"&gt;Google is considering developing an Android alternative to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;upcoming App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt;, a new planned opt-in requirement the iPhone maker will impose on developers that demands they ask for permission to track iOS users across apps and websites. The news, first &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/google-explores-alternative-to-apple-s-new-anti-tracking-feature?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, underscores the increasing pressure on large tech companies, many spurred on by Apple, to take more proactive measures to better protect user privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkP3j3"&gt;Google won’t say whether it is indeed working on an anti-tracking privacy measure for Android. But in a statement, a Google spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “We’re always looking for ways to work with developers to raise the bar on privacy while enabling a healthy, ad-supported app ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2S3M4"&gt;First announced at Apple’s developer conference last summer, App Tracking Transparency effectively slides a system-level opt in between an app’s tracking capabilities and a user’s preferences. If the user says they would rather not be tracked, there’s nothing the developer can do to get around that because Apple will disable a developer’s ability to gather the so-called Identifier for Advertisers code, or IDFA. That code both lets advertisers track users from one app or website to another for ad targeting while also helping advertisers measure the effectiveness of ads, such as whether a user ends up purchasing a product they saw on one app by using the mobile website of the merchant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vdCIpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s take on App Tracking Transparency may not be as severe&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CWkW9z"&gt;Apple intends to police developers using audits and other methods to enforce its policies, which include potentially suspending or banning apps from the App Store if a developer does not comply. Both Facebook and Google have publicly expressed concern for how Apple’s opt-in requirement could negatively affect their mobile advertising networks. But Facebook has gone a step further and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;begun waging a public relations war&lt;/a&gt; against Apple over the change by complaining it will harm small businesses and accusing Apple of being self-serving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNoHfl"&gt;Google’s take on App Tracking Transparency would likely not be as severe, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. Instead of forcing opt-in requirements on app developers, the Android alternative may resemble some of the upcoming privacy controls planned for Google’s Chrome browser, in which the company seeks to end some of the more insidious tracking technologies on the web today by developing less invasive alternatives and giving users more opt-out mechanisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf9YCA"&gt;Google’s work to develop new privacy practices and standards for the web is known as the &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;. As part of that ongoing project, Google has taken steps to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349538/google-changes-ads-data-cookies-privacy"&gt;phase out third-party cookies on Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and is working on tools that allow advertisers to target groups of users instead of directly targeting individuals. All of this could inform how Google develops an anti-tracking measure for Android, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple patent application imagines charging cables that might not fray so easily</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYm_3AqklTk6timJyw4xedSps0g=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770228/MD818.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Lightning to USB-A cable.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hx2l9U"&gt;Apple’s charging cables aren’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/30/9072323/lightning-cable-issues"&gt;exactly known for their durability&lt;/a&gt;. They often fray after a year or two and can even break down to the point where they won’t charge your device at all. (I’ve also noticed they can turn an increasingly sour shade of yellow.) But Apple is apparently working on some ideas to make its cables more durable, &lt;a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;amp;r=13&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;S1=(apple.AANM.+AND+20210204.PD.)&amp;amp;OS=aanm/apple+and+pd/2/4/2021&amp;amp;RS=(AANM/apple+AND+PD/20210204)"&gt;filing a patent application&lt;/a&gt; for a “Cable with Variable Stiffness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiL1Pb"&gt;The patent, first &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/apple-may-have-a-solution-for-fraying-lightning-cables"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, describes some different ideas for a cable that wouldn’t fray as easily. The methods would give different parts of the cable varying levels of stiffness, while keeping the cable uniformly thick. They would also replace what Apple calls the “strain relief sleeve” — the stiff cap you’ll find at the ends of many cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ht6xY5"&gt;The strain relief sleeve helps prevent the cable from breaking due to bends, which can be helpful since cables are often bent sharply near the ends to plug them in. The thing is, those sleeves often don’t stop cables from fraying anyway. Apple’s ideas in this patent vary the flexibility and stiffness across an entire cable, which would theoretically protect better against fraying no matter where you regularly bend it, all without increasing the thickness (meaning no more strain relief sleeves).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/auNqs7Z-JHYkSD3zXSKZEa_16Ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22281634/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_9.50.41_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A diagram from Apple’s patent for a cable with variable stiffness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Go8OWt"&gt;This is just a patent application, and there’s no guarantee that Apple will use this design in future cables. But the fact that Apple has filed this application is a good sign that it is thinking about cable durability. Hopefully we see some improvements down the line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s rumored VR headset could cost $3,000, feature 8K displays and over a dozen cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcokFbaWU9qlgedeKadPm7c-P3Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768503/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fao8AG"&gt;It’s no secret Apple is hard at work on augmented and virtual reality devices, with a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January claiming Apple is working on an ultra-high-end, pricey headset that could hit stores in 2022. Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sheds new light on what to expect from the potential headset, including a rendering — said to be based on “internal Apple images of a late-stage prototype from last year” — of what the device might actually look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otDr5Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s report corroborates several details from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s, including the fabric mesh material that the company is said to be using in order to lighten the weight of the device — and the high price tag. The new report claims the price could reach approximately $3,000, considerably higher than most other standalone VR headsets, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;the $299 Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxQvjR"&gt;The alleged design also appears to borrow cues from a variety of other Apple devices, including swappable Apple Watch-style headbands and a HomePod-esque mesh fabric. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEEyykaSpa2_RPdULlxgpgJj3aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280992/3b786602_c662_4696_b68c_21f89e4a4e95.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="soEngY"&gt;There are also new details on the actual hardware for the rumored device, which is said to offer both VR and mixed reality applications, thanks to over a dozen cameras (for tracking hand movement) and LIDAR sensors (for mapping rooms, similar to AR effects on the iPad Pro and iPhone 12 Pro). It is also said to feature dual 8K displays with eye-tracking technology that could offer resolution far beyond any current commercial VR headsets on the market today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1BTwT"&gt;Notably, the report claims Apple won’t be running the power-hungry 8K displays at full resolution the entire time. Instead, the device will use the eye-tracking technology to determine where users are looking and then rendering peripheral areas in lower resolution to improve performance (a technique in the VR world known as foveated rendering). The chips, as previously reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, are expected to be internally developed Apple Silicon hardware that could potentially be more powerful than Apple’s current M1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x2J91"&gt;Apple is reportedly experimenting with a variety of control methods, including hand-tracking and eye-tracking, a dial mounted on the side of the headset, and a “thimble-like” accessory, although nothing is said to be finalized just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tE5v9"&gt;The headset, described mostly as a VR device with more limited AR functions, is still intended to be a key step toward Apple’s ultimate goal: a lightweight AR device indistinguishable from standard eyeglasses. That device is still said to be years away from release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I love my weird Belkin wireless charging tree thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDB-gpLkUEmu3lrdmAmosYNnh4E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767462/DSCF7493.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qxoDeO"&gt;A $139.95 wireless charger that looks like a cross between a bonsai tree and the decor from &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; might seem like a niche product. But if you have an iPhone 12 and an Apple Watch, Belkin’s ridiculously named &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHPGA2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-boost%25E2%2586%2591charge-pro-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-magsafe-white&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22265910%2Fbelkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Boost↑Charge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charger with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt; is actually great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHeoqa"&gt;Charging Apple devices has gotten more complicated recently, at least for me. Now that the Apple Watch tracks sleep, I’ve been charging it with a messy cable at my desk for an hour or so when I start the day, instead of overnight. And while I prefer to use vertical wireless chargers so I can read notifications as they come in, the iPhone 12 mini turns out to be too small for most stands — the charging coil isn’t high enough on the back of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tN13sD"&gt;Belkin’s new charger not only solves both of those problems, it makes wireless charging a better experience than ever before. The tree-like design has two stainless steel “branches” — one on the left with a 15W MagSafe puck for the iPhone, and one on the right with an Apple Watch charger. There’s also a 5W Qi charger embedded in the base, which should work with pretty much any Qi device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="E175fr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Apple MagSafe Duo charger is overpriced and under-delivers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="69eALR"&gt;This is the first official third-party MagSafe charger, and I find it far more useful than either of Apple’s own options. It props the phone up at the perfect height for quick glances when you’re at your desk, and the charger’s base is sturdy enough that you can attach and detach the phone one-handed without the base moving around. The phone feels very secure either by itself or in Apple’s MagSafe-compatible leather case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xCbdZPmuI9xcJD6JpD91HKuWEY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280659/DSCF7495.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL1ffo"&gt;The Apple Watch charger works equally well, and I’m glad that something like this ended up on my desk instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple’s ill-fated AirPower universal charger&lt;/a&gt;. That device was supposed to charge the Watch as well as the iPhone, but it probably wouldn’t have worked with the loop-style bands I usually wear as they’d get in the way of the watch’s charging element. This solution works with all watch bands, and it’s much more convenient than fiddling with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="treFM4"&gt;The Qi charger on the base does what you’d expect it to. It’s ideal for low-powered Qi devices like AirPods that only charge at up to 5W, but it’s fine for Android phones too as long as you’re not in need of a fast charge. The base is big enough to fit larger phones without the steel stand getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQvjKo"&gt;My biggest complaint with this charger is that the power supply uses a barrel jack instead of USB-C, but it’s not a big deal for something that will never leave my desk. It’s still not for everyone, of course. You might reasonably think the design is too weird or the price too steep. I personally like the way it looks, though, and while it’s certainly not cheap, I think it’s better value than either of Apple’s MagSafe chargers so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKp3Nb"&gt;Belkin also makes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;similar MagSafe dock without an Apple Watch charger&lt;/a&gt; for $100, which is probably a better option for most people. If you’ve found yourself with my specific charging dilemmas of late, however, I can recommend the 3-in-1 version pretty highly.&lt;/p&gt;
