    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="02s40q"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F07%2Fapple-announces-documentary-911-inside-the-presidents-war-room-narrated-by-emmy-award-winner-jeff-daniels%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F8%2F22568985%2Fapple-tv-plus-9-11-documentary-presidents-war-room" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it will commemorate the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks with the release of a new documentary in September. &lt;em&gt;9/11: The President’s War Room, &lt;/em&gt;released in partnership with the BBC&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will focus on the 12 hours that followed immediately after the first plane hit the World Trade Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ED5rnz"&gt;The new film is directed by Adam Wishart, a British director known for the Channel 4 documentary about Somali warlords living in the suburbs, &lt;em&gt;Warlords Next Door&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;While an immediately less intriguing premise than suburban warlords, &lt;em&gt;9/11: The President’s War Room &lt;/em&gt;does sound like it might have gotten more access than previous retellings of 9/11. Apple claims the documentary features never-before-seen testimony from key parties like President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and Colin Powell, plus “nearly 200 never previously published photographs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmW5ug"&gt;Film and television focused on national tragedies are a grim business, with the promise of offending someone affected hiding around every corner, but they’re not wholly uncharted territory for streaming services. &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/the-looming-tower-hulu-review.html"&gt;Hulu’s &lt;em&gt;The Looming Tower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which fictionalized the events leading up to 9/11 and how government agencies bungled their response, earned Emmy nominations for some of its cast. Jeff Daniels, who's nominated for his performance in &lt;em&gt;The Looming Tower,&lt;/em&gt; will also narrate Apple’s new doc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krG4qm"&gt;Naturally, Apple also has its own interest in snatching up glossy, awards-friendly documentaries. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/26/21081221/boys-state-review-movie-documentary-american-politics"&gt;Last year’s &lt;em&gt;Boys State&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while unfortunately not Oscar-nominated, was a smash hit at the Sundance Film Festival, winning the festival’s grand jury prize before Apple snatched it up. Two of the company’s docuseries, &lt;em&gt;Tiny World &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Earth at Night in Color&lt;/em&gt;, have also been nominated for awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsM9SQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ndZckU4N8rhNAvTM3h79RZ4Q17Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525167/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hands-on with the public betas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RGStJw"&gt;iOS 15 and iPad 15 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;kicking off their public betas today&lt;/a&gt;, and after a few weeks with the developer betas of the new software, Apple’s OS updates feel like more of a grab bag of new features than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGHjhM"&gt;A major rethinking of either platform, this year’s updates are not. The two updates were clearly born in 2020’s norm-shattering pandemic. The feature list at WWDC and on Apple’s website wears last year’s remote-first influences firmly, from the heavy emphasis on FaceTime features to a better system for corralling notifications into “work” and “personal” buckets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCtoK8"&gt;Of course, Apple’s release cadence and insistence on major updates coming just once a year means that some of these features are arriving in what will — hopefully — be a post-pandemic return to life this fall. So it’ll be interesting to see how things like SharePlay, one of the update’s marquee features, actually shake out once people have the option to watch movies and listen to music together in person again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82OTUS"&gt;Other parts of iOS and iPadOS 15, like the overhauled Safari app or the new Maps app, feel like the kinds of more noticeable changes generally associated with Apple’s major software updates, but they’re sporadic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9D4var"&gt;The result is a software update that feels a lot quieter than Apple’s usual releases, one that — at least for now — looks to improve smaller things behind the scenes than rebuild things from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-YOwTs3Mxm7lXWTL3BFGCCtW8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689245/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iOS 15 homescreen is largely unchanged from iOS 14. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGKdwT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceTime and SharePlay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Nan3wn"&gt;The flashiest feature coming to the fall updates is SharePlay, a new Apple-wide system built on top of FaceTime for sharing TV shows, movies, music, and podcasts with friends and family even when you’re not in the same room. It’s also the most pandemic-inspired feature, an Apple product-based spin on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307583/watch-videos-movies-online-friends-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-scener-extensions"&gt;countless watch party apps and services&lt;/a&gt; that sprung up to replace movie nights over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="warmv9"&gt;SharePlay shows off how well Apple’s hardware and software services all work together: watching a TV show or listening to an album over FaceTime is seamless. But it also highlights the height of Apple’s walled garden: developers have to choose to use SharePlay — which is missing big names like Netflix and YouTube right now — and it only works on Apple hardware, despite the expansion of FaceTime and the Apple TV app to other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FEgxPx_dNvDn7GZ-gzLRUEouR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691037/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_10.11.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k8DJV1"&gt;And since content is streamed locally, everyone watching or listening has to have access to it, meaning that you can’t share an episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;with a friend who’s not a TV Plus subscriber, nor can you both watch the same movie if only one of you has purchased it from iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXcJ1T"&gt;FaceTime is also getting a wide variety of long-overdue updates that help cement it as a more viable video chatting application: a sorely needed grid view, screen sharing, a portrait mode to blur your messy background, and the ability to FaceTime with Windows and Android users (in web browsers) thanks to sharable links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGPKYn"&gt;These are all badly needed features for FaceTime, but they’re also the sort of thing that remains bewildering to have had to wait until September 2021 for, especially given the reliance on video calling over the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YfJml"&gt;Unlike SharePlay, though, the FaceTime improvements feel like the kind of thing that will remain front and center even as things start to go back to normal, although the Apple product focus and more limited feature set when compared to professional solutions like Zoom or Microsoft Teams mean that FaceTime won’t be making a play for business meetings any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tEy0Z1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZhK4nw"&gt;As is traditional for an iOS update, Apple has done some tinkering with notifications on iOS 15. Some of the smaller notifications are bigger now, and feature contact images — which might be the push to get people to actually add photos to their contacts, something that doesn’t generally exist in the real world outside of an Apple presentation in my experience. And apps that you care less about can be filtered to a new summary mode that’s delivered several times a day, instead of pinging you for each notification right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVieJE"&gt;But the bigger addition is the new Focus feature, and after only a few weeks of using it, it’s already one of my favorite features on iOS in years. On the surface, Focus is an expansion of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb feature, but instead of a blanket mute, Focus allows you to select specific apps and contacts to share notifications at specific times or specific triggers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wwnvgScnLVZ0lgi5r3_OifdHWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691389/focus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus settings (left), the expanded Do Not Disturb menu (middle), and Focus-siloed notifications (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7U7n"&gt;A “work” Focus, for example, can be set to activate when you’re on the clock and mute all notifications except from your email, Slack, and calendar apps, then automatically switch off when you’re off work. Focus modes can be triggered by specific times, locations (like when you get to your office or home from work) or when opening a specific app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="trNbrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Focus gives you real control over filtering notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRnXl4"&gt;So far, I’ve mostly just been using a “personal” focus for weekends and evenings to automatically mute any work Slacks and emails until the morning, which has been absolutely delightful. Apple’s machine learning also tries to learn from how you use your phone — for example, it suggested that I add a sports app I use a lot during “personal” time to the whitelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnjYef"&gt;And while Focus can be used in conjunction with Apple’s Screen Time feature, it’s not a totally cohesive system: for example, there’s no way to automatically disable work apps like Slack when in a “personal” Focus mode. It just shuts off notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qA9Ae"&gt;Focus also lets you assign specific homescreen pages to each Focus mode — including widgets — for even more customized experiences. iOS has also added the option to add duplicate icons for apps (so you can still have Apple Music visible on both a “personal” and a “work” homescreen, for example). But I’m a big fan of the feature, since it gives me a good reason to actually set up homescreens with widgets, and helps curb the instinct to tap the Slack icon when I’m supposed to be offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg2Joz"&gt;There’s also a new kind of notification to go with Focus and the morning summary feature, called “Time Sensitive Notifications,” which can override specific notification filtering features, so you don’t miss urgent alerts from your bank, for instance. Apple has specific rules for when developers can use these, but we’ll have to wait to see how they’re actually implemented when apps get updated this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eQJ6s9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safari explores a new look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sa-F42U9akLG4HUc8T5Q-CFoKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691391/safari.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Safari’s new design, with the rearranged URL bar.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mrCBnF"&gt;Safari has been entirely redesigned in iOS 15. In terms of material changes to iOS, this is the biggest, and it’s coming to what might be the most essential application on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP04AG"&gt;For the iPhone in particular, that means an emphasis on a one-handed design that moves the URL bar to the bottom of the screen, adds a swiping gesture interface, and a tab grouping feature (which is also coming to iPadOS and macOS Monterey). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ7LM1"&gt;I’m still getting used to it, even with a few days of use under my belt, and of all the additions in the latest software update, I suspect it’ll be the most polarizing. Over a decade of muscle memory has trained my brain to reach up for the menu bar on smartphones. I get Apple’s motivation in moving it to the bottom, making it easier to reach on the increasingly large phones it makes and putting the actual content of devices front and center at the top of the screen, it’s still a change that’ll require an adjustment period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qCUCdYYVSJw438QnZ8SDpmQE4lU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689246/cgartenberg_210629_4653_003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iPadOS 15 allows for widgets on the homescreen now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j5vaNa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad multitasking: what’s a computer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="luHkRC"&gt;Overall, iPadOS 15 gets a lot of the same improvements as the iPhone update. There’s a few iPad-specific features, though, starting with two major features from iOS 14 that were oddly missing last year: widgets on the homescreen and the App Library (which comes with a spiffy animation when you open it). I still can’t explain why Apple didn’t add those features last year, but they’re extremely welcome now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4rff1"&gt;Widgets, as expected, work even better on the iPad than they do on the iPhone, given the bigger homescreen. It’s not as big of a sacrifice to give up a quarter of your homescreen for widgets when there’s still so much extra space on the screen. Apple has also added even &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; widget sizes, the biggest size of which is roughly the same area as an entire iPhone 12 display when viewed on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Despite the massive size, Widgets still have the same functionality as they do on the iPhone, meaning that they’re focused on glanceable information rather than more interactive mini applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaF2Fz"&gt;Apple is also continuing to refine multitasking on the iPad with two new additions: a multitasking icon (three dots at the top of the display) that makes it easier to use the different split-view and slide-over modes it introduced in 2019, and a “shelf” that shows all the open windows for a particular app when you open it or tap the multitasking icon. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vQ2rbcsyuXVwyn4YZJjxh2girI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691086/IMG_0008.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking on iPadOS 15 is still... a lot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MbzDBs"&gt;The new multitasking setup is better, albeit still slightly confusing. Putting a single app into split view using the new menu punts you back to the homescreen to select a second app (or the same app again) to view in split-screen mode. Apps can be dragged and dropped when you’re in the app switching window to create new split-screen or full-screen combinations. The multitasking dots light up to show which app in split-screen is in focus, which is incrementally better than the bar from before. And swiping down on the multitasking dots is now an almost home-button-like experience, closing that app and letting you select a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ndrGX"&gt;There are still a lot of ways to move things around and arrange things and keyboard shortcuts available — so much so that Apple has a new menu when you hold the globe key to view system and multitasking shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqls37"&gt;But there’s still plenty of friction here. iPadOS remains unpredictable: I’m never 100 percent sure what version of an open app or app windows will open when I tap in on my homescreen. Just opening a new window is still an opaque process that involves dragging and dropping things around in split view. Slide-over panels still live in their own, separate confusing world. Split view is still frustratingly rigid, letting you have exactly two apps open with a third visible as a slide-over panel, instead of any other configuration (like one large app on the left and two smaller ones on the right). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8yAG2j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An iPad operating system with iPad apps — and that’s just how Apple likes it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MxrfpE"&gt;Ultimately, the new multitasking and split-screen views are a refinement of the older system, rather than some grand new paradigm for how to use an iPad. Those who like the iPad’s software abilities will likely find the new additions and enhancements to those modes nice. But those who were hoping that iPadOS 15 would offer a wildly overhauled windowing system — especially in the wake of Apple’s M1 upgrade in the latest iPad Pro — are going to be disappointed. Apple may do some additional tweaks or changes before iPadOS 15 launches this fall, but it’s unlikely to do any sweeping design changes for this update. iPadOS is still firmly an iPad operating system with iPad apps, and that seems to be how Apple likes things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3jMKY"&gt;Also new is a Samsung-like “Quick Notes” feature that lets users swipe up from the bottom corner of the display or hit a keyboard shortcut and scribble down a thought, highlight text on a website, or add a link for context. Quick Notes get saved to their own category on the Notes app, and can be accessed from other Apple devices, too. They’re useful, although like many iPadOS 15 features, it’s not something you’d likely figure out how to use without outside prompting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w8vdJA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best of the rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sRILU7"&gt;As is always the case, there are dozens of bigger and smaller features coming in iOS and iPadOS, too. Here are some of the more notable ones to check out on the public beta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKJ4ez"&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive part of the updates, letting you point your camera at any handwritten or typed text to grab a phone number or email address, translate it, or pull it directly into a text field. Apple has quietly made this a system-level feature — meaning that it’s available whenever you’re viewing an image, be it in the live camera feed, an image on the web, or directly from the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="7eJg3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cDWpCArz45zoW0gA6_K0S7khj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691400/text_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Live Text on iOS 15 can capture text directly from a photo feed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbDOvr"&gt;An interesting new addition on both operating systems is a new “Shared with You” feature, which shows photos, Apple Music songs, links, Apple TV Plus content, and podcasts that were shared over iMessage in dedicated rows within those apps. The theory is that if someone texts you a nice photo or their favorite playlist, you’ll be able to see it (and respond to it) in the Photos or Music apps. The feature is unsurprisingly entirely limited to Apple services for now, so sending a Spotify song to someone won’t appear in Spotify. It also might be overestimating how often users send links to TV Plus shows to each other, but showing shared links and photos are admittedly useful (at least, when the feature works properly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F8nIP"&gt;The Weather app has an overhauled design that adds a vertical, Dark Sky-style 10-day forecast and Dark Sky-style maps for temperature and precipitation. It looks nice. Notes and Reminders are both getting hashtags for categorizing and organizing, and the Memories feature in Photos is getting completely overhauled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHpcLX"&gt;Lastly, you can now put your Memoji avatars in outfits. I have no opinion on this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4gSsb6Ov3LMeV40ABqou9nGmF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691105/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1O7u7A"&gt;A lot of the other flashy new features are things we can’t test yet. Apple’s beta is only rolling out new maps to the San Francisco Bay Area to start (although it’ll be in far more locations when the final software is out this fall). IDs and keys in Wallet will also have to wait for broader support from state governments, hotels, and workplaces before we can see how those work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3fEA5"&gt;There are also a lot of features that will have to wait for third-party developers, like Focus statuses or SharePlay in third-party apps, which also have to wait for app updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MvxOuP"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V6Offf"&gt;The most notable thing from my time with the betas, though, is how easy it is to miss the newer features. Outside of the most in-your-face updates like the larger notifications or the new Safari design, most of the updates here are quieter, behind-the-scenes features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bVfAK1"&gt;They’re things that give you more options and ways to use your devices, but they’re just that — options. Focus modes are great for those who want to use them and integrate them into their workflow, but iOS doesn’t go out of its way to advertise them or push you to use them. It’s a mature way of looking at software, and one that’s nice to see, even if it means that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 aren’t the most exciting updates ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBtdHM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSDORv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; iOS 15 added the ability to have multiple app icons for a single app. This article originally stated that it was still not possible to do so. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ladies and gentlemen, a leather case for your MagSafe puck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ILxqlDEUnwChx43BVOb6jJg7F0=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69551329/856500010205_Lifestyle_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if MagSafe, but covered in leather?&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldz8wB"&gt;I’m not going to pretend to understand how product development meetings work, but there must have been something pretty special in the water when Nomad’s crack team of accessory specialists put together its latest pitch. From the company that was brave enough to encase your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111850/nomad-leather-airpods-pro-case-rugged-design-apple-accessory"&gt;AirPods Pro case in leather&lt;/a&gt;, comes an &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/products/leather-cover-for-magsafe-rustic-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all-new leather MagSafe case&lt;/a&gt;. That’s right, it’s a leather case for the iPhone 12’s magnetic charging puck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbQHjj"&gt;Nomad’s argument is that the case, which is available in either black or brown, gives a MagSafe charger “a classic, yet bold new look,” and that it makes the charger slightly bigger and easier to grip to remove from a phone. But it also costs $25. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R5zK_6fLsV4DWMd50ob2xCvu4eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699659/856500010199_Lifestyle_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomad’s expanded leather universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FVhHnC"&gt;As a tech blogger, I consider it my duty to maintain a base level of open-mindedness about new technology. But I also reserve the right in exceptional circumstances to point out when something seems just plain silly, and encasing a charging puck in leather is one of those moments. I can get behind the idea of a leather case for anything you’re going to be carrying around in your pockets to protect it from the stresses of everyday life, but a charger? A charger that you’re almost certainly going to leave plugged in next to your bed for 99 percent of its life? &lt;em&gt;Please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbVkJJ"&gt;If you’re already a fully paid-up member of Nomad’s expanded leather universe, and you’ve already got a leather case for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176171/nomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287731/nomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111850/nomad-leather-airpods-pro-case-rugged-design-apple-accessory"&gt;your AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394331/apple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin"&gt;your AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, then sure, why not also cocoon your MagSafe charger in leather for the hell of it. Maybe try following our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357436/how-to-patina-iphone-x-leather-case-saddle-brown-processor"&gt;exhaustive guide to getting a nice patina&lt;/a&gt; on your leather accessories while you’re at it. You’ve earned it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google crowd out the competition with default apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-BajpgSWY_z9XLxnIOLTmw66pc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550154/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new study shows how Apple and Google’s preinstalled apps dominate their mobile platforms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wJfzM4"&gt;If you use an iPhone or Android phone, chances are the majority of your most-used apps were made by Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysNYXF"&gt;That’s the takeaway from a new Comscore study that ranks the popularity of preinstalled iOS and Android apps, such as Apple’s Messages, alongside apps made by other developers. The results show that the majority of apps people use on their phones in the US come preinstalled by either Apple or Google. The first-of-its-kind report was commissioned by Facebook, one of Apple’s loudest critics, and shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHrZWT"&gt;Preinstalled services dominate when it comes to basics like weather, photos, and clocks, according to the report, suggesting these categories will be difficult for other apps to compete in. Defaults don’t win out exclusively, though: Apple Maps and Music don’t appear on the iOS list at all, and Gmail makes the iOS list several entries below Apple Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c5cAMz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for favoring their own services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzYrnI"&gt;The timing, as Facebook likely intentioned, is apt: Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for how they favor their own services over competitors like Spotify. US lawmakers are currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;reviewing a new set of bills&lt;/a&gt; designed to curb the power of Big Tech, including legislation that could potentially bar Apple and Google from giving their services the upper hand against rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvTGa"&gt;The pushback stems from how Apple and Google bundle their apps and services with their mobile operating systems in ways that some of their competitors think is unfair. The criticism is harsher against Apple, given that it more tightly controls the apps that come preinstalled on the iPhone and doesn’t allow developers to circumvent its App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzrZxb"&gt;At the same time, it has been difficult to know how popular these preinstalled apps are relative to apps made by third-party developers since Apple and Google don’t disclose user numbers for their default apps. Research firms regularly track the popularity of apps that are available for download in app stores, but Comscore’s study is the first real attempt at charting how default mobile apps compete against other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TCKt1W"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/6523915"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tknLNo"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22313379"&gt;full interactive version here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9sO-_nhMbJmafmbNBALEFxq300A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702366/VRG_Data_Top20Apps_BarChart_Vert2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CDcIg6"&gt;To make the report last December, Comscore used data it regularly gathers from apps and websites alongside a survey of roughly 4,000 people asking about the default apps they used during the month of November. The results show that 75 percent of the top 20 apps on iOS in the US were made by Apple, while Google made 60 percent of the top apps on Android. The top four apps on both platforms were made by their respective parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hheye"&gt;Facebook is the only outside developer with more than one app on the iOS list and the only developer with three apps on the list for Android. Randomly, a staggering 78 million people used Apple’s Calculator app — more than the users of Gmail on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcH7KS"&gt;Facebook paid for the Comscore study to show the “impact of preinstalled apps on the competitive app ecosystem,” according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The social network’s executives have long criticized Apple’s limitations on third-party developers for hindering their ability to distribute mobile games and compete effectively with iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iJJVIt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple called the report “seriously flawed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBAsdA"&gt;Apple rejected the report’s findings. “This Facebook-financed survey from December 2020 was narrowly tailored to give the false impression that there’s little competition on the App Store,” an Apple spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In truth, third-party apps compete with Apple’s apps across every category and enjoy large scale success.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXdn9R"&gt;The spokesperson said the survey’s methodology was “seriously flawed in a number of ways” and that the results contradicted Comscore’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings#tab_mobile_apps/"&gt;April 2021 rankings&lt;/a&gt; on app usage. But those rankings didn't attempt to factor in the usage of all preinstalled apps like the Facebook-commissioned study did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVl9oD"&gt;Google did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MknSY7"&gt;Besides Comscore showing app usage in the US for a particular window of time, there are a couple of other quirks in its methodology to note: it did not include browsers such as Apple’s Safari or Google’s Chrome in the rankings or what it calls “embedded operating system features” like Siri. And results for Android weren’t gathered by specific phone manufacturers, meaning app usage isn’t broken out for Samsung phones relative to the Google Pixel, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="05S9u9"&gt;Still, the report points to the power platform owners have over what apps are used on their devices. It’s not just the app stores that serve as gatekeepers, but the phones themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS 101: how to force quit a Mac app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nm-CwgHR_wOY-d-ceXSgL4epemc=/0x34:1058x739/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547450/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_2.08.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oTrMbb"&gt;Apps on macOS are usually well-behaved, but there are times when they can stop working or freeze and slow down your entire Mac. If that happens to you (and it might happen often if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"&gt;playing with the latest Monterey betas&lt;/a&gt;), it’s time to quit the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu7SMu"&gt;The first thing to do, of course, is try to quit the app normally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="224zXf"&gt;Right-click on the app’s icon in the menu bar and select “Quit,” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="33lfCZ"&gt;Press the Command-Q keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DdcZYn"&gt;However, if the app is frozen or just won’t go away, then you need to force a quit. Again, there are a couple of ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LYQa97"&gt;Click on the Apple icon in the top-left corner and look for a choice that says “Force Quit” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lpmgTD"&gt;Press Command-Option-Esc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You may be able to find “Force Quit” in the Apple drop-down menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGxWEJCREgbEqgl5I-HhcupWLPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701867/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.51.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may be able to find “Force Quit” in the Apple drop-down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="byeFag"&gt;Either way, this will bring up the “Force Quit Applications” box, which will have a list of currently active apps. Highlight the troublesome app, and click on the “Force Quit” button. A pop-up will ask if you’re sure; click on “Force Quit” to finally quit the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Use the “Force Quite Applications” menu to shut down an erring app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yedHKjJbMVDbcF4Rv0fbv4N4JeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701870/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.51.30_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use the “Force Quite Applications” menu to shut down an erring app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XHmqw7"&gt;If for any reason you can’t access the “Force Quit” menu, there is another way to quit the app using the Activity Monitor, which lists all of the active processes on your Mac. To get to the Activity Monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rF7rhW"&gt;Use Spotlight Search to find “Activity Monitor,” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4X1teS"&gt;In your Finder, click on Applications in the left-hand menu. In the resulting list of apps, double-click on Utilities to open the folder, and then double-click on Activity Monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll find Activity Monitor in the Applications Utility folder." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvDa75zQOI0DwTY5DW0vxkRhhz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701873/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_11.56.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll find Activity Monitor in the Applications’ Utility folder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="FZwqc2"&gt;You’ll see a list of active processes, which should include your misbehaving app. It’s going to be a long list, so you can click on the “Process Name” heading to alphabetize the list for an easier find. If you suspect that the app is stressing your CPU, you might try clicking on the “% CPU” heading, which may put the app at the top of the list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you’ve found the app, click the “x” icon at the top of the list." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CMmuCURZUgQZz6vrf9_GYtYx94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701874/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_11.57.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’ve found the app, click the “x” icon at the top of the list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Nt5G6I"&gt;Highlight the app you want to quit, and click on the “x” icon at the top of the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QzaPws"&gt;Click on “Force Quit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you can either quit or force quit the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbRG3yXrKPupi5QFry73TVRQz_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701875/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_12.03.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can either quit or force quit the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kBldLk"&gt;And if you’re still having difficulties, you can always shut down your system. You may lose some of what you’re currently working on, but it will close the app that’s driving you nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="368Xap"&gt;Hold down your power button (or the Touch ID button if your Mac has a Touch Bar) until you see the Apple logo on your display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vFZxsK"&gt;Let go, and allow the system to restart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uA3HUE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avlTqC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rep. Ken Buck is the new face of Republican antitrust</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mvvADHQsCpRnBsMa6yonMWghE5Y=/0x1:2039x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69545202/lswall_210630_4654_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Meet the Republican behind the House’s bipartisan antitrust deal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XvYWU2"&gt;In Congress, pretty much everything moves at a glacial pace. But legislation targeting the market power of large tech companies is picking up an unusual amount of bipartisan momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JNGHV"&gt;After nearly two years of investigations into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, the House Judiciary Committee pushed through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;a package of six bills&lt;/a&gt; last month that would force these companies to unwind anti-competitive mergers and make the data they obtain on users more portable, in an effort to spur greater competition in the market. The package was surprising in its size and scope, but even more surprising — it was bipartisan. Colorado Rep. Ken Buck, the top Republican on the antitrust subcommittee, played a large role in building that coalition, which has put him at the leading edge of Republican tech policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjrWFV"&gt;On June 30th, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; met with Buck in his office on Capitol Hill for a brief interview in between House floor votes. We discussed last month’s markup, the congressman’s relationship with the rest of the Republican caucus, and how he’s “very lonely” up in his office where tech lobbyists purportedly refuse to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm1YJC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfSQyV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your initial reaction to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549025/big-tech-antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google-house-judiciary-jim-jordan"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last month’s markup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XMdxT"&gt;Tired, tired. Twenty-nine hours was a lot of time. I thought there were some really good ideas. And as I said from the beginning, this is a starting point and this is how the legislative process should work. We did an 18-month investigation. We drafted bills. We floated them to members. We filed them. They were available to members. In fact, I sent them to all the Republican members on the committee. And then we moved forward with a process with people who had different ideas. I thought it was a very positive process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKj3Sh"&gt;Some of the ideas were just poison pills that were designed to cause division, but most of the ideas proposed in amendments were really positive, and those bills will change again before they hit the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZG0up"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last year, you authored your “Third Way” report detailing the ways in which you disagreed with the majority’s solutions. Can you describe your evolution from authoring that report to supporting the Democrat-led measures last month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8O6ctc"&gt;The bills we presented take a scalpel to the issues that are necessary. What we’re trying to do is slow the monopolization of these four companies in the marketplace to encourage competition. We required the burden to flip on mergers which would slow down the growth of these companies, but at the same time we talk about portability and other things that would encourage competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TrtKPpBqhWqMIGjjIEuKPEW4Sy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22695909/lswall_210630_4654_0021.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SIKTpk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking back from the investigation and pushing for this effort to be bipartisan, what were those conversations with members like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q7jqc"&gt;My evolution from the very beginning was that the market will take care of this. Throughout the investigation, I saw how these companies are acting. I was very concerned and I realized we need to do something. But we don’t want to have the unintended consequence of shutting down the economy and hurting airlines and banks and all the other sectors that do have competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6BEwL"&gt;I think the bills are consistent with the Third Way report. But I also said, I’m opposed to overturning the American Express case. I pointed out some areas that I thought were bad policy in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOiyGf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We heard from Speaker Pelosi that she supports the measures and wants to move forward. But a couple days later, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said that they need more work. How long do you see this process taking and what needs to get done to prepare these bills for the floor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DfsCd"&gt;We take the ideas from the members in the markup. We work on the bills and probably after the August recess, we send the bills out to members again. And those will be managers’ amendments that will move forward with the floor vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3kDPQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the markup, we saw some California Democrats oppose the bills over privacy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ap7cCW"&gt;And the California Republicans, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umnyaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do you think privacy has a place in these bills?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCgCNO"&gt;Yes. The Section 230 censorship issues are under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The issue of privacy, I think in some areas, is in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The way to encourage privacy is to have competition in the marketplace and allow competitors like DuckDuckGo to say they won’t sell our data and you can choose to use that search engine. Or you can use Google’s search engine, and on page 23 of their user agreement, you can agree to allow them to sell your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwOwsh"&gt;The consumers will demand that privacy be taken into account, and some of them don’t care. Some of them do, but the marketplace will address these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIKOMt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It sounds like you agree that privacy is a competition issue. How do you include language in these bills to implement stronger privacy protections?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFrnbc"&gt;How do you implement that? That’s the problem. You don’t want government coming in and saying this kind of speech is not something that you can sell. There is cybersecurity privacy, where we absolutely want to protect from Russian hackers or whoever’s out there. But there’s also the privacy an individual decides to give up. That’s an individual right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="otQ2Am"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What Big Tech wants is to run the clock”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UaDkDY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve mentioned in the past that these bills are just the first step in taking on Big Tech. Many members of your caucus seem to disagree. I listened to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) try to force Section 230 reforms into these bills. How do you plan to meet these requests from other members as you move forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzRrqC"&gt;Section 230 is another committee and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) is working on that. I think that Jim has a lot of good ideas that I will support, but they just don’t belong in these bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fvgtb"&gt;The Democrats aren’t going to pass these 230 reforms. The Republicans who are opposed to these bills want to add it to the bill so the Dems don’t vote for it. And that’s not going to happen. What Big Tech wants is to run the clock. If they can get to the end of this Congress and if Republicans are in charge who don’t like these bills, these bills will never hit the floor. This is the opportunity to get this passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="888Azg"&gt;Jim has been a hero of mine for years, and I love the guy. We disagree about an issue. I don’t go to motive at all with Jim. I just think he and I see this issue differently. He’s been very respectful of me and in different groups that we’ve talked in and I try to be as respectful as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5Cw7v2Q5MBwss7YmWyf3uDpKOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22695904/lswall_210630_4654_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NONIKO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see these moving forward in the Senate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIotLJ"&gt;The likelihood is that you get most Democrats and some Republicans to get over that 60-vote margin. I think there will be some Republican opposition in the Senate. I actually think the Senate works much better in terms of collegial communication than the House does. They’ll be working through these issues in a healthy way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnEmrz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you’re optimistic we’ll see these bills approved over the next few years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMCMSD"&gt;I’m optimistic, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cAh7b2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m very lonely”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rd5FAT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the lobbying effort been like with these big tech companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hE9Cvp"&gt;I hear secondhand what it’s like. Nobody bothers coming in and talking to me. I’m very lonely. I love interviews like this because the reality is that the Big Tech people know this is not a friendly forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0Rg3V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your take on the court throwing out the Federal Trade Commission’s complaint against Facebook last week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSwtov"&gt;It indicates that there is even greater need for the definition of market than there previously was. The judge said in the opinion that it’s easy to define what the tobacco market is. It’s harder to define what the Facebook market is. And the FTC hasn’t done that. So these bills have a definition in place that would address that very issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWM5UM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your opinion on Lina Khan? She’s already moving forward with an aggressive antitrust agenda as FTC chair, and the conservative commissioners seem to think she’s overreaching.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrZkCx"&gt;The challenge is she doesn’t have a voting record. It’s hard to identify her in any particular group, which is good and bad. I look forward to working with her. I’ve had conversations with her. I think she is supportive of what we’re trying to do here. I have stressed in conversations that it’s essential that the FTC work in a bipartisan manner to reinforce the bipartisanship that’s coming out of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj1pX7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the FTC and the Justice Department will be strong enough to take on these companies without this legislation being passed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="K6B6Ml"&gt;Updating laws that are more than 100 years old is really important. We have to amend the laws to appropriately address this issue. The lightbulb hadn’t even been invented when the Sherman Act was passed in 1888. To think that you can click on a computer screen and get something delivered the next day is completely different. The laws have to be updated in order for law enforcement to be effective. It’s a constitutional issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcYxiq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V489p8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kensington’s StudioCaddy is a home for all your Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rycBrR7aOwJrl9DuitSd79rka5U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69544950/DSCF7728_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The StudioCaddy has USB-A and USB-C charging ports on the side.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwwjSr"&gt;Following the recent release of the StudioDock, an opulent stand that turns the iPad Pro into a mini desktop computer, Kensington is expanding its Apple-focused offerings today with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-StudioCaddy-Wireless-Charging-K59090WW/dp/B094Q4XNG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$179.99 StudioCaddy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an unusual product with a simple goal: it’s meant to be the place where all your Apple devices can live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnRsii"&gt;The StudioCaddy is comprised of two halves that attach magnetically. The first half is a basic metal stand that you can slot a closed MacBook into, and there’s also a rubberized shelf out front designed to hold an iPad. The second half attaches onto the front and includes two Qi wireless chargers, one vertical for an iPhone and one horizontal with a recess that you can put an AirPods case into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OaHm9J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hu7DlM"&gt;You could, of course, use the StudioCaddy with many combinations of Windows ultrabook, Android tablet and phone, and Qi-equipped wireless earbuds. Kensington is focusing on the Apple ecosystem, though — the product’s full name is actually “StudioCaddy with Qi Wireless Charging for Apple Devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXi8ru"&gt;The StudioCaddy feels very well built, and each stand is sturdy enough not to get knocked around a desk. The wireless charging stand also has USB-C and USB-A ports for extra power, providing up to 20W over USB-C — enough to charge an iPad (but not a MacBook Pro) reasonably quickly, or even an Apple Watch if you want to complete the set. That’s useful, although the external AC adapter is a little bulkier than I’d prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcNyZH"&gt;While I’ve found many vertical Qi chargers don’t work with my iPhone 12 Mini, Kensington has included a swappable part that lifts the phone to raise its wireless charging coils to the right level. It’s also recommended for use with smaller phones like the iPhone SE or the 11 Pro, though I found various larger Android devices would also charge just fine with it in place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0k8GSB6lgerRCT9b2dvTboX7sQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22700978/DSCF7727_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The StudioCaddy is designed to hold a MacBook and iPad while wirelessly charging an iPhone and AirPods.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HVa9ll"&gt;The main idea with the StudioCaddy is that you can save a lot of desk space by storing all your Apple devices in the same place. In practice, though, I’m not sure that people would need their iPhone charger to be attached to their laptop. Until recently I almost always used my MacBook Pro in “clamshell” mode on another stand, and I put it out of the way to save space, which the StudioCaddy does well. But I’d rather have the iPhone charging in front of me at my desk so I can see notifications coming in, so the benefit of the all-in-one approach is mostly lost on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh5KY6"&gt;If your desk setup allows it, which mine does not, it could be neat to put the StudioCaddy next to your monitor with your phone facing you and your MacBook in clamshell mode. That’s quite a lot of horizontal space to give up, however. You could also just use the StudioCaddy’s two halves independently of one another, and then you’d be left with a good wireless charger and a good MacBook/iPad stand. But there are lots of other options out there for both of those use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL3UUb"&gt;You know your own desk situation better than I do, and I can recommend the StudioCaddy if you think it’d be a decent fit. It’s a well-made, versatile product that does what it sets out to do, and most people with a lot of Apple devices could probably make good use out of it. It’s not cheap, though, so you’d have to be sure it was a better option for you than replicating all the functionality with separate products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAyPeN"&gt;The StudioCaddy will be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-StudioCaddy-Wireless-Charging-K59090WW/dp/B094Q4XNG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to order&lt;/a&gt; from today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Many Saints of Newark, Foundation, Beckett, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6F3nE015CItdqc1LFXCKEa6d2c=/169x0:1338x779/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541060/michael_gandolfini.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Michael Gandolfini stars as Tony Soprano in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAFfeGRbWLQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7EQHx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; returned to its very weird and funny roots this week and introduced Mandy Patinkin as a — let’s say “unconventional” judge, and it’s as if my favorite character from &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; got a new job. I know everyone is probably maxed out on how many streaming channels they can/want to subscribe to, but &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; is reason enough to at least check out Paramount Plus. And I have no idea what’s going to happen on the next episode of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; but (mild spoiler ahead!) I can’t imagine the two characters who got pruned will stay pruned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2awLf"&gt;This week we finally get a first look at the prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos &lt;/em&gt;and a new look at the new&lt;em&gt; Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt; show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0roKoN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAFfeGRbWLQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qOwkcG"&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PySsLR"&gt;In this prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Gandolfini plays Tony Soprano, the iconic role that won his father James multiple awards. Michael is a young Tony in what &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/many-saints-of-newark-trailer-sopranos-movie-alan-taylor"&gt;director Alan Taylor&lt;/a&gt; says is the story of Dickie Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola)— father of &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;’ Christopher— the man who made Tony into who he became. We get a glimpse of Vera Farmiga as Livia, who looks like she plays the matriarch as ice cold as the late, great Nancy Marchand did. Leslie Odom Jr., Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll, and Ray Liotta also star in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and HBO Max October 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w4sDcb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPT_PNucTWE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="olT7eW"&gt;Beckett&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TVfA1V"&gt;An American tourist vacationing in Greece gets into a car accident, and when he wakes up, he’s embroiled in a conspiracy and people are shooting at him. Mr. Beckett does not appear to have the same skill set as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKaB5dvQ4g&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;Jason Bourne&lt;/a&gt;, however, which will probably make things a bit more difficult as he tries to figure out what the hell is going on and attempts to get to the US Embassy. John David Washington and Alicia Vikander star in &lt;em&gt;Beckett,&lt;/em&gt; which hits Netflix August 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pKjod3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvOAA1U0li8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ncYdoF"&gt;Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1KMEPh"&gt;The second teaser trailer for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; finally gives us a release date for this long-awaited series based on the Isaac Asimov novels. The downfall of the Galactic Empire has been predicted by Hari Seldon (Jared Harris), so it has to build a foundation to preserve mankind’s knowledge. Along with Harris, Lee Pace stars as Brother Day, and Lou Llobell as Gaal Dornick. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; premieres September 24th on Apple TV Plus, with new episodes every Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lplJZ7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXdEeRBh9Zk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KEjKlH"&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="umjdTq"&gt;We got a teaser of the Kevin Smith revival of He-Man’s adventures in June, and now we get the full trailer. It’s not a retelling of the He-Man story, but rather picks up where the original TV show concluded in 1985. Chris Wood, Mark Hamill, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lena Headley, and Mark Hamill (as Skeletor) voice characters in &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe,&lt;/em&gt; which debuts on Netflix July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uUUatE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BSSoD73TSk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fao446"&gt;Jolt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9jN8Qt"&gt;This trailer has Kate Beckinsale kicking things and beating people up but she isn’t a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKHL5PyAPzs&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonyPicturesEntertainment"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;; instead she has a rare disorder that makes her rage out if she doesn’t get regular shock treatments from Stanley Tucci. Naturally she meets a guy who doesn’t freak out at her shocking condition (sorry) and of course he gets killed and the cops think she did it so then she has to do some revenge-kicking. Bobby Cannavale, Jai Courtney, Laverne Cox, and Susan Sarandon also star in &lt;em&gt;Jolt&lt;/em&gt; which comes to Amazon Prime Video July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tykCLL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzMpki"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Researcher finds certain network names can disable Wi-Fi on iPhones</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9xZla"&gt;A security researcher has found that certain Wi-Fi networks with the percent symbol (%) in their names can disable Wi-Fi on iPhones and other iOS devices. Carl Schou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vm_call/status/1411630091038203909?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that if an iPhone comes within range of a network named %secretclub%power, the device won’t be able to use Wi-Fi or any related features, and even after resetting network settings, the bug may continue to render Wi-Fi on the device unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aiJve1"&gt;A few weeks ago, Schou and his not-for-profit group, &lt;a href="https://secret.club/"&gt;Secret Club&lt;/a&gt;, which reverse-engineers software for research purposes,&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/"&gt; found that if an iPhone connected&lt;/a&gt; to a network with the SSiD name %p%s%s%s%s%n it would cause a bug in iOS’ networking stack that would disable its Wi-Fi, and system networking features like AirDrop would become unusable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NikSyL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; offered&lt;/a&gt; a possible explanation for the weird bug: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QmbFJV"&gt;the ‘%[character]’ syntax is commonly used in programming languages to format variables into an output string. In C, the ‘%n’ specifier means to save the number of characters written into the format string out to a variable passed to the string format function. The Wi-Fi subsystem probably passes the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) unsanitized to some internal library that is performing string formatting, which in turn causes an arbitrary memory write and buffer overflow. This will lead to memory corruption and the iOS watchdog will kill the process, hence effectively disabling Wi-Fi for the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="az5wDQ"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple to see if it’s working on a fix, and will update if we hear back from them. But as&lt;em&gt; 9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes, the bug can likely be avoided by not connecting to Wi-Fi networks with percent symbols in their names. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music is missing one major thing: a classic iPod to go with it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGh4pkF2WCmY3l5Jly55D9HUqUM=/0x0:5861x3907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540186/DSCF2292.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6Hwop"&gt;Earlier this year, I did something weird: I bought an iPod 5th generation, originally manufactured back in 2006. I got it mostly as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/22/17039896/ipod-diy-upgrade-battery-memory-hack"&gt;fun thing to mod&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve actually been using it on a near-daily basis. The experience has brought me to the conclusion that Apple should bring back the iPod, but updated for the modern age. It should keep the click-wheel of course, but I can’t stop thinking about how good an iPod, designed for the age of music streaming, AirPods, and high-res displays would be. I know that might sound silly, but let me explain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jic8nB"&gt;There are a few reasons why Apple should make a new iPod. For one, it would allow the company to capitalize on some nostalgia for the iPod age that seems to be coming around, based on recent iPod-themed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;web players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/28/20986886/iphone-app-ipod-classic-click-wheel-elvin-hu-developer"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/1/22260540/ipod-mod-portable-spotify-player-click-wheel-project"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgCPcV"&gt;The other, perhaps more obvious reason, is that the iPod is a music-centric device, and Apple literally has a service called Apple Music. The company is currently in love with services revenue, but many of its devices just aren’t that great at playing music. The iPhone makes it difficult to plug in many types of headphones, and Siri interrupts what you’re listening to when you’re asking it to do something simple that doesn’t really warrant an audible response (like turning on HomeKit-powered lights, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0FeZe"&gt;Most of, if not all, of Apple’s devices also can’t play the highest-end lossless files &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;that Apple Music can now deliver&lt;/a&gt; without additional hardware. This means that Apple doesn’t sell something it can point to and say “this is the best Apple Music experience you can get, period.” An iPod could be just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCZSDU"&gt;While Apple Music should be tightly integrated into a modern iPod, it would also be great if it could play music from other services, and if it had a totally Classic mode that just played files synced from a computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqksbh"&gt;Not only would opening the iPod up avoid some terrible optics for a company that’s being scrutinized by the government and competitors (like Spotify) for abusing its role as a platform and service designer, but it would also help avoid some of the weirdness that comes with streaming music. A lot of the times I use my iPod these days are because Apple Music is acting up, forcing me to restart the app because it claims that content is unauthorized, or completely fritzing out when trying to play the lossless music Apple recently introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgVvWG"&gt;(Seriously, is anyone else having this problem? Randomly, but very often, the song I’m trying to listen to will devolve into a flurry of high-pitched, digital-sounding squeals, like I’m listening to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6tFRzt-QvA"&gt;a 100 Gecs song&lt;/a&gt; playing on a Discman that’s being vigorously shaken.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjgX2T"&gt;Of course, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipod-touch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F4%2F22561092%2Fapple-bring-back-ipods-2021-music-services" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;does still sell an iPod&lt;/a&gt;, after all these years: the iPod Touch. Now, don’t get me wrong, the iPod Touch is a very good device, especially for children, and people who just want a non-expensive iOS device. But that’s just the thing — the iPod Touch isn’t a purpose-driven music player, it’s an iPhone without the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGVBSl"&gt;But so what? That just means it can use its headphone jack to listen to tunes from Apple Music, as well as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Prime Music, and anything else, as well as play games, surf the web, read books, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGdvcs"&gt;And that’s the rub for me: the iPod Touch is a good computing device, one that Apple should arguably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/28/18642381/apple-ipod-touch-update-iphone-7-processor"&gt;update more often&lt;/a&gt;, but sometimes the best tool for a job isn’t the one that can do everything. It’s the one that’s designed to do one thing really well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MjcC3m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPod Touch is a good device, but sometimes the best tool isn’t the one that can do everything&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XS8dx"&gt;For example, when I’m listening to music on an iOS device I often find that I’m not actually &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to the music, but scrolling through Twitter with it on in the background. That doesn’t happen with my 2006 iPod. The focus that comes with something that’s not offering you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU"&gt;everything, all of the time&lt;/a&gt;, is the same reason some people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444637/kobo-elipsa-e-reader-giant-screen-price-release-date-stylus"&gt;prefer e-readers&lt;/a&gt; over just reading on a tablet or phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3L4ka"&gt;And, practically speaking, making a dedicated portable music player without a smartphone OS and touchscreen would mean that Apple wasn’t competing as much with Android-powered players from the likes of &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/audio-components/hi-res-audio/p/nwa105-b"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Resolution-Lossless-Bluetooth-Spotify/dp/B07L8P8QDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fiio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8iK0s"&gt;There’s also the matter of hardware — if Apple made a new iPod designed for just listening to music, it wouldn’t have to make it powerful enough to run 3D games or Safari, and could instead put resources to a better DAC and amp (perhaps one that could play Apple Music’s aforementioned 24 bit, 192 kHz lossless files). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgxBsf"&gt;I don’t think that a new iPod would ever reach the dizzying heights of popularity that the older models did. Most people are perfectly content to listen to music on their phones — if they weren’t, Apple probably wouldn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/27/16050420/apple-ipod-nano-shuffle-discontinued"&gt;stopped selling iPods&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. However, Apple’s a big company — it could stand to make a niche, music-focused device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434783/apple-homepod-stock-problems-discontinued-sale"&gt;even if its last one didn’t do so well&lt;/a&gt;. And as an old iPod enthusiast, it coming out with a new one would be literal music to my ears (I had to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USYUkK"&gt;P.S. — I’ve also found the Apple Music experience on the Apple Watch to be pretty mediocre, and I don’t want to take my phone on a run. I’m not saying there’s room for an iPod Shuffle with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522993/apple-siri-on-device-speech-recognition-no-internet-wwdc"&gt;the new offline Siri&lt;/a&gt; instead of VoiceOver, but...&lt;/p&gt;
