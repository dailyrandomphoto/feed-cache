    <title>The iPhone’s notch: should it stay or should it go?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcZ_XzHyPV5dqo1n_h3cEjgzt1A=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873052/Apple_iphone13_display_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="evzXav"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup&lt;/a&gt; comes with the biggest change Apple has made to the front of its iPhones since it first introduced Face ID with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review"&gt;iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;: that controversial notch has finally been shrunken down a bit. Apple says the new notch is about 20 percent smaller than the old one, although eagle-eyed observers have noticed it comes with the tradeoff of being a hair taller, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDtY9x"&gt;The new and improved notch is still a notch. A big notch, too, compared to the hole-punch cameras and teardrop cutouts that competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;like Samsung&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; have been offering on their flagship phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyF7Oh"&gt;Naturally, we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have some thoughts on the subject: is the notch worth it in 2021? Or does it need to go the way of the dinosaur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DHmSDR"&gt;
&lt;p id="egbcNs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve been using a notched iPhone since the iPhone X first launched, and I’m a notch apologist at this point. Compared to the bezel-heavy style that preceded it, it’s an obvious improvement; it’s hard to go back to the older iPhone SE style. And while a lot of Face ID-based features have turned out to be pretty gimmicky (looking at you, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16735822/animoji-karaoke-tutorial-iphone-x"&gt;Memoji and Animoji&lt;/a&gt;), the core functionality here is still really, really great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjhd3o"&gt;When it comes to unlocking a phone, Face ID just works, and it works well. And that’s largely because it does need all the tech that Apple fits in (including the various sensors, IR emitters, and the actual front-facing camera.) True, Android phones don’t have notches like the iPhone, but they also don’t have facial unlock systems that work nearly as well. And if a notch is the price to pay for convenience, it’s one I can accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYzWH0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean Hollister: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure, I admit Face ID is fantastic. It was the single greatest thing about switching from Android for me. I couldn’t believe how easy it was to log into my bank, check my medical records, or access and copy/paste my password manager’s passwords when I made an iPhone 12 Mini my daily driver last year. But that’s just as much a jab at Android as it is praise for the iPhone — because what I love is &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt;, which has nothing to do with my face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bUtXY5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Speed has nothing to do with my face&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5pcCm8"&gt;Why hasn’t Android standardized on an excellent, fast fingerprint sensor, one placed precisely where I leave my digits anyhow? Why did Apple always insist on fitting it into the bottom bezel of its phones where I’d have to awkwardly stretch down? Why not mount a fingerprint-reading camera in that iPhone logo Apple always loves to leave on the back of its phones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaXHjl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: A rear fingerprint reader would mess with Apple’s easily shattered lovely looking slab of glass on the back, though. If the company can nail an under-glass fingerprint reader, they’re better off just sticking one on the front of the phone under the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yWEGO"&gt;The one thing I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; see an argument for is bringing back Touch ID, integrated into the power button (like on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; and the recent iPad Air.) But even if you were to do that, Apple would still have to find somewhere to put the front-facing camera. Hiding it away in the bezels won’t work on an iPhone; there’s just simply nowhere to put it. And choosing between a small notch with less functionality and a marginally larger one with more, Face ID is an easy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ijGU5leA7gYTi_720eLC0BfzSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850355/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini, with Touch ID.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G7Lcr6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;They could put it where everyone else puts it these days: a tiny hole instead of a giant notch. Or how about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;those under-display selfie cameras&lt;/a&gt; we’ve heard so much about? Speaking of which, what keeps Apple from giving us an under-display fingerprint sensor, or sticking the guts of Face ID into the hole in a hole-punch display, too? I’m not saying the notch bugs me every single time I look at the screen (OLED works wonders), but surely you don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a notch just to fit a couple of fancy IR blasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEfHpg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: Right now it sounds like under-display cameras are still a bit more trouble then they’re worth; assuming Apple gets on board with that, it’d imagine it’ll still be some time before the tech catches up to the idea of what it could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urqYJH"&gt;But even if they were, there’s a lot more to Face ID than just a couple of fancy IR blasters. Remember this slide from when Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16288806/apple-iphone-x-price-release-date-features-announced"&gt;announced the iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S569GXo7aLn-mHvKIdf_Gxq4JRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9230639/apple_iphone_2017_20170912_11726.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s inside the iPhone’s notch, circa iPhone X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2OZw3Z"&gt;That seems like it’d be more difficult to cram into a hole punch cutout — even if Apple was willing to go with a larger one, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus&lt;/a&gt;’ double-camera cutout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm3AMN"&gt;Of course, the biggest argument in favor of bringing a fingerprint reader back is the stark reality of 2020 and 2021: the fact that we’re all wearing masks all the time, and that Face ID, frankly, is terrible when you’re wearing a mask. But hopefully that issue will improve if (when?) the pandemic starts to ebb, and I can go back to easily unlocking my phone when I’m out and about again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjmFnE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;Hey! I was saving that argument for later. Cutting me off at the pass is a dirty trick. So do you agree that speed matters more than the fact that Face ID uses your face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yy2nuA"&gt;Okay, let’s pretend for a moment that Face ID actually requires a linear array of components (even though the speaker, microphone, ambient light sensor and proximity sensor in that image all feature in standard phones and almost all of them could easily be placed on a phone’s rim). What’s so wrong about giving a phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;a little bit of forehead&lt;/a&gt; instead of a notch, like the Pixel 4’s Face ID competitor? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BLIvC7sjrH7T4cLd3x1x_ZujPOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19302260/vpavic_191016_3730_0082.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 4 stuck its sensors inside its forehead instead of a notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RjrFbf"&gt;Stick some extra battery underneath the additional height that change would afford — or hell, how about a good ol’ headphone jack. Design certainly isn’t the reason that particular Pixel failed; it was panned for lackluster battery life and gimmicks, and probably didn’t have anywhere near &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;enough marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cSc6d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: I mean, design may have had something to do with it, but the Pixel 4 helps prove my point: Google was cramming way more tech than even Face ID had for the sake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/30/21496318/google-soli-radar-motion-sense-rick-osterloh-pixel-5"&gt;gimmicky Soli gestures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="letRMx"&gt;And taking up the whole top of the phone for a camera array feels like a worse situation than the notch; at least with the notch, you can still nominally use the top area of the phone as a status bar thanks to the “rabbit ears” of screens on the side (something that previous versions of iOS had to devote useful pixel space for.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Llo3e"&gt;There’s also the chance that Apple could one day add Touch ID back to the iPhone, either in button or in-display form. But even if it does, it’s hard for me to imagine the company backtracking from Face ID at this point. Which means that like it or not, Sean, you’ll probably have to suffer a notch for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HGlMWK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;I guess I kinda like the rabbit ears. But suffer, I will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pXeN7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRANRc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwqbhc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KACKtl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKICbv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejbLCS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoxaZ2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook tells Apple employees he’s ‘looking forward to moving forward’ after Epic ruling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iq80HEV7RCR4gvDyHj2oHqRVItE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873004/1233030828.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ipmKjv"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that he was “looking forward to moving forward” after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;a verdict in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; antitrust case&lt;/a&gt;. In an all-hands meeting with employees, Cook echoed the line Apple has taken publicly on the case, celebrating the company’s legal wins and downplaying its loss on an unfair competition claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngNyVt"&gt;“If you sort of back up and remember what the App Store is about, the App Store was built to be a trusted place for users so they could go explore and discover apps. It was meant to be a great business opportunity for developers,” Cook told employees, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Epic came along and wanted basically to be handled in a special way. Our rules are that we treat everyone the same. They ask us repeatedly to treat them different, we said no, and they sued us on 10 different items. The court ruled nine of those in favor of Apple and one in favor of Epic. Most importantly, they ruled that Apple is not a monopoly, which we’ve always known. Apple is in a fiercely competitive market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CR0Kgk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There were one or two sentences scratched out of an agreement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2SQ7Fw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21396313/apple-fortnite-lawsuit-emails-app-store-ban-epic"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney asked Apple&lt;/a&gt; last year to let it include alternate payment methods in its iOS version of the game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. However, Sweeney said that Epic “hope[d] that Apple will also make these options equally available to all iOS developers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5yp2C"&gt;Contrary to Cook’s statement that “we treat everyone the same,” Apple has provided special treatment to a variety of app developers in the past. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;It offered Netflix a special deal&lt;/a&gt; where it took just a 15 percent cut of subscriptions sold inside the app, and weighed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;offering special perks to Netflix&lt;/a&gt; if the streaming video company would maintain support for in-app purchases. The company also carved out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;categories of apps&lt;/a&gt; that can bypass its commission for in-app purchases, and blocked or decided not to feature apps it seemingly feared might compete. You can see examples of special treatment for particular developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;in our collection of unearthed emails&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSMwHo"&gt;Cook is correct, however, that a California judge ruled Apple didn’t have a monopoly in digital gaming transactions — the relevant market in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;. The company successfully avoided Epic’s demands that it open up iOS to third-party app stores and sideloaded apps, and the court said Apple was justified in collecting a commission on digital goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OyR1Wk"&gt;Cook didn’t confirm whether Apple planned to appeal its one loss: the verdict that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;Apple’s anti-steering rules&lt;/a&gt; (which restrict developers from telling users about alternate payment options) violate California’s Unfair Competition Law. The ruling orders Apple to abandon the rules by December. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;Epic has indicated&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to appeal its own losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcz7gj"&gt;But like Apple spokespeople &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;have done publicly&lt;/a&gt;, Cook suggested he wasn’t overly worried. “I think the ruling will be very good to try to put some of the discussions to rest on the App Store. In terms of the one we lost, there were one or two sentences scratched out of an agreement, that was the extent of it. I’m sort of looking forward to moving forward now,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new COVID-19 policy calls for frequent testing of unvaccinated employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fu5aS6"&gt;As Apple conducts an all-hands meeting today, Zoë Schiffer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1438905393615233034"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company informed employees in its offices and stores of a new policy around COVID-19. Starting next month, any employees who are vaccinated can come into its spaces while doing some testing for the disease, while those who aren’t will have to get frequent testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79oLQu"&gt;The company’s updated guidelines appear to line up with the OSHA standards that will be established as a result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666508/biden-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;the Biden Administration’s push to increase vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG6Fmv"&gt;Apple recently pushed back the date when it expects employees to return to its office in response to a surge of cases and the Delta variant. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;email in August&lt;/a&gt; said the mandatory return is delayed until at least January 2022, and employees can expect a one-month notice ahead of time before it goes into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PaD0S"&gt;During the meeting, CEO Tim Cook to employees that “we need to learn” about a hybrid workplace after years of being entirely in the office and the last 18 months or so at home. In the immediate future, Apple will give everyone in the company three extra days off next quarter. For employees in the US, those days are coming in the week of Thanksgiving, while teams in other countries will set their dates independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nz9GWL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BREAKING: Apple is rolling out a COVID-19 testing mandate next month. Vaccinated employees will get infrequent tests if going into an office or store. Unvaccinated employees will have to get frequent testing.&lt;/p&gt;— Zoë Schiffer (@ZoeSchiffer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1438905393615233034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y76x0s"&gt;We’ve just gotten our first look at the iPhone 13s’ battery sizes, thanks to a product information sheet &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fmore-resources%2Fgtc.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F17%2F22678607%2Fiphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;posted on Apple’s behalf&lt;/a&gt; to hazardous material information and response company &lt;a href="https://app.clickdimensions.com/blob/chemtreccom-aczvc/files/apis_bpisreportupdated20210916.pdf?1631813744835"&gt;Chemtrec’s website&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/16/iphone-13-battery-life/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The document shows that the batteries in iPhones have gotten significantly bigger since last year — 13 percent larger, on average — and the 13 Pro Max’s battery is getting comparable to devices like the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNcqjd"&gt;In the document, battery sizes are reported in watt-hours instead of the more traditional milliamp hours. Even though most phone manufacturers give battery sizes in milliamp hours, they’re often &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/watts-in-a-name-why-were-using-watt-hours-to-compare-batteries/"&gt;less accurate and harder to compare&lt;/a&gt; devices, so we prefer watt-hours. Here are the battery sizes of Apple’s new phones and the previous-gen models, according to the document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pdIdxH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10757785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2EYbYy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fmore-resources%2Fgtc.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F17%2F22678607%2Fiphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; it provides this information to Chemtrec to help carriers comply, so this information comes directly from the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KxUwvs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 12 and 12 Pro had the same size battery, but the 13 and 13 Pro seemingly don’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDpfkR"&gt;A few things jump out in the chart. The sizes have obviously gotten significantly bigger across the board, and there’s one weird year-over-year change: the 12 and 12 Pro used to have the same size battery, but now the 13 Pro’s battery is actually smaller than the 13’s. The phones are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;the same physical size,&lt;/a&gt; and the Pro is packing a higher refresh rate screen, an extra GPU core, and more cameras, so it makes sense if there’s less room for the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1MSRz"&gt;Apple also made each model slightly thicker and heavier than its predecessor. With this iPhone 13 lineup, the company seemingly makes the same tradeoff as it did with the 11: bigger phones with a better battery (a move that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20859715/iphone-11-pro-max-battery-life-size-thickness-weight-apple"&gt;garnered a good amount of praise&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZN5KK"&gt;As a few points of comparison, here are the rated capacities we were able to find for other phones and devices by consulting iFixit’s teardowns: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="R6BDva"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/m4vrgZ3PqskbyvKM.huge"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;: 18.84Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p36QTs"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oR3xLWXumQOWvDOi.huge"&gt;Google Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;: 15.48Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UfT2Nd"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fGLArIvH1JFVZruL.huge"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;: 16.96Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZybyL"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FMbVvMqgfc4HxXFV.huge"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;: 16Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LDKPhp"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPad%2BAir%2B4%2BTeardown%2F141032&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F17%2F22678607%2Fiphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;: 28.93Wh (the same capacity noted in the Chemtrec document)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DCjeMQ"&gt;According to the numbers found in the document, the 13 Pro Max’s 16.75Wh battery represents a healthy fraction of what you’ll find in some laptop batteries. It’s got 71 percent of the capacity of my ThinkPad T480’s main battery (rated for 23.48Wh), and it’s a bit more than 33 percent of the MacBook Air’s all-day 49.9 watt-hour battery. Plus, it’s bigger than the Switch’s battery, and that thing can run Breath of the Wild for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6S0SzW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to say how much extra time you’ll actually get using your phone at this point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqjGcGKlVAElNFJ3tyaA1-HB8j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22856676/Screen_Shot_2021_09_16_at_5.43.10_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says the iPhone 12 Pro Max will get you 2.5 hours further into your day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hIxjqF"&gt;Given that the phones’ processor is changing and displays are getting brighter, it’s hard to say how much real-world battery life these battery size increases can give you. In its presentation, Apple said that the new batteries would last 1.5 hours “longer in your day” for the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=3154"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=4401"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and 2.5 hours later for the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=3156"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=4407"&gt;13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;. By Apple’s measure, if your iPhone 12 tapped out at 9:30PM, it expects the iPhone 13 will make it to midnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmdME7"&gt;It’s not a particularly meaningful metric without context (though according to Apple, the iPhone 13 will get 4 more hours of streamed video playback than its predecessor, and the 13 Pro Max will get 13 more hours), so we’ll have to wait to see how the phones hold up to real-life usage and how they fare in the side-by-side rundown tests. However, Apple has made the battery a selling point for these phones, so it’s in the company’s best interest to back that up with some impressive numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="CI38y2"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3uSSl"&gt;This biggest tech story this week: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s hardware event&lt;/a&gt;. Nilay, Dieter, and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz discuss everything announced at the event — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673993/apple-fitness-plus-workouts-countries-languages-pilates-snow"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; —  and how they stack up against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;last year's models&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of rumors we discussed over the past couple of weeks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"&gt;didn’t turn out to be true&lt;/a&gt;, with instead just minor updates. So was this an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675797/iphone-13-12s-upgrade-cycle-iterative-improvements"&gt;“S” event?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5M9kxv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpM43r"&gt;After analyzing the new hardware season, keep listening for some other gadget news, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;Nintendo finally adding Bluetooth audio to the Switch&lt;/a&gt; and why the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;Pixel 6 Tensor chip sounds really weird&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iPhone’s location tracking </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leEXkTb0hpgtXR8qvSk-3L4t47o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69871891/akrales_190913_3628_0277.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TeBzxN"&gt;Your iPhone uses information from your cell service, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to pinpoint its location, and since you almost always have your phone on you, your location as well. That information can be useful for a lot of things, such as letting others know where you are or finding your phone when it’s lost. Other times, it’s just more data that services and companies collect about you, creating privacy concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2rbnr"&gt;The good news is you can tighten your controls so that apps are only accessing your location when it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGeN94"&gt;Toggling your location settings can differ from phone to phone, depending on what model of iPhone you have and what version of iOS it’s running. The following directions were tested on an iPhone 11 running iOS 15; if you’re running a different version of iOS, there shouldn’t be much difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nJYdGZ"&gt;Turn off location access for specific apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2bachq"&gt;Location data is useful for some apps (for example, if you want to order food) and necessary for others, like maps or ride-shares. However, if an app asks for your location and you don’t feel it needs the data, you can disable location services for that app. Here’s how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="10QMkI"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yjxmeM"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XXWXWw"&gt;“Location Services” will most likely be switched on. Unless you want to completely cut all location services off (see below), leave it alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qwmyHl"&gt;Scroll down to find a list of all the apps that enable location services. Each listing will show the app’s name and the type of permission it has: “Never,” “When Shared,” or “While Using.” “When Shared” refers to the option “Ask Next Time Or When I Share.” Meanwhile, “While Using” will usually mean “While using the App,” but it can sometimes also refer to “While Using the App or Widgets.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APxPyw"&gt;If you want to change a specific app’s access to your location data, click on the app listing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you can allow location access depends on the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0xJQiW"&gt;If you click “While Using the App,” then that app will have access to your location either when it’s open or when it’s in use in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4mvxq"&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services” at the bottom of the “Location Services” screen. Here, you can toggle location access for a number of things, including Wi-Fi, time zone, emergency calls, and Apple News and App Store ads that are relevant to your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YugSqN"&gt;To the left of some of the service toggles, you may see a small arrow. A hollow arrow means the item may have access to your location under certain conditions; a purple arrow means the item has recently used your location, while a gray arrow means it used your location sometime in the last 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1BI4ULPUOLpp4D6EXdpLY1UeSoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857589/IMG_11AB5BCB37D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Arrows show which apps are accessing your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0NqNW6ZvUftQBR3XzifVQDNuOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857582/IMG_4283119948D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrows show which apps are accessing your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f9PkYM"&gt;To check whether your phone is still collecting location data, go down to the very bottom of the “System Services” screen and toggle the switch on for “Status Bar Icon.” This will display an arrow at the top of your screen when an app on your phone is accessing your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvTXrC"&gt;If you want to truly go off the grid, you can disable location services to prevent your phone from collecting any location data at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r8HSiU"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hknF2h"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4s36Y6"&gt;Toggle the “Location Services” switch to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="affITu"&gt;You’ll get a notice telling you that, while Location Services will be disabled for all apps, it will temporarily come online if you use the “Find My iPhone” and report your phone lost. Select “Turn Off.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CcJJeH"&gt;If you have an iPhone 11 or later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NSGXGW"&gt;If you have a phone designed with Apple’s U1 chip — such as an iPhone 11 or later — and have disabled location services for specific apps, you may find that you still sometimes see the arrow. According to Apple, this is because these models &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997338/apple-ultra-wideband-u1-chip-iphone-11-pro-location-data-request-privacy-issue"&gt;use ultra wideband technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple says is regulated, so the phones use location services to determine if they’re in an area where ultra wideband use is restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwciFf"&gt;The iPhone requests location data when location preferences are set on an app-per-app basis, so switching off location services for your phone overall will stop these location requests since your phone won’t be able to collect any location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0BmHZV"&gt;Share your location with individuals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AvJ5VO"&gt;If you’re walking alone at night or you’re in an Uber by yourself, you might want a friend or family member to know your location in real time. If you have iOS 13 or later, you can use the Find My app to share your location with family and friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yd7T8R"&gt;Open “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qRKhHK"&gt;Go into “Privacy,” and make sure “Location Services” is switched on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZS7j0A"&gt;Go back to the main “Settings” menu and tap on your name at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wO93M2"&gt;Select “Find My.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ADpOmK"&gt;Toggle “Share My Location” so that it’s on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aajRcv"&gt;Then go to the Find My app. If this is your first time using the app, it will ask you whether you want it to access your location. Choose either to “Allow While Using App,” “Allow Once,” or “Don’t Allow.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EP4LB6"&gt;You may get a screen explaining that “Find My” can be used with an AirTag or for AirPods, and that there are apps for the watchOS as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C2oZkD"&gt;On the map screen that appears, select “People” at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TJymR1"&gt;Click the button that says “Start Sharing Location.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="poO8DJ"&gt;In the “To:” field, type in either the phone number or name of your friend or family member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MMwj9E"&gt;If the person you select has a phone number that isn’t associated with an iPhone, you’ll be notified with a pop-up. (But you can still share your location.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v9RYlu"&gt;Tap “Send,” then select either “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Find My app lets you share your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoCeKInZlvEqdEYDXrfO3-0j4qs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857616/IMG_425BFDC7C40D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Find My app lets you share your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDV8vATBkeqsU6AiIwFDxv73JN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857538/IMG_80499A0AC888_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OLskUW"&gt;It will then start sharing your location. In order to switch it off, click on your contact’s name in the “Find My” app under “People,” then tap “Stop Sharing My Location.” Confirm by clicking on the “Stop Sharing Location” button that pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YX8aIT"&gt;Send recurring notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="alLgD7"&gt;You can have your phone send out recurring notifications as well. These are useful if you want your friend or relative to know when a you get to a location (or don’t get there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4aqISQ"&gt;In the “Find My” app, tap the “People” tab at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ikQYZL"&gt;Select the person you want to send notifications to (it should be somebody you’re already sharing your location with).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Oj16lY"&gt;Scroll down until you see “Notifications” and tab “Add.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4QBnWx"&gt;A pop-up from the bottom will give you the option to notify that person. Select it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TzQf1e"&gt;You can notify the person when you arrive at or leave a specific location, and send the notification just once or every time you arrive or leave (for example, if you want to let somebody know every day when you get home from work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KY2bKD"&gt;Share via Messages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uB02dt"&gt;You can share your location through Messages as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LrbY2N"&gt;Open a conversation in Messages. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VCb4XE"&gt;Tap on the contact name and then click “Info.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="25EDCT"&gt;This will give you the option to “Share My Location,” which will give you the option to “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.” Click one of those to start sharing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ScUruo"&gt;If you want to stop sharing, click “Stop Sharing My Location” where “Share My Location” was. A button labeled “Stop Sharing My Location” will pop up. Click on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="KqQCyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 2021, 10:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on December 12th, 2019, and has been updated to account for differences in iOS and in available services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKF7xFC4hTYRm-7tz1b73WWCeWk=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857848/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the colors of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIBU9V"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;a fleet of new products at its “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;. Chief among them — you guessed it — was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. This one is coming in various sizes and colors, but with smaller notches, the new A15 Bionic chipset, and with redesigned and improved cameras located around the back. Going from smallest to largest, Apple will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and finally the iPhone 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;With the Pro and Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be able to get the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage, along with 120Hz refresh rate displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1YGEt"&gt;If you’re looking forward to ordering any of the four iPhone 13 models, the good news is you can preorder now, and it should arrive on release day, which is Friday, September 24th. Based on years prior, the ship date can slip later if you order them closer to release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIozlV"&gt;If you’re curious about all of the options and how much it’ll all cost, we’ve listed all of that info below for buying unlocked. All of the carrier-specific promos, including trade-in deals, are listed at the bottom of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7zyyJ"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7E96Ug"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is the 2021 iteration on the Mini phone form factor with a 5.4-inch OLED screen. Apple says that this newer version should get better battery life than the previous model. Battery life was one of the few disappointments in the iPhone 12 Mini, so it’s good that Apple seems to have made improvements here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytXyfk"&gt;Apple will offer the iPhone 13 Mini starting with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $729&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to opt for more storage with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; versions for $829 or $1,029, respectively. If you purchase through a carrier via Apple’s site, the starting price of each configuration drops $30, starting at $699. If you want to trade in your phone, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check for its value right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nPdN53"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DVnDHN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 has a 6.1-inch OLED display, the same size as last year’s model. Like other models this year, Apple upgraded the internal chipset to the A15 Bionic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NHlw2"&gt;Preorders will begin Friday, September 17th at Apple. Buying them unlocked will cost you $30 more than buying through a carrier, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $829 for the 128GB version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$929 for the 256GB version&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,129 for the 512GB version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGvHEm"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find out your phone’s value at Apple&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in for credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BaJlBq"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eBv8ru"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are the biggest and most capable models coming out of Apple in 2021. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch OLED display with an A15 Bionic chipset, while the Pro Max has a bigger 6.7-inch OLED. Both support up to 120Hz refresh rate, which is an improvement that’s long been anticipated. However, you’ll also pay a lot more for this model than the base iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAUxcl"&gt;At Apple, the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models start at $999 and $1,099, respectively. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; will run you $1,099, while the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; will cost $1,199. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration&lt;/a&gt; of either model will also cost an extra $200, with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,499 and the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,599. Unlike the iPhone 13 Mini and standard iPhone 13, there’s no $30 price difference if you choose to purchase the Pro line unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHpfYv"&gt;As mentioned before, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s site can tell you how much your current phone is worth&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wmtN87"&gt;iPhone 13 lineup carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jzmr1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; Current and new Verizon users can save on any of the iPhone 13 models with a trade-in if you’re on certain unlimited plans, billed back to you in monthly credits over the course of 24 or 30 months. New customers can get an additional $500 worth in credits by switching carriers to Verizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74PqP"&gt;How much you’ll get in trade-in credit varies depending on the phone you want, with up to $1,000 back in billing credits if you buy the iPhone 13 Pro Max and have an unlimited plan. If you’re after the 128GB iPhone 13 Pro that usually costs $999, trading in select phones can make it free after you’ve received billing credits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n71NlO"&gt;If you want the iPhone 13, Verizon will offer those on an unlimited plan up to $800 for a trade-in, and you’ll get reimbursed via billing credits. For an iPhone 13 Mini, trade in values cap at $700.  &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.verizon.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKEbcd"&gt;According to a Verizon spokesperson, these are the phones that will get the most amount of trade-in value (though the carrier will accept most phones in any condition, but battery damage is a deal-breaker): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vp61Ou"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3SAWq"&gt;These are the mid-tier devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xce8xP"&gt;Apple: iPhone X and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u4VbAe"&gt;Samsung: GS9 and Note 9 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OSmNtc"&gt;Google: Pixel 4A and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lcmacj"&gt;Kyocera: DuraForce Ultra &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5PQFGX"&gt;LG: V50 ThinQ and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3IkQLY"&gt;Motorola: Moto One 5G, RAZR, Edge Plus &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FgPHff"&gt;Nokia: 8 V 5G &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a1j0LX"&gt;OnePlus: 7 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UxtFME"&gt;Sony: Xperia 1 and up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The iPad Mini doesn’t support mmWave 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGWfi-7rfT3vKeFYmomSsjIqsYQ=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69870020/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pXwYQN"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;newly redesigned iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most exciting announcements at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665413/apple-event-iphone-13-announcements-news-products"&gt;iPhone 13 event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, but in the aftermath a limitation has been identified: As spotted by &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/09/a-few-extra-notes-about-apples-september-14-event/"&gt;Jason Snell from &lt;em&gt;Six Colors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the new iPad Mini doesn’t support mmWave 5G. There’s also a hint that its new A15 Bionic processor might be downclocked in comparison to the version that appears in the iPhone 13 line (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/ipad-mini-downclocked-a15-chip/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via&lt;em&gt; MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YycHZt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;Support for 5G&lt;/a&gt; on the cellular version of the iPad Mini was one of Apple’s major highlights, but &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/specs/#:~:text=Cellular%20and%20Wireless,eSIM6"&gt;looking at Apple’s tech specs&lt;/a&gt;, while it supports low- and mid-band 5G, it doesn’t offer mmWave. Apple first started playing into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;the 5G hype machine with the launch of the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, and continues to tout the faster download and upload speeds the tech can offer in 2021. You can see the cellular and wireless features Apple highlights for the iPad Mini below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/99E7IPl1KKw5jgEzdgI3kaUbB-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22856329/Screenshot_2021_09_16_3.08.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s breakdown of the cellular components in the new iPad Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dHCZuL"&gt;Getting fast 5G speeds is dependent on coverage, which has improved in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;but isn’t always faster than LTE&lt;/a&gt;. Carriers like&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt; Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325857/t-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; have big plans to improve 5G performance in 2021 — including increasing the availability of fast mmWave — but where coverage is limited, it might not be worth the trouble yet. In our experience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;reviewing the iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, mmWave was finnicky. Here’s &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s editor-in-chief Nilay Patel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="fi7JWy"&gt;In a patch of 20 glorious square feet, I pulled over 2 gigabits per second down. (And 40 megabits per second up, which matched regular 5G.) If I walked 100 feet away, the signal dropped, and that was that. I hope you are not anticipating being very mobile with your 5G mobile phone if you have giant files to download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="99G09n"&gt;Maybe not a huge loss for the Mini just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJ66b7"&gt;The same might be said for the iPad Mini’s processor. The GeekBench benchmarks &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/ipad-mini-downclocked-a15-chip/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; cites&lt;/a&gt; points to the Mini’s performance &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/9851750"&gt;coming in at 2.9 GHz&lt;/a&gt;, a bit slower than the 3.2 GHz the publication sourced for the iPhone 13. However, GeekBench is not the be-all-end-all for understanding the performance of a device. Without an iPad Mini to test in hand, there’s no way to be absolutely certain those numbers are accurate. It’s also not too difficult to fake a GeekBench score, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-xl-5g-fake/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; has proven&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yWwXm"&gt;If you’re looking for an actual verifiable difference between the new Mini and iPhones, look to graphics performance. The iPad Mini offers five graphics cores, one more than the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini’s 4-core GPU. There’s no way to tell what that looks like until we review it, but the mmWave-less iPad Mini might still be plenty capable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The bitter lawsuit hanging over the Apple Watch’s new swipe keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lf7t7XTCie4KES3CJ5bsAFEKnWQ=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869170/3tX1ydZgxW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, Apple really did type “copy” into its own keyboard during the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple allegedly offered to buy his app; instead, it’s being Sherlocked&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7J0PhN"&gt;In January 2019, Kosta Eleftheriou had every reason to believe Apple was about to make a deal, his lawsuit alleges. Apple’s head of keyboards &lt;em&gt;loved &lt;/em&gt;his FlickType keyboard app for the Apple Watch, gushing over how few mistakes it made. “Apple should buy this from you,” the man exclaimed, saying it “could be a key feature for the watch.” He demoed it for the Apple Watch team on January 24th, where a senior engineer allegedly gushed too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlJd8e"&gt;That evening, Eleftheriou received a message from Apple, but not the one he expected. In the course of one afternoon, the company had seemingly decided that Apple Watch keyboards were against the rules. “Specifically, the app is a keyboard for Apple Watch. For this reason, your app will be removed from sale on the App Store at this time,” Apple wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0RHrV"&gt;This Tuesday, Apple revealed its own swipe keyboard app alongside the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmmCZf"&gt;Eleftheriou had been Sherlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cN0A7V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So now we know. See you in court, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hJtPI2Z83J"&gt;https://t.co/hJtPI2Z83J&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1s7MUSLTpc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1s7MUSLTpc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1437845736951992321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dvc5W8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sherlocked&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DS3fQr"&gt;He’s far from the first. Apple has a long history of looking to its own app developers for inspiration, copying their ideas, and integrating them into its own operating systems for free. (It’s called “Sherlocking” because Apple famously copied a lot of features from the third-party Watson app over to its Sherlock desktop search tool in 2002; here are some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18651190/apple-ios-13-mac-os-catalina-third-party-apps-products-copy-wwdc-2019"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17428598/ios-12-apps-features-third-party-clones-bitmoji-houseparty"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133023/apple-bluemail-blix-restored-mac-app-store-sherlocking-patent-lawsuit"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zfBkO"&gt;But this isn’t your typical case of whether a developer should be entitled to their income or whether users deserve the functionality for free — and not just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1437899751496769541"&gt;because Apple’s making users pay for a new Watch to get it&lt;/a&gt;.  When Apple blocked his app two years ago and continued to tussle with him over updates, the company made an enemy of Eleftheriou. He’s become one of Apple’s most vocal critics, developing a reputation as a scam hunter. He continually and effectively points out that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;Apple is terrible at keeping out frauds&lt;/a&gt; which bilk ordinary users out of outrageous sums of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BLa2oV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching the most egregious scams","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"},{"title":"Eight things Apple could do to prove it actually cares about App Store users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TpIt0S"&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he filed a lawsuit against the company over his app&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the company continued to reject and hold up his Apple Watch keyboard for months in an attempt to force him to sell it to Apple for cheap. “Evidently, Apple thought Plaintiff would simply give up and sell its application to Apple at a discount,” &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/499290311/Kpaw-LLC-v-Apple-Inc#from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22100421__t_w__r_google.com__d_D"&gt;the complaint reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEjYab"&gt;Here’s the part where you might be thinking: “Wait, didn’t Apple ban every keyboard app for the Apple Watch back in 2019?” or “Didn’t Eleftheriou just tweet that rejection message and say ‘see you in court’ a couple days ago?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXLYTJ"&gt;The timeline’s a little confusing, it’s true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SL6Hu"&gt;Yes, Eleftheriou filed his suit nearly six full months before the Apple Watch Series 7 announcement. It’s not clear what impact the Sherlocking might have on the suit, and he won’t say. His lawyers are advising him against saying too much to journalists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MwCU4u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s untangle the timeline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0szggv"&gt;But no, Apple didn’t actually reject every Apple Watch keyboard app in 2019 — Eleftheriou believes his app was singled out for this treatment. &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shift-keyboard-swipe-type/id1452694750"&gt;Shift Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; had already arrived in February 2019, and even partner apps that included Eleftheriou’s keyboard tech (the complaint names Nano for Reddit, Chirp for Twitter and Lens for Instagram) allegedly made it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkarpU"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it changed its mind over time. Originally, the company didn’t think it was appropriate for a keyboard to take up the entirety of the Apple Watch’s small screen, but decided differently in 2019 after it saw the potential and says it’s encouraged Apple Watch keyboards ever since. The company basically admits that removing Eleftheriou’s app was a mistake, and claims it quickly corrected the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jM85i"&gt;But Eleftheriou disputes that last point, saying it took a year of appeals and resubmissions to get his keyboard back onto the store. “From [January 2019] on, I was simultaneously discussing a FlickType acquisition with them, while also being rejected,” he tells me. And Apple initially made it look like those appeals failed, too. “The App Review Board evaluated your app and determined that the original rejection feedback is valid. Please note that all appeal results are final,” reads Eleftheriou from a message he received in May 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJC81x"&gt;In the complaint, he alleges it wasn’t until January 2020, a year after the surprise takedown, that his Apple Watch keyboard extension was approved. When FlickType for Apple Watch did finally arrive, it became the number one paid app in the entire store, pulled in $130,000 in its first month, he claims, and was named &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/"&gt;one of Apple’s top paid apps of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. That’s what he’s using as grounds that he’s been financially harmed in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GnWbN"&gt;Not that he’s necessarily too worried about finances right now. “The FlickType income, yeah, I do expect it to eventually disappear given that the functionality will now be built-in,” he says, casually. “I don’t have a day job, but yeah this isn’t a big financial problem for me,” he adds when I ask. I wonder if he made good money &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pinterest-acquires-team-that-builtfleksy-inc-1466021492"&gt;when he sold his keyboard company Fleksy to Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; roughly five years ago. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/2/10900456/microsoft-swiftkey-acquisition-reported-250-million"&gt;Microsoft bought keyboard app SwiftKey for roughly $250 million&lt;/a&gt; just months earlier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll0yzt"&gt;Eleftheriou says FlickType has “mostly been a hobby,” but his other hobby — hunting down scam apps and calling out the App Store’s failings — stems from this whole situation, too. He was fed up watching competing apps thrive, including scams, after his own had been blocked by App Review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXy0HE"&gt;And last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627515/flicktype-ios-keyboard-discontinued-blind-visually-impaired"&gt;Eleftheriou publicly gave up on his popular iPhone keyboard extension for the blind&lt;/a&gt; after one too many rejections, due to what he describes as the latest misunderstanding by Apple’s App Review team of how his app (and the company’s own VoiceOver screen reader technology) are supposed to work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8n3rg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's with a heavy heart today that we're announcing the discontinuation of our award-winning iPhone keyboard for blind users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple has thrown us obstacle after obstacle for years while we try to provide an app to improve people's lives, and we can no longer endure their abuse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cH1HCQzeP1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cH1HCQzeP1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292830523744257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CRdQ69"&gt;“Our rejection history already spans more than FOURTY [sic] pages filled with repeated, unwarranted, &amp;amp; unreasonable rejections that serve to frustrate &amp;amp; delay rather than benefit end-users. And dealing with App Review isn’t just time-consuming. It’s also very emotionally draining,” he wrote at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1BPQm"&gt;Apple effectively tells me this, too, was a mistake on its part. The company says it now realizes the keyboard does in fact comply with its guidelines, has explained that to Eleftheriou several times, and has repeatedly encouraged him to submit the app again. Apple would prefer that he doesn’t take it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8H7idJ"&gt;But Eleftheriou says he’s had enough. Here’s the statement he sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="65BG7X"&gt;I will be delighted to bring back the accessible FlickType Keyboard for iPhone when Apple finally fixes their broken 3rd-party keyboard APIs on iOS and allows developers to fairly compete with Apple’s own keyboard. They must also ensure that every single reviewer has basic VoiceOver training - we keep getting rejections due to reviewers not knowing or even understanding how to use VoiceOver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMSeyl"&gt;I’ve already poured thousands of hours developing my app, working around countless keyboard API issues and dealing with app review, so I’m really looking forward to Apple’s improvements and will promptly re-submit the FlickType VoiceOver keyboard when sufficient progress has been made in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrE2Qb"&gt;As a separate note, I’m also calling on Apple to allow developers to access their own rejection history. Apple currently hides this from developers and even refuses to provide it upon request. It’s unacceptable that Apple will send us rejection messages that disappear shortly after, with no way to access them ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KGCtwr"&gt;He’s particularly annoyed with how Apple’s own keyboard has an unfair advantage since it doesn’t need to use its own APIs, and how those APIs are lacking features &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1430271507305881600"&gt;that Apple publicly promised years ago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQepWa"&gt;Technically, Eleftheriou is the one making the iPhone keyboard extension disappear, not Apple. It still exists in the current version on the store. He submitted a new version that removes the extension, one that’s currently pending with Apple’s App Review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rdnJxC"&gt;For now, Eleftheriou is going to take his keyboard and go home. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cook has been singing the praises of AR for five years&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ERzUQ0"&gt;Tim Cook has just marked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;10 years as Apple’s CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and while he’s grown Apple into the most valuable company in the world, it’s reasonable to argue he hasn’t yet introduced a signature, industry shaking product like Apple co-founder Steve Jobs did with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqO7Qo"&gt;But if you’ve been following Apple for a minute, you’ve probably heard Cook talk about the game-changing potential of augmented reality. While he once said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/28/4374482/tim-cook-apple-wearable-google-glass"&gt;hard to see the appeal of Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;, the AR wearable that proved unpopular with consumers, he’s held a consistently positive opinion on AR since at least 2016. While most of the industry was putting all its eggs in the VR basket, Cook repeatedly expressed support for what he views as the far superior AR. This would become a running theme: AR good, VR not so good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3j429"&gt;It seems likely that AR may become the hallmark of Cook’s tenure, as long as Apple executes on a winning idea. While that’s not exactly guaranteed — Apple has yet to unveil an AR headset or glasses — Cook’s frequent comments about the tech keep the topic in the news and reassure investors and customers that Apple is working on it. In September 2021, he went as far as to call himself “AR fan number one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZIIDx"&gt;AR features are already available on the iPhone and iPad. And while hope is starting to fade that Apple will release a mixed reality device in 2022, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;latest rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; the company is still forging ahead with some kind of AR / VR headset to be released in the not-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jIE1"&gt;Here’s a brief history of all the times Tim Cook said he was convinced AR was the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LR10VY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook says in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/26/12290920/apple-augmented-reality-ar-tim-cook"&gt;quarterly earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that “AR can be really great.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX7rQO"&gt;“We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run, we think there’s great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. The number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers’ kind of products like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, that’s why you see so many iPhones in the wild chasing pokemons.” (Cook pronounces it “pokey-mans.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3BaXv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-prefers-augmented-reality/story?id=42064913"&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview that he believes AR is a bigger deal than VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtE9kB"&gt;“There’s virtual reality and there’s augmented reality — both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEwdho"&gt;AR “gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things — visually — for both of us to see. Maybe it’s something we’re talking about, maybe it’s someone else here who’s not here present but who can be made to appear to be present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WB8GUn"&gt;“There’s a lot of really cool things there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqvA1V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook makes a brief mention of AR in a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2016/08/13/tim-cook-the-interview-running-apple-is-sort-of-a-lonely-job/?utm_term=.71cfafb58188"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt;: “I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfFqeu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;In an appearance at Utah Tech Tour, Cook goes into detail about &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/02/tim-cook-talks-steve-jobs-need-for-encryption-at-utah-tech-tour-video/"&gt;how crucial AR may become&lt;/a&gt; and why he views it as superior to VR — while stressing that AR presents significant technology challenges before it can be adopted for mass consumerism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="s4U9pW"&gt;In terms of it becoming a mass adoption [phenomenon], so that, say, everyone in here would have an AR experience, the reality to do that, it has to be something that everyone in here views to be an “acceptable thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE5O2T"&gt;And nobody in here, few people in here, think it’s acceptable to be tethered to a computer walking in here and sitting down, few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something, because we’re all social people at heart. Even introverts are social people, we like people and we want to interact. It has to be that it’s likely that AR, of the two, is the one the largest number of people will engage with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyxSDF"&gt;I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you, a lot of us live on our smartphones, the iPhone, I hope, is very important for everyone, so AR will become really big. VR I think is not going to be that big, compared to AR. I’m not saying it’s not important, it is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mfq3v"&gt;I’m excited about VR from an education point of view, I think it can be really big for education, I think it can be very big for games. But I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me. But I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now, if the technology was there, which it’s not today. How long will it take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wx2VTE"&gt;AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there. But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="d6ivZT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-virtual-reality-theres-no-substitute-f#.qel1aEjdb"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while “VR has some interesting applications,” AR is superior to VR because “there’s no substitute for human contact. And so you want the technology to encourage that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LWV7WX"&gt;Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might ... have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. ... You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8zwWMG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2017: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-tim-cook-boss-brexit-uk-theresa-may-number-10-interview-ustwo-a7574086.html"&gt;expands his thoughts on AR’s potential&lt;/a&gt;, adding a new comparison: AR is a big idea, like the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qlZDkX"&gt;I’m excited about augmented reality because unlike virtual reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what’s happening presently. Most people don’t want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can’t do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHlQnM"&gt;I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that’s why I get so excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ywuu2K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-15/apple-s-tim-cook-on-donald-trump-the-homepod-and-the-legacy-of-steve-jobs"&gt;wide-ranging interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook details his vision for AR at Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b2MVpL"&gt;I think it is profound. I am so excited about it, I just want to yell out and scream. The first step in making it a mainstream kind of experience is to put it in the operating system. We’re building it into iOS 11, opening it to ­developers—and unleashing the creativity of millions of people. Even we can’t predict what’s going to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5fDe2"&gt;There’s some things that you can already get a vision of. We’ve talked to IKEA, and they have 3D images of their furniture line. You’re talking about changing the whole experience of how you shop for, in this case, furniture and other objects that you can place around the home. You can take that idea and begin to think this is something that stretches from enterprise to consumer. There’s not a lot of things that do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hboXPl"&gt;You’ll see things happening in enterprises where AR is ­fundamental to what they’re doing. You’re going to see some consumer things that are unbelievably cool. Can we do everything we want to do now? No. The technology’s not complete yet. But that’s the beauty to a certain degree. This has a runway. And it’s an incredible runway. It’s time to put the seat belt on and go. When people begin to see what’s possible, it’s going to get them very excited—like we are, like we’ve been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DIea6k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; At an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590323"&gt;event at Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, Cook responds to a student who asks what technology he would consider “transformative.” Cook says there are widespread uses for AR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYUKHM"&gt;“I’m incredibly excited by AR because I can see uses for it everywhere. I can see uses for it in education, in consumers, in entertainment, in sports. I can see it in every business that I know anything about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JpVYm"&gt;“I also like the fact that it doesn’t isolate. I don’t like our products being used a lot. I like our products amplifying thoughts and I think AR can help amplify the human connection. I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite. There are clearly some cool niche things for VR but it’s not profound in my view. AR is profound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJlluP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In an &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-future-of-fashion-augmented-reality"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vogue UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says while Apple wasn’t looking to build a “giant database of clothes,” it would support companies in the AR space who were doing this work. “If you think about a runway show in the fashion world, that’s a great application of AR because some of these, you want to see the dress all the way around, you do not want to just see the front,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, noting how many runway shows are livestreamed and not just visible to an in-person audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBEvu6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;introduction of its ARKit platform on iOS 11&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says in a quarterly earnings call that &lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/the-transcript-of-todays-opening-statement-from-apples-ceo-on-fiscal-q4-2017-is-now-available.html"&gt;Apple has created&lt;/a&gt; the world’s largest augmented reality platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GdJYqz"&gt;There already are over a thousand apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of app aimed at consumers, students and business users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RV7Y54"&gt;Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever. We’re already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine from the human body to the solar system. And of course you experience them like you’re really there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je9Rb6"&gt;Instantly education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase – or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to change everything&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DM0tys"&gt;This is not quite what came to pass (more on that later). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJAyaa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-ARKit launch, Cook admits he &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-iphone-tim-cook-interview-features-new-augmented-reality-ar-arkit-a7993566.html"&gt;thinks AR technology&lt;/a&gt; for headsets or glasses isn’t yet up to par as far as Apple is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag0KHY"&gt;“I can tell you the technology itself doesn’t exist to do that in a quality way. The display technology required, as well as putting enough stuff around your face — there’s huge challenges with that. The field of view, the quality of the display itself, it’s not there yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMoVt4"&gt;“We don’t give a rat’s about being first, we want to be the best, and give people a great experience. But now anything you would see on the market any time soon would not be something any of us would be satisfied with. Nor do I think the vast majority of people would be satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvKmAY"&gt;“Most technology challenges can be solved, but it’s a matter of how long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiQf8M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/02/01/apple-inc-appl-q1-2018-earnings-conference-call-tr.aspx"&gt;Apple’s Q1 earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Cook describes “great excitement” around augmented reality among customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5QNWq"&gt;“Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices, and with ARKit, we’re giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yOGiC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;NowThisNews&lt;/em&gt; during an interview about Apple’s Watch that AR is poised to become indispensable. “I think that one day we will wonder how we ever lived without it,” Cook says of AR. “We can have a much more enhanced conversation with the power of AR.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZOOfV"&gt;“The future is now,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EZs5TM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vX9xBB_vBsc?rel=0&amp;amp;start=433" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VO88JU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2020: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/tim-cook-ar-war-ducks-healthtech"&gt;Cook tells an audience in Dublin, Ireland&lt;/a&gt; that augmented reality “is the next big thing” and that it will “pervade our entire lives.” He gives an example of a company using AR and described its potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImgYq0"&gt;Yesterday, I visited a development company called War Ducks … in Dublin – 15 people and they’re staffing up and using AR for games. You can imagine, for games it’s incredible but even for our discussion here. You and I might be talking about an article and using AR we can pull it up, and can both be looking at the same thing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDw6RA"&gt;I think it’s something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5lTJJO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2021:&lt;/strong&gt; During an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;interview with journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; Cook agreed with her that augmented reality is “a critically important part of Apple’s future.” He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsfUXn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2021:&lt;/strong&gt; In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/UU6MtPwT_5c?t=547"&gt;an interview with tech YouTuber iJustine&lt;/a&gt;, Cook said that he was AR’s number one fan and reiterated his hopes for it as a collaboration tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nqOlVs"&gt;I am so excited about AR. I think AR is one of these very few profound technologies that we will look back on one day and went, how did we live our lives without it? And so right now you can experience it in thousands of ways using your iPad or your iPhone, but of course, those will get better and better over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfPD0k"&gt;Already it’s a great way to shop, it’s a great way to learn. It enhances the learning process. I can’t wait for it to be even more important in collaboration and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBwShJ"&gt;So I’m AR fan number one. I think it’s that big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoCvwM"&gt;After a comment from Justine about the future impact of AR, he continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JFbx8T"&gt;I mean, simple things today that you can use it for, like if you’re shopping for a sofa, or a chair, or a lamp, in terms of really experiencing it in your place, we’ve never been able to do that before until the last couple years or so. And that’s at the early innings of AR. It will only get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NExGsI"&gt;What’s Apple’s plan for AR?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MZhJMH"&gt;Clearly, Tim Cook has been bullish on AR for a long time. But so far, Apple’s biggest foray into AR remains the 2017 launch of ARKit — which use iPhones’ and iPads’ cameras and sensors to overlay images in 3D space when the device is pointed at a given area — for iOS 11. ARKit is available across Apple’s devices, which meant a lot of &lt;a href="https://github.com/olucurious/Awesome-ARKit"&gt;cool little projects&lt;/a&gt; by amateur AR enthusiasts. When ARKit launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the tech had the potential to allow Apple to catch rival Google in the AR space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv9YB6"&gt;But despite the interesting early projects, ARKit hype fizzled after a few months. It’s not totally clear why, because it was released at the height of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; craze when AR finally had a popular mass-market application for a devoted fan base. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;itself is still wildly profitable&lt;/a&gt;, raking in a billion dollars a year on average, but we haven’t seen a larger movement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikGTfK"&gt;Since ARKit, Apple has made other, smaller steps forward with AR apps for the iPhone. In May 2019, it introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/14/statue-of-liberty-ar-ios-app/"&gt;Statue of Liberty AR app&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1128412203932049408"&gt;Cook tweeting&lt;/a&gt;, “The Statue of Liberty app is just the beginning of how AR will transform the way we connect with our world’s treasures.” In July 2019, it introduced augmented reality art sessions for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh9exC"&gt;In addition to Tim Cook’s constant cheerleading of the technology, there are other signs that Apple is moving toward an AR future. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natbro/status/1155849145350909954"&gt;hiring of people like Nat Brown&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Microsoft; listing &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/01/apple-lists-ar-vr-jobs-reportedly-taps-executive-who-finalizes-products/"&gt;dozens of AR and VR job postings&lt;/a&gt;; acquisitions including &lt;a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/28/apple-buys-german-augmented-reality-firm-metaio/"&gt;Metaio in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15877520/apple-sensomotoric-instruments-acquisition-ar-vr-eye-tracking"&gt;SensoMotoric in 2017&lt;/a&gt;; and patents on things like “&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=09383582&amp;amp;SectionNum=1&amp;amp;IDKey=4E2221DF6AD9&amp;amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=9,383,582.PN.%2526OS=PN/9,383,582%2526RS=PN/9,383,582"&gt;head mounted display&lt;/a&gt;” devices all demonstrate its steady progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WuEKr7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s AR hardware is perennially two years away&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbknTJ"&gt;Reports started &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-augmented-reality-vr-virtual-reality-headset-powered-by-a-wireless-wigig-hub/"&gt;trickling out in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had a timeline to launch both an AR headset and AR glasses. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses"&gt;The company had 1,000 engineers&lt;/a&gt; working on its VR and AR initiative — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-04/apple-augmented-reality-headset-executive-leaves-company"&gt;codenamed “T288”&lt;/a&gt; — which were expected to include a combined VR and AR headset to be released in 2021 or 2022, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, with a pair of sleeker AR glasses predicted to launch in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqsIdJ"&gt;The latest reporting from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-ar-vr-headset-will-need-connection-to-other-device-such-as-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;however, indicates that an Apple AR / VR headset may need to rely on the processor of another connected device like an iPhone (similar to the early Apple Watch models), and that Apple is working on a custom chip for the helmet-like headset that might take at least another year to arrive. Some aren’t as bullish on the glasses-like variant either; &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; suggests Apple could still release that in 2023, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks&lt;/a&gt; a 2025 release is more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2d0mj"&gt;It shouldn’t be all that surprising that Apple has taken its time making AR hardware. It is, after all, the company that introduced the AirPower wireless charging pad, showed it off to the world, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;canceled the product because it wasn’t up to company standards&lt;/a&gt; — and that was just an charging accessory, not a potentially new computing paradigm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrJyTD"&gt;So it’s to be expected that Apple would take its time on an AR or VR headset. After hyping the potential for AR all this time, Cook surely doesn’t want Apple to repeat the failure of Google Glass by launching iGlasses too soon, and definitely not before the technology meets Apple’s very high bar.&lt;/p&gt;
