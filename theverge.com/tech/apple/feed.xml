    <title>Music Widget brings back the original Mac OS X iTunes widget </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBUOzLPYFsArf_EmTmaoJFxcNSY=/180x0:2226x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526721/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_5.35.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVvWck"&gt;Way back in 2005, Apple released Mac OS X Tiger, and with it, the original implementation of widgets on the Mac through its Dashboard software. One of those widgets was a now-defunct iTunes media player — but thanks to the efforts of programmer Mario Guzman, who’s recreated an &lt;a href="https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/#download"&gt;exact replica of the widget&lt;/a&gt; for modern Macs, you can once again enjoy your music in retro OS X style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWlpeF"&gt;Ironically, the new Music Widget isn’t actually a widget (at least, not in the current style of widgets introduced in last year’s macOS Big Sur,) but rather a standalone app that mimics the look of the original iTunes widget from 2005. The app is fully functional, offering the same controls as the original. Music Widget only works with the Apple Music app, though— Spotify (or other music apps) won’t work with the widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5UzDpD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alright nerds. I have an early beta version of my Music Widget up for download. Let me know what you think. Retweets/screenshots are welcome.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/51sfimm7LI"&gt;https://t.co/51sfimm7LI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mario Guzman  ️‍      (@MarioGuzman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarioGuzman/status/1408876166165893122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pCWRTu"&gt;Guzman’s replica also draws most of the artwork and UI elements directly in code, instead of using images, so you’re not stuck with 2005-era visuals on the widget when running on a pixel-dense Retina display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="R2X14x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Listen to Spotify on this nostalgic iPod-style web music player","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="L6rCTI"&gt;It’s not the only retro-style music player to pop up recently, either: &lt;a href="https://tannerv.com/ipod/"&gt;software developer Tanner Villarete&lt;/a&gt; created a stylistically similar web app that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;offers an iPod Classic interface&lt;/a&gt; for listening to your Spotify or Apple Music library earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcZ2uj"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/#download"&gt;Music Widget is still in beta&lt;/a&gt;, and can be downloaded for free from Guzman’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to restore your iPhone from iOS 15 beta back to iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/436VxKbwU5MbJ4reDRcGvy8orFw=/0x8:1984x1331/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526531/Apple_iPhone12Pro_iOS15_3up_060721.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15 comes with a number of new features and tweaks&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iyiSDk"&gt;Beta versions of new software are great to try out, but sometimes you realize that they’re not so good for day-to-day usage. If you’ve upgraded your iPhone to the iOS 15 beta, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;now available to the public&lt;/a&gt;, and you realize that you need to go back to the stable world of iOS 14.6, you can do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33XqPZ"&gt;The simplest way to go back to a stable version is to delete the iOS 15 beta profile and wait until the next update shows up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4WWqTe"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="54TVu0"&gt;Select “Profiles and &amp;amp; Device Management”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cRK43P"&gt;Select “Remove Profile” and restart your iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UOQ9ma"&gt;Unfortunately, you won’t be able to return to a non-beta version of iOS until a new update is available. (You can check if one is available by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Software Update.”) If you don’t want to wait, you can do a more thorough recovery — it’s more complicated, but it will get you back to where you were sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WauVpJ"&gt;The first thing you have to do is put your iPhone into Recovery Mode. This is done by connecting your iPhone to your computer (making sure it’s up to date first). I tested these instructions using a MacBook Pro, but they should work using a PC as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8garSo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aA7tkf"&gt;You then begin by doing the following (the following three bulleted directions are directly quoted from &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IXr9IH"&gt;For iPhone 8 or later: Press and quickly release the Volume Up button. Press and quickly release the Volume Down button. Then, press and hold the Side button until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J5BNNc"&gt;For iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or iPod touch (7th generation): Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Volume Down buttons at the same time. Don’t release the buttons when you see the Apple logo. Continue to hold both buttons until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zQq1vM"&gt;For iPhone 6s and earlier, iPad with Home button, or iPod touch (6th generation or earlier): Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time. Don’t release the buttons when you see the Apple logo. Continue to hold both buttons until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="57A5kp"&gt;Whichever iPhone you have, once you follow the above directions, you should see a symbol showing a cable connecting to a computer on your iPhone. Turn your attention to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Pi5yOq"&gt;There will be a notice asking if you want to update, restore, or cancel. Select “Restore.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JZEKOWpGch4GGahwRN0LFab78Qg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692236/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.25.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="4UZSYp"&gt;You’ll be asked whether you’re sure you want to restore your phone since you’re about to wipe out any personalization and go back to factory settings. Select “Restore and Update.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2R7InZ5sccPfHMZ-aIdh3y0B6WA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692200/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.29.45_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Yd7dQP"&gt;You’ll be told that you’re going to be updated to iOS 14.6 (which is the most recent version of iOS 14). Select “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K6zyi6YMqLVBuLycYtwiiGf4cO4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692209/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.30.49_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="inW1XG"&gt;At this point, you’ll be asked to agree to all of the various licensing data that you agreed to last time that you began using your iPhone. Click on “Agree.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8EazkH"&gt;You’ll then be told that your computer is downloading the software for the iPhone. It should take a while, maybe 15 minutes or so, depending on your system and your network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCF3CvoTljUMX6uPz8AtFFdMsfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692218/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.31.15_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vNZJFp"&gt;Once the OS has been downloaded, you’ll be told that it is being installed on your phone (and the phone will visibly begin uploading the software and will probably restart once or twice). When it’s done, you’ll be told via your computer screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-C3RRC8o0Cul_zf74wV-zJwICAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692231/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.40.31_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VlJLnE"&gt;Okay, now you should have restored your iPhone back to iOS 14.6. That’s all well and good, but you’ve got what is essentially a clean slate — you want to restore all your apps, personalization, and other stuff, right? This is where your backup comes in. (You &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; back up your phone before you installed the iOS 15 beta, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fGHQsR"&gt;You’ll be asked if you want to set up your iPhone using the settings from another phone. If you’ve got another with all of your settings on it, well and good — just follow the directions. But assuming that you’re going to restore from a backup, tap on “Set Up Manually.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iWdY5K"&gt;At this point, you’ll enter your Wi-Fi connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TvcyXT"&gt;You then choose how you want to restore your backup: from iCloud, from a Mac or PC, from an iPhone, or from an Android phone. You can also decide not to transfer any data at all. Let’s assume you’ve backed up to iCloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0iv157"&gt;Once you’ve made that choice, you’ll be asked to enter your Apple ID name and password and to enter a verification code sent to your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xePpsP"&gt;If you’ve made more than one backup recently, you’ll be able to choose which. (Hopefully it will not be a backup from iOS 15, which will not be transferable.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q3K0a4"&gt;Once you’ve chosen your backup, it will be transferred to your iPhone, and you should be back where you started before you installed iOS 15. You should be able to use your iPhone fairly quickly; however, it will take a few minutes before everything is uploaded from your backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="er2aC6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An intrepid YouTuber created a handheld that runs macOS Big Sur</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7EQYUaNMcI552o163fDNHO60rwY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526150/big_sur.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Iketsj/YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hcbhu"&gt;Have you ever been using a recently updated Mac computer and thought, “Man, I would love to use this operating system with a really tiny keyboard and a really tiny screen?” Okay, me neither, but I certainly would love the opportunity to carry a MacBook around in my pocket and whip it out on command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OD6MQ8"&gt;Apparently, YouTuber Ike T. Sanglay Jr., or “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS6wGHldCdaA1mtfXWHJ8yA"&gt;Iketsj,”&lt;/a&gt; has had this thought as well. In this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdsdrqA-50"&gt;eight-minute vlog&lt;/a&gt;, the YouTuber builds a tiny handheld PC that can run macOS Big Sur, and it’s very fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s7ETa"&gt;The PC includes a LattePanda Alpha SBC (single board computer) with an Intel Core m3 CPU and 8GB of RAM, as well as an Arduino Leonardo microcontroller board, a 240GB SATA SSD with the operating system preinstalled, and a 3D-printed case (of course). Watch as Sanglay winds cables, cleans screens, cuts screws, and plugs things into ports. The device comes together slowly but surely, to the tune of some serene music that’s much catchier than a YouTube background tune has any business being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibqp2v"&gt;Sanglay eventually boots the thing up, and sure enough, macOS Big Sur is there. The battery indicator doesn’t appear to be working, but the interface otherwise seems fully operational in the limited footage we see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7QsU4"&gt;Now, does this device have a real purpose in the working world? Probably not, and its creator admits as much. “Maybe you’ll say that the handheld macOS is not practical, yada yada yada. Well, sure, you’re right. I just want to make one for myself,” Sanglay notes on camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgsyoK"&gt;The YouTuber is also fully aware that the price of the parts required for this stunt comes out to more than the price of an actual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;M1 Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;. “I know, but where’s the fun in that?” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJDT8v"&gt;Still, as someone who’s long been an advocate of macOS in more creative and portable form factors, I am all in favor. While I can’t imagine actually using macOS on a screen this small, I love the idea of being able to carry its powerful functionality around in such a small package. Plus, it’s just a cute little device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ak606o"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cdsdrqA-50?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=305&amp;amp;start=305" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Twitch’s Watch Parties feature is rolling out to Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PGx-W9wEOMnHE30ccmH7uaW45YU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525666/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9zopfG"&gt;Amazon-owned Twitch is rolling out its Watch Parties feature, which lets streamers host viewing parties for movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime, to Android and iOS, the company announced Wednesday. Watch Parties first launched on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418599/twitch-watch-party-rollout-global-amazon-prime-video-streaming"&gt;desktop web in September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgU6jS"&gt;While Watch Parties are a potentially fun way for Twitch streamers to hang out with their communities, there’s one important catch: only viewers who also have an Amazon Prime or Prime Video subscription &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/watch-parties?language=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Watch_Parties_M4&amp;amp;_branch_match_id=763455050422471806&amp;amp;utm_medium=Help+Page&amp;amp;utm_source=Creator+Updates#join"&gt;can join&lt;/a&gt; the party to watch what’s being shown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEzGAE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Watch Parties are now rolling out on an Android or iOS device near you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To learn more about Watch Parties, including how to host your own, check out the help article at &lt;a href="https://t.co/YvqLMCD5c6"&gt;https://t.co/YvqLMCD5c6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5aQC9It02G"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5aQC9It02G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1410285296718028803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRV4aI"&gt;But with the expansion to Android and iOS, Twitch is offering more devices from which streamers can host Watch Parties, meaning you might see more of your favorite creators using the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWnPEr"&gt;Virtual watch parties have become popular due to the pandemic, and other streaming platforms such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21492148/disney-plus-groupwatch-friends-family-us-subscribers-scener-netflix"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307519/amazon-watch-party-prime-video-virtual-parties-streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-scener-twitch"&gt;Amazon’s Prime Video&lt;/a&gt; have introduced their own watch party features. Apple’s upcoming iOS 15 update will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;add SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you watch content with other people over FaceTime — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;as long as apps support the feature, that is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP3dqaskJRC84C50bnOQSSkyrOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525171/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyU16X"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 won’t launch fully until later in 2021, but you don’t need to be a developer to test the public beta right now. If you’re willing to risk encountering possible bugs in order to try out the new features, we’re going to walk you through the steps for installing the software. It’s a similar process for iPhone and iPad, but we’ve made separate sections for each OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TncjxD"&gt;These betas will update periodically leading up to the final release. Judging from years past, that release should be around the end of the summer, close to when Apple hosts its usual autumn hardware event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFiozr"&gt;Before we get started, here’s the usual word of warning about installing unfinished beta software: these releases may seem stable for general use, but they could contain bugs that won’t be squashed until the final releases roll out later in 2021. Also, it’s possible that some of the promised features won’t be in the beta initially. Your experience may differ from others depending on the apps you use. And finally, if you do decide to install, I suggest backing up your device’s data, in case things go badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="GE7efX"&gt;What are the new features that come with iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ajIb8j"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;new features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; include updates to FaceTime, Messages, notifications, privacy controls, and much more. FaceTime will support spatial audio and reflect the speaker’s location on-screen, with a new voice isolation ability that can remove background noise. Other changes for FaceTime include the ability to share music and videos during calls and to invite Android users to a FaceTime call with a shareable link. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;Check out Allison Johnson’s in-depth breakdown of other major updates coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="C29a2b"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4rqkT"&gt;iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4MYuU8"&gt;iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWbtK7"&gt;iPhone X, iPhone XR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gPzYC"&gt;iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xXbea7"&gt;iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="WTQtvI"&gt;iPhone SE (first and second generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jl56Ou"&gt;iPod Touch (seventh generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A0LR1r"&gt;How to install the iOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwP76L"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your phone’s Safari browser and agree to sign in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TSasnT"&gt;Select “Enroll Your Devices” within the drop-down menu at the top right of the webpage, if it automatically doesn’t route you there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pUOjHU"&gt;Select “iOS,” which is the left-most option on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to make sure that you’ve sent a backup of your phone’s content to your macOS computer, in case you need to revert to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxm87C"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then tap on it. This will bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You will get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d1bnSQ"&gt;Open the Settings app. A new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you’ll have access to the beta software download. You may need to restart your phone for the profile to activate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yJf4ys"&gt;Congrats, you did it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WEwIsU"&gt;What are the new features that come with iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Ft4C"&gt;This year’s version of iPadOS makes the homescreen more customizable, and it makes split-screen multitasking easier. The App Library feature introduced last year in iOS 14 has made its way to this new iPad software. Additionally, many of the features that Apple is bringing to iOS 15 are also coming to the tablet lineup, including more spatial audio for FaceTime, portrait mode, and SharePlay, which lets you watch TV or listen to music with others who are on the call. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;Chris Welch wrote all about the new features here&lt;/a&gt;, including a section on how iPadOS 15 “punts for another year on ‘pro’ requests,” delivering features that will appeal more generally to people instead of ones for pro-level users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pS9XwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says you can build apps on an iPad now, but devs say the reality is trickier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534902/ipad-pro-apple-swift-playgrounds-4-wwdc-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kMvcyI"&gt;What devices are supported for iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2amtEx"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gYFnXh"&gt;iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first through fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7awfUC"&gt;iPad Pro 11-inch (first through third generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nSheDn"&gt;iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q39aHn"&gt;iPad Pro 9.7-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LooIpb"&gt;iPad (fifth through eighth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0fRC4p"&gt;iPad Mini (fourth and fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gb9MY"&gt;iPad Air (second through fourth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OEDSbC"&gt;How to download the iPadOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vRB6nl"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your iPad’s Safari browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VyVf4p"&gt;Click “Enroll Your Devices” at the top of the webpage (you may need to scroll horizontally to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JizQFZ"&gt;Click “iPadOS,” which is the option that’s second from the left on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to first make a backup on your macOS computer in case you need to revert your OS to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7E9jLb"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then select it. This may bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You’ll get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vgHgoU"&gt;Open the Settings app, and a new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you should have access to the beta software download. You might need to restart your iPad first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aMnO1y"&gt;Lastly, if nothing prompts you to get started with the download, open the Settings app, head to General, then find “Software Update” to install the beta software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ndZckU4N8rhNAvTM3h79RZ4Q17Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525167/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hands-on with the public betas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RGStJw"&gt;iOS 15 and iPad 15 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;kicking off their public betas today&lt;/a&gt;, and after a few weeks with the developer betas of the new software, Apple’s OS updates feel like more of a grab bag of new features than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGHjhM"&gt;A major rethinking of either platform, this year’s updates are not. The two updates were clearly born in 2020’s norm-shattering pandemic. The feature list at WWDC and on Apple’s website wears last year’s remote-first influences firmly, from the heavy emphasis on FaceTime features to a better system for corralling notifications into “work” and “personal” buckets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCtoK8"&gt;Of course, Apple’s release cadence and insistence on major updates coming just once a year means that some of these features are arriving in what will — hopefully — be a post-pandemic return to life this fall. So it’ll be interesting to see how things like SharePlay, one of the update’s marquee features, actually shake out once people have the option to watch movies and listen to music together in person again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82OTUS"&gt;Other parts of iOS and iPadOS 15, like the overhauled Safari app or the new Maps app, feel like the kinds of more noticeable changes generally associated with Apple’s major software updates, but they’re sporadic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9D4var"&gt;The result is a software update that feels a lot quieter than Apple’s usual releases, one that — at least for now — looks to improve smaller things behind the scenes than rebuild things from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-YOwTs3Mxm7lXWTL3BFGCCtW8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689245/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iOS 15 homescreen is largely unchanged from iOS 14. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGKdwT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceTime and SharePlay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Nan3wn"&gt;The flashiest feature coming to the fall updates is SharePlay, a new Apple-wide system built on top of FaceTime for sharing TV shows, movies, music, and podcasts with friends and family even when you’re not in the same room. It’s also the most pandemic-inspired feature, an Apple product-based spin on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307583/watch-videos-movies-online-friends-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-scener-extensions"&gt;countless watch party apps and services&lt;/a&gt; that sprung up to replace movie nights over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="warmv9"&gt;SharePlay shows off how well Apple’s hardware and software services all work together: watching a TV show or listening to an album over FaceTime is seamless. But it also highlights the height of Apple’s walled garden: developers have to choose to use SharePlay — which is missing big names like Netflix and YouTube right now — and it only works on Apple hardware, despite the expansion of FaceTime and the Apple TV app to other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FEgxPx_dNvDn7GZ-gzLRUEouR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691037/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_10.11.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k8DJV1"&gt;And since content is streamed locally, everyone watching or listening has to have access to it, meaning that you can’t share an episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;with a friend who’s not a TV Plus subscriber, nor can you both watch the same movie if only one of you has purchased it from iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXcJ1T"&gt;FaceTime is also getting a wide variety of long-overdue updates that help cement it as a more viable video chatting application: a sorely needed grid view, screen sharing, a portrait mode to blur your messy background, and the ability to FaceTime with Windows and Android users (in web browsers) thanks to sharable links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGPKYn"&gt;These are all badly needed features for FaceTime, but they’re also the sort of thing that remains bewildering to have had to wait until September 2021 for, especially given the reliance on video calling over the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YfJml"&gt;Unlike SharePlay, though, the FaceTime improvements feel like the kind of thing that will remain front and center even as things start to go back to normal, although the Apple product focus and more limited feature set when compared to professional solutions like Zoom or Microsoft Teams mean that FaceTime won’t be making a play for business meetings any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tEy0Z1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZhK4nw"&gt;As is traditional for an iOS update, Apple has done some tinkering with notifications on iOS 15. Some of the smaller notifications are bigger now, and feature contact images — which might be the push to get people to actually add photos to their contacts, something that doesn’t generally exist in the real world outside of an Apple presentation in my experience. And apps that you care less about can be filtered to a new summary mode that’s delivered several times a day, instead of pinging you for each notification right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVieJE"&gt;But the bigger addition is the new Focus feature, and after only a few weeks of using it, it’s already one of my favorite features on iOS in years. On the surface, Focus is an expansion of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb feature, but instead of a blanket mute, Focus allows you to select specific apps and contacts to share notifications at specific times or specific triggers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wwnvgScnLVZ0lgi5r3_OifdHWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691389/focus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus settings (left), the expanded Do Not Disturb menu (middle), and Focus-siloed notifications (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7U7n"&gt;A “work” Focus, for example, can be set to activate when you’re on the clock and mute all notifications except from your email, Slack, and calendar apps, then automatically switch off when you’re off work. Focus modes can be triggered by specific times, locations (like when you get to your office or home from work) or when opening a specific app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="trNbrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Focus gives you real control over filtering notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRnXl4"&gt;So far, I’ve mostly just been using a “personal” focus for weekends and evenings to automatically mute any work Slacks and emails until the morning, which has been absolutely delightful. Apple’s machine learning also tries to learn from how you use your phone — for example, it suggested that I add a sports app I use a lot during “personal” time to the whitelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnjYef"&gt;And while Focus can be used in conjunction with Apple’s Screen Time feature, it’s not a totally cohesive system: for example, there’s no way to automatically disable work apps like Slack when in a “personal” Focus mode. It just shuts off notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qA9Ae"&gt;Focus also lets you assign specific homescreen pages to each Focus mode — including widgets — for even more customized experiences. It’s not a perfect system, since iOS won’t let you have duplicate icons for apps (so you can’t have Apple Music visible on both a “personal” and a “work” homescreen, for example). But I’m a big fan of the feature, since it gives me a good reason to actually set up homescreens with widgets, and helps curb the instinct to tap the Slack icon when I’m supposed to be offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg2Joz"&gt;There’s also a new kind of notification to go with Focus and the morning summary feature, called “Time Sensitive Notifications,” which can override specific notification filtering features, so you don’t miss urgent alerts from your bank, for instance. Apple has specific rules for when developers can use these, but we’ll have to wait to see how they’re actually implemented when apps get updated this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eQJ6s9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safari explores a new look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sa-F42U9akLG4HUc8T5Q-CFoKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691391/safari.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Safari’s new design, with the rearranged URL bar.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mrCBnF"&gt;Safari has been entirely redesigned in iOS 15. In terms of material changes to iOS, this is the biggest, and it’s coming to what might be the most essential application on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP04AG"&gt;For the iPhone in particular, that means an emphasis on a one-handed design that moves the URL bar to the bottom of the screen, adds a swiping gesture interface, and a tab grouping feature (which is also coming to iPadOS and macOS Monterey). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ7LM1"&gt;I’m still getting used to it, even with a few days of use under my belt, and of all the additions in the latest software update, I suspect it’ll be the most polarizing. Over a decade of muscle memory has trained my brain to reach up for the menu bar on smartphones. I get Apple’s motivation in moving it to the bottom, making it easier to reach on the increasingly large phones it makes and putting the actual content of devices front and center at the top of the screen, it’s still a change that’ll require an adjustment period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qCUCdYYVSJw438QnZ8SDpmQE4lU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689246/cgartenberg_210629_4653_003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iPadOS 15 allows for widgets on the homescreen now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j5vaNa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad multitasking: what’s a computer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="luHkRC"&gt;Overall, iPadOS 15 gets a lot of the same improvements as the iPhone update. There’s a few iPad-specific features, though, starting with two major features from iOS 14 that were oddly missing last year: widgets on the homescreen and the App Library (which comes with a spiffy animation when you open it). I still can’t explain why Apple didn’t add those features last year, but they’re extremely welcome now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4rff1"&gt;Widgets, as expected, work even better on the iPad than they do on the iPhone, given the bigger homescreen. It’s not as big of a sacrifice to give up a quarter of your homescreen for widgets when there’s still so much extra space on the screen. Apple has also added even &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; widget sizes, the biggest size of which is roughly the same area as an entire iPhone 12 display when viewed on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Despite the massive size, Widgets still have the same functionality as they do on the iPhone, meaning that they’re focused on glanceable information rather than more interactive mini applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaF2Fz"&gt;Apple is also continuing to refine multitasking on the iPad with two new additions: a multitasking icon (three dots at the top of the display) that makes it easier to use the different split-view and slide-over modes it introduced in 2019, and a “shelf” that shows all the open windows for a particular app when you open it or tap the multitasking icon. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vQ2rbcsyuXVwyn4YZJjxh2girI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691086/IMG_0008.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking on iPadOS 15 is still... a lot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MbzDBs"&gt;The new multitasking setup is better, albeit still slightly confusing. Putting a single app into split view using the new menu punts you back to the homescreen to select a second app (or the same app again) to view in split-screen mode. Apps can be dragged and dropped when you’re in the app switching window to create new split-screen or full-screen combinations. The multitasking dots light up to show which app in split-screen is in focus, which is incrementally better than the bar from before. And swiping down on the multitasking dots is now an almost home-button-like experience, closing that app and letting you select a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ndrGX"&gt;There are still a lot of ways to move things around and arrange things and keyboard shortcuts available — so much so that Apple has a new menu when you hold the globe key to view system and multitasking shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqls37"&gt;But there’s still plenty of friction here. iPadOS remains unpredictable: I’m never 100 percent sure what version of an open app or app windows will open when I tap in on my homescreen. Just opening a new window is still an opaque process that involves dragging and dropping things around in split view. Slide-over panels still live in their own, separate confusing world. Split view is still frustratingly rigid, letting you have exactly two apps open with a third visible as a slide-over panel, instead of any other configuration (like one large app on the left and two smaller ones on the right). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8yAG2j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An iPad operating system with iPad apps — and that’s just how Apple likes it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MxrfpE"&gt;Ultimately, the new multitasking and split-screen views are a refinement of the older system, rather than some grand new paradigm for how to use an iPad. Those who like the iPad’s software abilities will likely find the new additions and enhancements to those modes nice. But those who were hoping that iPadOS 15 would offer a wildly overhauled windowing system — especially in the wake of Apple’s M1 upgrade in the latest iPad Pro — are going to be disappointed. Apple may do some additional tweaks or changes before iPadOS 15 launches this fall, but it’s unlikely to do any sweeping design changes for this update. iPadOS is still firmly an iPad operating system with iPad apps, and that seems to be how Apple likes things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3jMKY"&gt;Also new is a Samsung-like “Quick Notes” feature that lets users swipe up from the bottom corner of the display or hit a keyboard shortcut and scribble down a thought, highlight text on a website, or add a link for context. Quick Notes get saved to their own category on the Notes app, and can be accessed from other Apple devices, too. They’re useful, although like many iPadOS 15 features, it’s not something you’d likely figure out how to use without outside prompting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w8vdJA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best of the rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sRILU7"&gt;As is always the case, there are dozens of bigger and smaller features coming in iOS and iPadOS, too. Here are some of the more notable ones to check out on the public beta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKJ4ez"&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive part of the updates, letting you point your camera at any handwritten or typed text to grab a phone number or email address, translate it, or pull it directly into a text field. Apple has quietly made this a system-level feature — meaning that it’s available whenever you’re viewing an image, be it in the live camera feed, an image on the web, or directly from the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="7eJg3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cDWpCArz45zoW0gA6_K0S7khj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691400/text_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Live Text on iOS 15 can capture text directly from a photo feed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbDOvr"&gt;An interesting new addition on both operating systems is a new “Shared with You” feature, which shows photos, Apple Music songs, links, Apple TV Plus content, and podcasts that were shared over iMessage in dedicated rows within those apps. The theory is that if someone texts you a nice photo or their favorite playlist, you’ll be able to see it (and respond to it) in the Photos or Music apps. The feature is unsurprisingly entirely limited to Apple services for now, so sending a Spotify song to someone won’t appear in Spotify. It also might be overestimating how often users send links to TV Plus shows to each other, but showing shared links and photos are admittedly useful (at least, when the feature works properly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F8nIP"&gt;The Weather app has an overhauled design that adds a vertical, Dark Sky-style 10-day forecast and Dark Sky-style maps for temperature and precipitation. It looks nice. Notes and Reminders are both getting hashtags for categorizing and organizing, and the Memories feature in Photos is getting completely overhauled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHpcLX"&gt;Lastly, you can now put your Memoji avatars in outfits. I have no opinion on this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4gSsb6Ov3LMeV40ABqou9nGmF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691105/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1O7u7A"&gt;A lot of the other flashy new features are things we can’t test yet. Apple’s beta is only rolling out new maps to the San Francisco Bay Area to start (although it’ll be in far more locations when the final software is out this fall). IDs and keys in Wallet will also have to wait for broader support from state governments, hotels, and workplaces before we can see how those work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3fEA5"&gt;There are also a lot of features that will have to wait for third-party developers, like Focus statuses or SharePlay in third-party apps, which also have to wait for app updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MvxOuP"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V6Offf"&gt;The most notable thing from my time with the betas, though, is how easy it is to miss the newer features. Outside of the most in-your-face updates like the larger notifications or the new Safari design, most of the updates here are quieter, behind-the-scenes features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bVfAK1"&gt;They’re things that give you more options and ways to use your devices, but they’re just that — options. Focus modes are great for those who want to use them and integrate them into their workflow, but iOS doesn’t go out of its way to advertise them or push you to use them. It’s a mature way of looking at software, and one that’s nice to see, even if it means that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 aren’t the most exciting updates ever. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model, according to internal note</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jc9msMcOm5mdjtNGvste1f9dXpM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521850/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfXTiO"&gt;Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model that will require most employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Fully remote positions will be extremely limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fST2ny"&gt;“We believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future,” said Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, in a video recording viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If we take a moment to reflect on our unbelievable product launches this past year, the products and the launch execution were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiBoeB"&gt;The news comes nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook sent out an email&lt;/a&gt; telling employees the company was rolling out a new work model that would require them to return to in-office work on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays starting in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLC88B"&gt;In the wake of that announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;Apple employees wrote a letter&lt;/a&gt; saying some employees had been forced to quit because of the policy, and asking Cook to change his stance. They asked that all teams be given the option to work remotely, noting “without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ9e0"&gt;Now, Apple is essentially denying that request, saying any remote work decisions will be made “on a case-by-case basis with any new remote positions requiring executive approval.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiEsmz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Australian regulator says Apple’s AirTag batteries are too easy for kids to access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple keychain accessory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4OuukCNGOC_M9WpDmGbu1xQS70M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513709/vpavic_4547_20210421_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JSEfOK"&gt;Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has warned buyers to keep Apple AirTags away from young children, saying it’s too easy to remove a potentially dangerous battery from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;tiny location trackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITh5Cu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/parents-urged-to-keep-apple-airtags-away-from-children-as-safety-precaution"&gt;An ACCC statement&lt;/a&gt; cautions that AirTags’ small lithium button batteries can severely injure children if they leak or become stuck in a child’s throat, nose, or ear. It raises particular concerns about Apple’s design making those batteries too readily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OzgGzC"&gt;“The ACCC is concerned that the AirTag’s battery compartment could be accessible to young children, and the button battery removed with ease. In addition, the AirTag battery compartment’s lid does not always secure fully on closing, and a distinctive sound plays when an AirTag’s lid is being closed, suggesting the lid is secure when it may not be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jQA7PQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/28/keep-airtags-away-from-children/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Australian retailer Officeworks &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/04/airtags-withdrawn-from-sale-officeworks/"&gt;removed AirTags&lt;/a&gt; from its shelves last month, citing safety concerns. Apple has since added a new warning label to AirTag packaging, and the ACCC quotes Apple as saying that AirTags are “designed to meet international child safety standards.” The agency states that it’s currently discussing safety issues with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ecouuv"&gt;Many devices — including AirTag competitors — use button batteries. Some companies make them tougher to remove; Tile trackers, for instance, &lt;a href="https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009446833-How-do-I-replace-a-battery-"&gt;require a paperclip&lt;/a&gt; or precision screwdriver to swap a battery. Australia recently introduced new, stricter overall safety rules for devices using button batteries, and Apple isn’t the only company in the ACCC’s sights. Its statement says that it’s “assessing whether there are issues with button battery safety in similar Bluetooth tracking devices,” and companies that don’t meet the new standards will have until June 2022 to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Foundation trailer teases Apple TV Plus’ ambitious sci-fi epic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mohboaJl1O-BxjVERoORRaNlhIY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513208/062821_Apple_Sneak_Peek_Foundation.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UQFAID"&gt;Last week Apple revealed that &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming sc-fi show based on a series of books by Isaac Asimov, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547252/foundation-release-date-apple-tv-plus-september"&gt;would debut on Apple TV Plus in September&lt;/a&gt;. Now we have something even better: a proper trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuYkOB"&gt;It’s the first good look at the show since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295512/apple-tv-plus-foundation-show-trailer-isaac-asimov-wwdc-2020"&gt;the debut teaser last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it reveals what looks to be an ambitious series that could give Apple’s streaming service its own must-watch epic along the lines of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. The trailer shows lavish sets, big-name stars, and, of course, a baby floating in a tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZXK69q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Foundation’ has always been at the top of my bucket list.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PygMcd"&gt;The show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223728/apple-foundation-trilogy-isaac-asimov-tv-show-david-goyer-josh-friedman"&gt;which was first announced in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, is being helmed by showrunner David S. Goyer, and stars Lee Pace and Jared Harris. According to Apple, the story “chronicles a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire.” Here’s Goyer on the adaptation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BEl1P7"&gt;In the decades since the &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; series first saw print, Asimov’s prophetic science-fiction work has never been more relevant than it is now. Growing up, I devoured &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; and dreamed of one day seeing it on screen — but a feature film didn’t seem big enough to embrace the ambition. Thanks to the broader landscape of streaming and a valuable partnership with Apple and Skydance, we are able to bring the series to the screen in a way that truly does it justice. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; has always been at the top of my bucket list and I’m honored I get to play a part in finally bringing it to life. Whether you’re a fan of the novels or simply someone craving a mind-blowing epic, I’m excited to share with you what we’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="B2hNJQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; will debut on September 24th, with the first three (of 10) episodes available initially. Subsequent episodes will debut every Friday after that. It will follow another high-profile release, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season premiering in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 12.9 Max Plus is Brydge’s best iPad keyboard yet</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The biggest trackpad you can get, if not necessarily the best&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="6xcL1r"&gt;Brydge has been making iPad keyboards for nearly a decade now, and while the iPad itself has changed a lot over that time, the company has largely followed the same formula: design a keyboard that makes the iPad look like a MacBook Pro. The key design element has been the company’s trademark rubberized hinges, which the iPad slots into to form the other half of a laptop-style device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NBjK6"&gt;Now, Brydge is trying something slightly new. The 12.9 Max Plus, which starts shipping this week, is a keyboard case for the iPad Pro that does away with the hinge clamps and instead makes use of magnets for a sleeker and more convenient experience. The product also leans hard into Apple’s recent addition of cursor support to iPadOS, with a huge trackpad that’s comparable in size to what you’d find on a MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtPHtr"&gt;At $249.99, this is a premium product aimed at heavy iPad Pro users, and it’s only available for the biggest iPad size. Apple’s own Magic Keyboard is clearly formidable competition. But Brydge is able to undercut Apple by $100, and in some important ways, I prefer the Max Plus to the Magic Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eyi6iS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10627296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="riplm7"&gt;The most obvious difference between the Max Plus and other Brydge keyboards is the magnetic plate in which you rest the iPad. This offers protection for the back of the iPad without having to attach the snap-on magnetic cover that Brydge included on prior models, and more importantly, it’s far less fiddly to attach and detach the iPad than it was to squeeze it into the old-style hinge clamps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOMG5x"&gt;The tradeoff, of course, is that you’re adding a few millimeters of thickness behind the iPad, especially if (like me) you never bothered with the magnetic protective back covers supplied with previous Brydge keyboards. With 17mm of thickness and an extra 970g of weight, the resulting 12.9-inch “laptop” you get with the Max Plus is quite a bit thicker and heavier than a 13-inch MacBook Pro. The heft does help stabilize the combination, however, and it supports a wider range of viewing angles than the Magic Keyboard while feeling much more premium. As a tall person, the Magic Keyboard doesn’t always tilt back far enough to be comfortable for me, but I don’t have a problem with this Brydge. It’s also easier to use on your lap than a kickstand-based solution, as found in many of Logitech’s iPad keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4TfDO"&gt;While the magnet mechanism is convenient, the Max Plus unfortunately doesn’t use Apple’s Smart Connector for power and connectivity. This is still a Bluetooth device that you have to charge over USB-C, though the battery should last weeks or months on a charge depending on your usage (specifically how much you use the backlight). The Smart Connector would have been preferable, but it’s only ever appeared on Apple’s own products and Logitech devices that have been designed with Apple’s cooperation; it hasn’t shown up in any Brydge products or other devices from similarly smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFASzfownXGUwv-IYVmQ4rbDR4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22685746/IMG_20210628_151930_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been testing the white version of the Max Plus, which creates an unusual sandwich effect with my space gray iPad Pro. Silver and gray options are also available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mj753N"&gt;Brydge has at least improved the Bluetooth experience in one notable way compared to most of its older products. The Max Plus has a feature called Instant-On that makes use of Bluetooth 5.0 to stay in a low-power state for up to four hours, meaning that if you step away from the iPad and come back it’ll instantly wake with a button press with no need for reconnection. That goes some way to making the combination feel more like a coherent product, because in practice you aren’t likely to find yourself running into laggy reconnection issues during a typical work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xTdfx"&gt;The keyboard itself is good. It feels a touch more responsive than previous Brydge products, but you’re not getting mechanical-level tactility here, of course — it’s just an above-average laptop keyboard. What really sets it apart when compared to Apple’s Magic Keyboard is the extra function row, which is very useful in iPadOS for things like brightness and volume control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6EipB"&gt;The trackpad is a key selling point for the Max Plus. It can’t quite match the Magic Keyboard on pure responsiveness, which is no surprise given Apple’s low-level system access, but it does a good job nonetheless, and Brydge has been making continuous improvements to the firmware. It’s a huge trackpad by any standard, which makes using it for things like photo browsing and text editing a lot more enjoyable. Even though it has a diving board-style mechanism that doesn’t let you click everywhere (particularly in the upper left and right corners), there’s more than enough space and I had no problem using it just like I would a MacBook Pro’s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUqIRlpRPwD7GiezfnjCWXV-_4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22685745/IMG_20210628_151714_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brydge Max Plus has a huge trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RE52s4"&gt;The Brydge Max Plus isn’t for everyone, but then neither are iPad keyboards in general. Even though Apple came out with a good option last year, it’s very expensive and not without its quirks. What you get with the Max Plus is a less expensive — but still quite pricey — option that, more so than any Brydge keyboard to date, gives the iPad a laptop’s form factor and functionality. It’s not as slick or as inventive as the Magic Keyboard, but it’s more useful for my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2qqMw"&gt;Brydge is really competing with itself here as much as Apple. Its previous highest end model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287000/brydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch"&gt;the 12.9 Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;, just got a significant price cut to $169.99 and offers essentially the same functionality, just with a smaller trackpad and the old hinge design. I prefer the Max Plus, but the Pro Plus is a good option if you want to save some weight and cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hd8LsO"&gt;There are still clear limitations to iPadOS, but cursor support really transformed the experience of working on an iPad, and no accessory embodies that better than the Brydge Max Plus. It’s not perfect, but right now it’s what I’d choose to get work done on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
