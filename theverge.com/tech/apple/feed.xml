    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b02GtR"&gt;The latest &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1130503/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Gold%2F430392594&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; is back at Cyber Monday-level pricing, offering the best deal possible for Apple’s most compact tablet. Walmart has it on sale today for $100 off, clocking in at $299 and matching the lowest price we’ve seen for one of the most powerful small-format tablets on the market. The 64GB Wi-Fi model is perfect for casual reading, consuming content, controlling smart home functions, or just browsing the web on the couch on a nice 7.9-inch screen. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;expected to release a new model&lt;/a&gt; this fall, but here’s a prime opportunity to save on the current version right now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6VYcoo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gNeRsw"&gt;Yesterday saw the Steam release of &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected &lt;/em&gt;on PC&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and if you plan on jumping in, it’s &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003590/Tetris_Effect_Connected/"&gt;available for 25 percent off&lt;/a&gt; through September 1st. &lt;em&gt;Connected&lt;/em&gt; is the multiplayer expansion to 2018’s critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect,&lt;/em&gt; a title known for its vivid visuals and modern interpretation of the iconic game. Prior to its launch on Steam, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected&lt;/em&gt; was exclusive to Xbox and the Windows Store, though it also recently launched on the PlayStation 4. Given the discount is only available for a limited time, now is a great time to pick it up for your Steam library, whether you plan on playing in VR or standard mode. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18076140/tetris-effect-review-ps4-vr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lKUyXi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tetris Effect: Connected is finally coming to the Switch in October","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620217/tetris-effect-connected-release-date-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="1Kzzej"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707794"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ber2Sp"&gt;If you seek a high-performing Wi-Fi 6 router — sans the arachnid-like aesthetic that gives the impression your desk has been invaded by a Decepticon — Costco is currently offering a members-only deal on the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/nighthawk-tri-band-8-stream-ax6200-wifi-6-router.product.100716346.html"&gt;Netgear Nighthawk AX6200&lt;/a&gt;. The wholesale retailer is selling the router for $100 off, bringing the price down to $200 through August 29th. In addition to its Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, which allows for speeds of up to 6.2Gbps, it has six antennas, beamforming, four LAN ports, and a USB 3.0 port. It’s a solid option if speed is your priority and your space does not call for a mesh network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qiaxG1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="313Bjn"&gt;If you’re preparing for back-to-school season, Costco has another great deal on what could be an ideal family computer. Right now, it’s selling the higher-specced &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/new-imac-24%22-with-retina-4.5k-display---apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu---8gb-memory---512gb-ssd.product.100694251.html"&gt;Apple iMac with the M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $150 off. This particular model comes packed with an eight-core GPU and 512GB of storage, offering slightly more horsepower along with twice as many USB ports as the base model. Not all colors are offered, but you can choose between silver, green, blue, and pink. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFVUcR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474631"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The four numbers Apple won’t let you engrave on your iPhone in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini has a regular wide and an ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i0KjEChXYRpIWUyntPLuKLncQIY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746379/vpavic_4279_20201107_0048.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjAvk0"&gt;Apple is censoring words and phrases customers can engrave on products in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, according to a new report by the &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/"&gt;Brussels-based CitizenLab&lt;/a&gt;. The iPhone-maker has always said it filters engraving requests to avoid racist language, vulgarities, or intellectual property violations, but CitizenLab says the company’s restrictions of political references in Hong Kong and Taiwan particularly go above and beyond legal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMMu8I"&gt;“We found that part of Apple’s mainland China political censorship bleeds into both Hong Kong and Taiwan,” &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/engrave-danger-an-analysis-of-apple-engraving-censorship-across-six-regions/"&gt;write the report’s authors&lt;/a&gt;. “Much of this censorship exceeds Apple’s legal obligations in Hong Kong, and we are aware of no legal justification for the political censorship of content in Taiwan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3S8wF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New report reveals extent of Apple’s engraving filters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SSdepm"&gt;Apple does not offer a complete list of banned phrases by region, but analysis by CitizenLab found that the company filters 1,045 keywords in China, compared to 542 in Hong Kong, 397 in Taiwan, 206 in Canada, 192 in Japan, and 170 in the United States. While no political phrases are filtered in the US, Canada, or Japan, nearly half of all blocked keywords in China and Hong Kong were political in nature. CitizenLab’s analysis looked specifically at engraving requests for AirTags and iPads, but the only differences it noted in restrictions between the products were related to keyword length and lowercase words.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL6XsgoB1Q6qDdxsYkNIjx-Kf3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792056/Image_6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/engrave-danger-an-analysis-of-apple-engraving-censorship-across-six-regions/" target="_blank"&gt;CitizenLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparisons of filtered keywords by type and region. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rReEyi"&gt;Keywords filtered in China include 政治 (politics), 抵制 (resist), 民主潮 (wave of democracy), and 人权 (human rights). For AirTag engravings, which are limited to four characters, Chinese customers are not allowed to use the four numbers 8964 — which refer to the Tiananmen Square protests, which took place on June 4th, 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moS0VZ"&gt;CitizenLab says the rigorous censorship applied in mainland China bleeds into Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hong Kong is a “special administrative region” of China that has enjoyed a high level of political independence, though China has cracked down on its democratic movements in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/briefing/china-hong-kong-apple-daily-closure.html"&gt;recent months and years&lt;/a&gt;. Taiwan, meanwhile, is a self-governing democracy that China considers to be a breakaway state that should reunite with the mainland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3j54d"&gt;In Hong Kong, banned phrases include 雙普選 (double universal suffrage), 雨伞革命 (Umbrella Revolution), and 新聞自由 (freedom of the press). In Taiwan, Apple customers are not allowed to reference high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party like 孫春蘭 (Sun Chunlan) or the banned religious movement 法輪功 (Falun Gong). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oM3WJ-Qxce9yANv1eetKbqHf3jY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792058/Image_2.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;8964: a reference to the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4 1989.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xGcWpD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there exists no legal obligation for Apple to perform such political censorship in Taiwan”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M4sAup"&gt;CitizenLab notes that “there exists no legal obligation for Apple to perform such political censorship in Taiwan.” But Apple has repeatedly showed it will make political accommodations to preserve its presence in China, which accounts for nearly a fifth of its total revenues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MabnH"&gt;The degree to which Apple is willing to bend to Chinese pressure has become particularly sensitive in recent weeks after the iPhone-maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;unveiled a controversial system&lt;/a&gt; to detect CSAM (child sexual abuse material) on its devices. The system scans users’ phones locally for the illegal material, but critics worry that it could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;expanded beyond CSAM&lt;/a&gt; to detect other forms of illegal content. In China, that could include expression of political dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2jhZH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Citizen-Lab-Letter-08172021.pdf"&gt;responded to the analysis&lt;/a&gt; by CitizenLab by saying it filters engraving requests with respect to “local laws, rules, and regulations.” It did not address any criticism that it was over-zealous in its censorship in Hong Kong and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRpSAL"&gt;“We handle engraving requests regionally. There is no single global list that contains one set of words or phrases,” said Apple’s chief privacy officer Jane Horvath, in a letter. “Instead, these decisions are made through a review process where our teams assess local laws as well as their assessment of cultural sensitivities.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is finally adding support for spatial audio on iPhone and iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XM_D44f9NbljV1x-qKqyoWDa8C0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69745027/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nw3GOK"&gt;Netflix is beginning to roll out support for Apple’s spatial audio feature on iPhone and iPad, the streaming giant &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio-support-roll-out/"&gt;said to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. A Netflix spokesperson confirmed the rollout to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;saying that the rollout begins Wednesday and that users should expect to see it over the next few days. You may have it already — some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Airpodsmax/comments/p6oiss/spatial_audio_is_now_working_on_the_netflix_app/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that it’s working for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUpUZQ"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio, which you can only take advantage of with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; on an iPhone or iPad, is designed to make you feel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;more immersed&lt;/a&gt; in what you’re listening to with an impressive surround sound effect. If you want to give spatial audio a shot and don’t have it on Netflix yet, you can try it out on other services like Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, or HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q7MQH"&gt;In the future, Apple is planning to add spatial audio &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523914/macos-tvos-spatial-audio-support-airpods-pro-max"&gt;to macOS and tvOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aTWBtPwZTKbOu1r44PjNSdICUk8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742617/akrales_201018_4238_0464.0.12.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KsLXHf"&gt;It’s been almost a year since Apple first debuted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;the iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;, and introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe accessory system&lt;/a&gt;. So where are all the MagSafe chargers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDOKq4"&gt;Don’t get me wrong. There are plenty of accessory developers making cases, wallets, car mounts, desk stands, and even magnetic Qi chargers and battery packs that &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; with MagSafe — but almost no actual MagSafe accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bp2oo1"&gt;And that’s a big difference because of how Apple has designed the MagSafe standard. Anyone can wirelessly charge an iPhone 12 device using a Qi charger at Apple’s standard rate of 7.5W. Magnets, being a physical phenomenon, are even more universal, meaning that device manufacturers can easily stick an iPhone 12 and a Qi charger together. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215639/anker-magsafe-qi-charger-apple-alternative-giant-usb-c-plug-explained"&gt;Many already have&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qN3kfAlg7EpFcCtrEkA3jsg5da4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733380/DSC02786_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bevw0"&gt;But those two things alone don’t make a wireless charger a MagSafe charger; actual, Apple-approved MagSafe chargers offer a charging speed that’s twice as fast, up to 15W. And that’s only available on a paltry handful of accessories: Apple’s official charging cable, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s official MagSafe battery pack&lt;/a&gt; (even then, only when it’s plugged in), and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265910/belkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch"&gt;pair of pricey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;Belkin stands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KS3fDO"&gt;Theoretically, there’s no reason that Apple &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to restrict 15W charging to official MagSafe chargers. Any number of Qi chargers are available that offer 15W charging speeds and work with a plethora of devices. Some of them are even made by Apple’s MagSafe-approved partners, leading to awkward product lineups where some &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fmagsafe-magnetic-accessories%2Fmagsafe%2Fboost-charge-pro-2-in-1-wireless-charger-stand-with-magsafe-15w%2Fp%2Fp-wiz010%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe-capable 15W chargers&lt;/a&gt; sit side by side on a website with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fchargers%2Fwireless%2Fcharging-stands-docks%2Fboost-charge-magnetic-wireless-charger-stand-7-5w%2Fp%2Fp-wib003%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;identical-looking 7.5W, MagSafe-compatible wireless chargers&lt;/a&gt; that won’t charge your phone as fast.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_18Q9UHe7v_NvLYlHc2hVQdvL54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788687/webdam.web.1000.1000.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GIDwlhonrFGCRfdMXc42emXLDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788689/webdam.web.1000.1000__1_.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Belkin charger has magnets, costs $35, and charges an iPhone 12 at 7.5W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fB2GVg"&gt;The reason appears to be simple: &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/apple-starts-15w-magsafe-wireless-charging-certification/"&gt;Apple hasn’t actually let anyone else&lt;/a&gt; make MagSafe chargers yet. &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/apple-starts-15w-magsafe-wireless-charging-certification/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;ChargerLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a wireless-charging-focused site that’s obtained details and a unit for Apple’s MagSafe modules — Apple is only allowing MagSafe chargers to be built using &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/teardown-of-apple-official-15w-magsafe-module/"&gt;an MFi-approved module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ooeeb"&gt;Much like the Apple Watch charger (and to some extent, Lighting cables), Apple works with factories to provide the basic parts here, which developers can then integrate into a charging station or mount. Technically, there’s not a huge difference between offering a slot for a MagSafe cable versus the integrated module; the advantage is largely in size and cost, allowing for accessories that are smaller, cheaper, and nicer to use than the awkward, kludged-together options we have today. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnqAn7VxyxBOup03H8QBLPG85ec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788701/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_5.56.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/dont-let-third-parties-confuse-you-about-apples-magsafe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ChargerLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image of Apple’s MagSafe module for device makers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2KTD7A"&gt;But crucially, the company only announced that it would be offering the modules &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/apple-starts-15w-magsafe-wireless-charging-certification/"&gt;on June 22nd&lt;/a&gt;, almost nine months after the iPhone 12 launched. Hardware developers were only then able to apply to get their hands on samples and apply to get true MagSafe products approved (which will presumably take even more time), followed by actually manufacturing and shipping those accessories, which could take months by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gR8Sx1"&gt;It’s a similar timetable that we’ve seen with other proprietary Apple chargers. Apple didn’t offer developers the option to build their own integrated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; products &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/23/9023443/apple-watch-charging-stands-mfi-program"&gt;until July 2015&lt;/a&gt;, four months after the Watch hit the market, and it took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/26/12271108/diskus-apple-watch-cable-third-party-charger"&gt;almost a year after that&lt;/a&gt; until the first third-party products arrived with the proprietary charger built in. Those products have proven to be excellent options for consumers, offering functionality that Apple didn’t, like integration with other wireless charging pads, removable cables, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/zens-apple-watch-power-bank/"&gt;or a built-in power bank&lt;/a&gt;. But because of how Apple’s system works, it took months for them to arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07iaLL"&gt;Or take USB-C to Lightning cables, where Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13524272/apple-cutting-usb-c-adaptor-prices-macbook-pro"&gt;first started selling&lt;/a&gt; its own models in fall of 2016 — but only opened the gates to developers &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/04/mfi-lightning-to-usb-c-cables-early-2019/"&gt;in December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, with the first cables showing up a few months later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/15/18183251/anker-usb-c-to-lightning-cables-release-date"&gt;in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1m8ul"&gt;Each time, that slow start has had direct consequences: a lack of diversity and competition in the products you can buy. Apple’s virtual monopoly on accessories in the first months or years means customers have fewer — and worse — options for their brand-new iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSNFXr"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231718/magsafe-car-chargers-apple-iphone-certification-process"&gt;still no MagSafe car mounts&lt;/a&gt; that will charge your iPhone 12 at full speed, even a year after launch — perhaps the most blindingly obvious use of MagSafe. The closest Apple-sanctioned accessory is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22387722/apple-magsafe-belkin-car-vent-mount-pro-review-no-charger"&gt;magnetic car mount&lt;/a&gt; that just holds up (but doesn’t charge) your phone. And if you want a MagSafe charger for your desk or nightstand that can prop your iPhone up, you’re limited to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zagg.com%2Fen_us%2F3-in-1-wireless-charging-stand-magsafe-apple-exclusive%3Fcpn%3D12608711214%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw3_KIBhA2EiwAaAAlimkyPkeNamF7rAVdkW8eCMAHyfvjyAeo2y9m2RW2yf7UOV3mIn4WHxoCJbQQAvD_BwE%26kw%3D%26mkwid%3D_dc%26pcrid%3D509075182700%26pkw%3D%26pmt%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bulkier workarounds&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Fforte-for-iphone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that require&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/products/magsafe-mount-silver" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;threading through&lt;/a&gt; an existing Apple-bought cable (or Belkin’s two options, which are usually even pricier). Apple spent the better part of the year without giving access to developers to build their own products, while also not working to build anything on its own to fill those niches, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B1PBRs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Six months later, there still isn’t a MagSafe car charger","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22387722/apple-magsafe-belkin-car-vent-mount-pro-review-no-charger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iML5YK"&gt;And while developers can try to keep up with Apple, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297307/anker-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack-apple-iphone"&gt;Anker’s MagSafe-compatible battery pack&lt;/a&gt;, they’re not playing on a level field without access to the MagSafe modules that Apple is rationing out. Forget Apple’s software additions that make its MagSafe battery pack more useful than a third-party option: right now, Apple’s pack is the only one that can even charge an iPhone at full speed, and even then, only while it’s plugged in with specific adapters and capable cords. It’s the sort of area where competition could lead to better products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vyr6PY"&gt;Maybe a third-party can figure out a way to provide full-speed charging from a battery pack that Apple didn’t, or simply offer things at a lower price point or with a larger battery than Apple’s pack offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0DNzDx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Proprietary Apple chargers are nothing new&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VyjqMY"&gt;That, of course, assumes that Apple even lets competitors make officially approved MagSafe battery packs. The company’s MFi program means that developers have to get their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/21/3793488/apple-changes-iphone-accessory-guidelines-is-not-standing-in-the-way-of-pop-accessory"&gt;hardware approved by Apple&lt;/a&gt; and be built using Apple-approved parts from Apple-approved factories. (Apple also gets a fee from each product, of course.) And if the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/20/3789504/kickstarter-charger-pop-turns-to-competitor-to-process-refunds-apple"&gt;company doesn’t like a design&lt;/a&gt;, it can simply &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revokes-monsters-authority-to-make-licensed-accessories-1434481512"&gt;withhold its seal of approval&lt;/a&gt; and the necessary parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWrz29"&gt;Of course, proprietary Apple chargers are nothing new, and while today’s MagSafe licensing feels slow, it’s better than things used to be. The original iteration of MagSafe on laptops wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/185781/magsafe.html"&gt;licensed out to third party companies&lt;/a&gt; at all: if you wanted a spare charger or to charge your Mac from an external battery pack, you were pretty much out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAlVX5"&gt;The most famous example of this is accessory maker Sanho, which famously bought $79 MagSafe chargers, disassembled them, and used the original cable to allow Mac owners to charge their computers with its &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/202098/hypermacbatteries.html"&gt;HyperMac batteries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/09/apples-magsafe-lawsuit-tests-limits-of-first-sale-doctrine/"&gt;Apple then sued Sanho&lt;/a&gt;, which was forced to come up with a workaround that instructed customers to buy their own chargers and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/hypermac-sidesteps-apple-patent-headache-with-diy-solutions/?comments=1"&gt;modify the cables themselves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EH87fY"&gt;But a year out, it’s hard to feel like MagSafe isn’t a missed opportunity for Apple. When the iPhone 12 first came out, MagSafe looked like a way for the company to build an ecosystem of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21515490/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-accessories-ecosystem"&gt;snap-on modular accessories&lt;/a&gt;, the sort of thing that Motorola had tried and failed to accomplish with its Moto Mods system. There were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515789/apple-portless-iphone-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;visions of port-less iPhones&lt;/a&gt; that could rely on MagSafe exclusively for charging and connecting to external devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnO5e8"&gt;But instead of that thriving new accessory ecosystem, Apple has effectively left us with a handful of Apple-designed cables. It makes Apple’s magnetic standard look less like a stepping stone to the portless future, and more like another brick in Apple’s walled garden. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to turn off unwanted ‘memories’ in Apple Photos, Google Photos, and Facebook </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3gsmAx8Ipp_Y86f-eylq2xg2n1o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742560/akrales_191007_3710_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbCiHm"&gt;The memory machines that Apple, Facebook, and Google have built to remind us of our favorite moments can, like any algorithmic creation, serve up subpar output. Instead of evoking recollections of those times we felt like we were living our best lives, they can invoke the low points of our existence — a miserable job, a rotten commute, a bad breakup, or the death of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7iGuo"&gt;Apple Photos, Facebook, and Google Photos provide tools to manage what their “memories” features can push out to you. But these settings to control what pictures and posts get algorithmically bubbled up to your screen aren’t always easy to find — even, in some situations, after these apps have presented a gut-punch of a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdElfi"&gt;Here’s how to control, at least in part, what memories you will see in each of these apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9nb5kG"&gt;Apple Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="smUYpj"&gt;If you’re using iOS 14, Apple’s implementation of its &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207023"&gt;Memories feature&lt;/a&gt; provides less control compared to those offered by the other two companies here. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;once you move to iOS 15 later this year&lt;/a&gt;, that should change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oYB2YS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On an iOS 14 device:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="THgyn0"&gt;If Photos presents you with a memory you’d rather avoid, long-press the video or photo and then tap on the “Suggest Fewer Memories Like This” button below the photo… and hope for the best, as iOS 14 does not provide options to exclude certain people or dates from its Memories feature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OjTPK9"&gt;You can also go to the “For You” section of Photos (found at the bottom of your screen), find the photo or video you want to avoid, and long-press it to get the same menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uC9kvj"&gt;To stop Photos from notifying you of new Memories, open the Settings app, select “Notifications” &amp;gt; “Photos” &amp;gt; “Memories” and toggle off “Allow Notifications.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6Nv1wW"&gt;If you’ve added the Photos widget to your iPhone’s homescreen, pictures from your Featured Photos memory collection can also show up there. To remove one from that list, tap and hold it until a menu appears, then scroll down and tap on “Remove from Featured Photos.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DP18bP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On an iOS 15 device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBNBRm"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;upcoming iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; operating system adds an option to feature a particular person less often in Memories, or delete that person entirely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OWywTa"&gt;In the Photos app, tap on the Albums icon at the bottom of the screen, and then tap on People (under “People &amp;amp; Places”). Select the person whose Memories you want to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="spWHT5"&gt;Tap on the three dots at the top right. You’ll get a pop-up menu that lets you, among other things, feature that person less or remove them from the “People” list entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rLADi6"&gt;If you tap on “Feature This Person Less,” you’ll get two choices: to feature that person less in Memories or never feature them at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ciZr9H"&gt;If you tap on “Remove This Person from People,” you’ll be invited to reset the people album, which will clear it of all names and favorites from all your iCloud-connected devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iOS 15 will offer more say over your Memories." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WodsTmSXw1SSvm6I7SFfdY-C6pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788062/IMG_A114459CB882_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15 will offer more say over your Memories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can feature a person less, or never feature them again." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rbtFj1USRmXeghawzrtXWEAnNnQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788065/IMG_53D5B76DA8FF_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can feature a person less or never feature them again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3F0tcN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a Mac &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="McA7an"&gt;Right-click on the photo and select “Suggest Fewer Memories Like This” to get fewer such reminders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ICByer"&gt;To stop the operating system from notifying you of new Memories, go to the Photos menu at the top left-hand corner of the screen, select “Preferences…” and under the “General” tab, uncheck the box next to “Show Memories Notification.” You can also uncheck “Show Holiday Events” if holiday photos are a special irritation for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Right-click on a photo to suggest that it no longer appear in your Memories." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s4FK3lw6I7Pr_XmWBZUFXceuiAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788111/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_2.16.25_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right-click on a photo to suggest that it no longer appear in your Memories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tjsxcc"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="e9jrsn"&gt;The social network took a few months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/24/8284703/facebook-on-this-day-nostalgia-recap"&gt;launching its nostalgia inducer as “On This Day” in 2015&lt;/a&gt; to add the ability to filter out people or dates. The tool has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/25/16202094/facebook-on-this-day-update-seasonal-monthly-recap-memories"&gt;built out since then&lt;/a&gt; and is now called Memories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krRmIt"&gt;You can use either the web app or the mobile app to change your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Hsehnl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The web app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wIJEta"&gt;Select “Memories” in the left-hand column (you may have to click on “See More” to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lAcQfV"&gt;Click on “Hide People” or “Hide Dates” on the left. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RVP2Yr"&gt;Tap the menu icon at the top right (Android) or bottom right (iOS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UVmN8y"&gt;Tap “Memories” and then the gear icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cNFkDq"&gt;Look under “Hide Memories” and select “People” or “Dates.”&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll find Memories in the menu after tapping the three parallel lines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Besides hiding people or dates, you can choose how often to be notified about Memories." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8C8A27tTKSNT3SV2B7BWeaA3Nc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788187/Screenshot_20210817_144739.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Besides hiding people or dates, you can choose how often to be notified about Memories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="762bAN"&gt;Whether you’re on a mobile device or a desktop, you can now type in the names of any people you don’t want in your Memories, or any dates you want to exclude. Note when you type in a name, you may sometimes get public pages or profiles of random strangers before you get the names of friends — at least, that was my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrGLNs"&gt;One item you can’t exclude from Memories: posts from other people who tagged you in them. (Consider this paragraph a feature request, Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4nPVW"&gt;The Memories settings screens also let you regulate how often Facebook notifies you of new Memories: a maximum of once a day, algorithmically chosen highlights, or never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orhdTM"&gt;Google Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1m6c"&gt;The Memories feature Google added to Google Photos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20860938/google-photos-memories-prints-cvs-walmart-canvas"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; also offers options to hide people (and pets) or dates from your notifications of past events that bubble up in its mobile apps. The Photos web app doesn’t offer those settings because it doesn’t push notifications to your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g51Klu"&gt;On the mobile Google Photos app, tap the account-profile picture at the top right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="07qt64"&gt;Tap “Photos settings” (in Android) or “Google Photos Settings” (on Apple devices). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7fSqQk"&gt;Tap “Memories.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E08zPw"&gt;Tap “Hide people &amp;amp; pets” to remove one from these flashbacks. This will be easier if you’ve already added names to the faces that Google Photos automatically recognizes and classifies. And if Google Photos misses a picture of somebody — say, if it was taken at a strange angle or in poor light — it can still resurface in Memories. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oI8skK"&gt;The “Hide dates” tool (also on the “Memories” page) is far simpler. Tap “Hide Dates,” and select the day or days you want gone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aRqYt5"&gt;To have Google Photos stop notifying you about some or all Memories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Hk1L0h"&gt;Tap the “Notifications” link on the Memories page. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vcwueM"&gt;On the next page, look for the “Memories” section. Here, you can opt out of having Google Photos nudge you about on-this-day memories from previous years or “Themed memories” (like the “They grow up so fast” compilations of pictures of my daughter that it somehow knows to push when a work trip has me away from my family).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Photos’ Memories page lets you hide people, pets, or dates." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t3uUtWqFg22cjzULDTdKIXCEKm0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788245/Screenshot_20210817_145034.png"&gt;

    <title>Apple’s attempt at podcast subscriptions is off to a messy start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIGttswlXfR_80Vgi4KPGb_bWMA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742072/acastro_210817_4721_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Bugs and design flaws&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HH7MKN"&gt;In April, Apple Podcasts was poised to revolutionize the industry. It announced in-app subscriptions, as well as an entirely new backend, representing one of the most monumental changes to the app since its launch. The hype was easy to understand: the biggest name in podcast apps legitimizing subscriptions could usher in a new podcasting era, one in which ad revenue plays a less essential role and more people could potentially support themselves off their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIttFg"&gt;But in the months since Apple Podcasts’ announcement, podcasters say the platform has failed them in various ways. For a company that prides itself on functionality, design, and ease of use, the new backend’s bungled launch is a mess. Podcasters say Apple Podcasts Connect, which they’re required to use in order to take advantage of subscriptions, has a confusing interface that often leads to user error scenarios that have them pinging Apple at all hours of the day in a panic — one podcaster’s entire show was seemingly archived until Apple stepped in to help and explain what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXR3se"&gt;The updated app’s been buggy since launch. Earlier this summer, an &lt;a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/1418-a-notice-about-download-reports"&gt;auto-download bug&lt;/a&gt; caused a reported 31 percent drop in downloads, according to &lt;a href="https://analytics.podtrac.com/blog/2021/8/9/monthly-podcast-traffic-update-for-july-2021"&gt;Podtrac&lt;/a&gt;. People who relied on Apple to download new episodes for them might have missed them entirely. (The company &lt;a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/1488-whats-new-for-apple-podcasts-with-ios-147"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an update last month that reportedly fixed it, but that solution hinges on people actually updating their app.) Listeners &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/users-despair-at-apple-podcasts-app-after-update/"&gt;also complained&lt;/a&gt; about problems with the app update in April — some say podcasts they had already heard flooded their libraries, and they also had problems syncing their podcasts across devices. It culminated in a slightly delayed launch of the subscription product, pushing it from May to June, some updates, and no public word from Apple on why everything went so wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="99J7qQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple hasn’t offered an explanation for the bugs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JzjELQ"&gt;Worse than bugs, however, podcasters say the subscription push comes with a new labor cost that not all of them can afford to address. The promise of RSS was a centralized place to publish to all podcasting platforms; however, with this new subscription product, as well as other platforms, podcasters now have to publish in a variety of places and manage various backends — a particularly arduous task for small teams. One podcaster says they upload to Patreon, Apple, and their hosting provider right now, and they could end up also uploading to Spotify and other services, too. None of these separate feeds play nicely with each other, so the Patreon private RSS feed can’t be used to automatically upload paid content to Apple — every paid episode has to be uploaded manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwQDnc"&gt;“Apple is coming at it from the lens of a big corporation,” says a podcast manager of an independent show, who prefers to remain anonymous because of the sensitive nature of their relationship with Apple. “I think it’s harder for them to think about smaller independent shows that have so few people on staff. It’s such a foreign concept to them; they’re Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfQir8"&gt;This manager says they’ve spent days troubleshooting the platform, and at one point, waited a full night for an episode to process on the backend, at which point it was already dated content. On another recent evening, they say they uploaded their exclusive content to Patreon within five minutes, but then waited hours for it to process on Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dzDaVw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Small teams are publishing and managing various platforms with few people to help&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ECjCU"&gt;“That’s one of the consequences of us having a tiny team is like, it’s just me sitting around waiting for it to finish processing, so that I can publish the episode,” they say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xY0DYN"&gt;Bigger companies have a better chance of managing the subscription work uptick. They can hire producers to make bonus content, focus on multiple shows at once, and have the monetary resources to make a new project successful. NPR, for example — both an initial Apple subscriptions and Spotify subscriptions launch partner — hired two new people to handle the publishing of its six ad-free subscription shows, says Joel Sucherman, VP of new platform partnerships. They also help with quality checks, like making sure the subscriber feed content doesn’t accidentally have ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxqPT8"&gt;“The beauty of RSS was just publish it [and] it goes everywhere —  it’s just there, and it’s available,” Sucherman says. “And so these additional steps have introduced potential for user error or machine error and sometimes you play a little bit of whack-a-mole trying to figure out which is which, but I would characterize it as growing pains and things that will clearly get better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GRCrFj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bigger companies can afford to staff up to handle subscriptions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDtAhA"&gt;Apple’s main podcasting competitor, Spotify, has announced a solution to solve this labor problem in the form of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595013/spotify-open-access-podcasts-paid-access"&gt;Open Access technology&lt;/a&gt;. It says the technology will pair with existing subscription platforms, like Supporting Cast and Memberful, in order to make publishing in one place possible, even for premium content. However, both Apple and Patreon aren’t yet collaborating on the project, and Spotify is only making it available to invited partners right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMwkNo"&gt;“At the point that they do come up with a more automated solution for sending the files, that’ll be awesome,” says Tracy Leeds Kaplan, director of partnerships and operations at Tenderfoot TV, of Apple’s new system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fl1BSa"&gt;Even now, after the subscriptions launch, when one would hope the worst of the platform’s issues had subsided, podcasters say they’re still experiencing other technical glitches, namely, major delays in new episodes publishing. One executive, who prefers to remain anonymous, says one popular show, which is time-sensitive, experienced 72-hour publishing delays on multiple occasions. Another executive, who also prefers to remain anonymous, tells me their show listeners emailed them asking where the new episodes were, all because of Apple’s delay. (In a couple of these cases, the episodes in question weren’t even behind a paywall and relied on the typical RSS system.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1P0dY"&gt;“People get in their routine, and if an episode doesn’t come out when they expected, it’s really easy to move on to a new show,” one of these executives says. “We’ve had fans asking us what was up, and I think that’s a real bad look and really impactful on our numbers which translates to ad sales.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0ntCZ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Episode delays means possibly losing listeners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BxU01m"&gt;They also say the subscription product, at least for podcasters themselves, doesn’t feel complete and easy, especially compared to its competitors. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/6/10/15774936/apple-podcast-analytics-wwdc"&gt;In 2017&lt;/a&gt;, Apple began providing podcasters analytics about their show and episodes, like audience retention, for example, and one would presume those analytics would transfer over to the subscription product. Right now, though, podcasters say they have to download a txt.gz file, or spreadsheet, to view their subscription data. The indie podcast manager says they’re having trouble opening the file and still have no idea how many people are paying for their show, months after the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoJ6e0"&gt;“It’s frustrating because on Patreon, we can just go to a web browser interface and see our numbers — we can do that with anything,” they say. “It just seems overly complicated; why can’t you just put it on the internet?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q8zG0"&gt;One of the podcast executives, who has been able to open this file, still says the existence of a spreadsheet, rather than an accessible, legible backend interface is “not very Apple-like” and “just not really easy to use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Jvp01"&gt;This is also a case where bigger networks might have an advantage — their employees, or at least their hires, might be familiar with spreadsheets and pivot tables. Smaller companies, however, likely lack the resources and capabilities, meaning the gap between those who have big budgets and those who don’t widens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EaM05F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The downloaded spreadsheet has been hard for podcasters to parse &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7MxKh"&gt;Other, smaller concerns exist, too, like the fact that podcasters can’t view the number of “followers” a show has or people who follow the show but don’t pay for it. This number is critical for podcasters who want to monitor conversion, like whether they’re turning followers into paying listeners, and can serve as an indicator of a show’s success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xh280i"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCG9v0"&gt;Although Apple didn’t issue a response to these podcasters’ complaints, it’s easy to imagine the company saying that these folks aren’t forced to use the platform. Apple Podcasts has, and still does, support private RSS feeds, meaning people can publish on Patreon, Supporting Cast, or wherever else, and their listeners can enjoy the content within Apple’s world. But that choice comes at a cost: a lack of an in-app button. They’d miss out on the possible key to unlocking a new market of subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TOGMCG"&gt;But the platform’s ongoing problems, and its vocal critics, speak to the industry’s power dynamics. If Apple Podcasts doesn’t publish an episode for a day or two, a podcaster’s month could be ruined, both infuriating their paying subscribers and advertisers. Outsized influence in the industry means outsized scrutiny, and podcasters want answers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says collision in child-abuse hashing system is not a concern</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-tI3S8Iz7HFj9gBJrDYFCvUnyxc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741505/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r0Ff7C"&gt;Researchers have produced a collision in iOS’s built-in hash function, raising new concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;Apple’s CSAM-scanning system&lt;/a&gt; — but Apple says the finding does not threaten the integrity of the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5lOpn"&gt;The flaw affects the hashing algorithm, called NeuralHash, which allows Apple to check for exact matches of known child-abuse imagery without possessing any of the images or gleaning any information about non-matching pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiRbf8"&gt;On Tuesday, a GitHub user called Asuhariet Ygvar &lt;a href="https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX"&gt;posted code for&lt;/a&gt; a reconstructed Python version of NeuralHash, which he claimed to have reverse-engineered from previous versions of iOS. The GitHub post also includes &lt;a href="https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX/blob/master/README.md"&gt;instructions on how to extract the NeuralMatch files from a current macOS or iOS build&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting algorithm is a generic version of NeuralHash rather than the specific algorithm that will be used once the proposed CSAM system is deployed — but it still gives a general idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll8Eho"&gt;“Early tests show that it can tolerate image resizing and compression, but not cropping or rotations,” Ygvar wrote on Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/p6hsoh/p_appleneuralhash2onnx_reverseengineered_apple/"&gt;sharing the new code&lt;/a&gt;. “Hope this will help us understand NeuralHash algorithm better and know its potential issues before it’s enabled on all iOS devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ivT4by"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Researchers produced a collision: two images that generate the same hash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnJOzI"&gt;Shortly afterward, a user called Cory Cornelius &lt;a href="https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX/issues/1"&gt;produced a collision in the algorithm&lt;/a&gt;: two images that generate the same hash. It’s a significant finding, although Apple says additional protections in its CSAM system will prevent it from being exploited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVPGJu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;On August 5th&lt;/a&gt;, Apple introduced a new system for stopping child-abuse imagery on iOS devices. Under the new system, iOS will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;check locally stored files&lt;/a&gt; against hashes of child abuse imagery, as generated and maintained by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). The system contains numerous privacy safeguards, limiting scans to iCloud photos and setting a threshold of as many as 30 matches found before an alert is generated. Still, privacy advocates remain concerned about the implications of scanning local storage for illegal material, and the new finding has heightened concerns about how the system could be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGFVAU"&gt;In a call with reporters regarding the new findings, Apple said its CSAM-scanning system had been built with collisions in mind, given the known limitations of perceptual hashing algorithms. In particular, the company emphasized a secondary server-side hashing algorithm, separate from NeuralHash, the specifics of which are not public. If an image that produced a NeuralHash collision were flagged by the system, it would be checked against the secondary system and identified as an error before reaching human moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGnChB"&gt;Even without that additional check, it would require extraordinary efforts to exploit the collision in practice. Generally, collision attacks allow researchers to find identical inputs that produce the same hash. In Apple’s system, this would mean generating an image that sets off the CSAM alerts even though it is not a CSAM image, since it produces the same hash as an image in the database. But actually generating that alert would require access to the NCMEC hash database, generating more than 30 colliding images, and then smuggling all of them onto the target’s phone. Even then, it would only generate an alert to Apple and NCMEC, which would easily identify the images as false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2R87I"&gt;A proof-of-concept collision is often disastrous for crytographic hashes, as in the case of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/23/14712118/google-sha1-collision-broken-web-encryption-shattered"&gt;the SHA-1 collision in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but perceptual hashes like NeuralHash are known to be more collision-prone. And while Apple expects to make changes from the generic NeuralMatch algorithm currently present in iOS, the broad system is likely to remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XNcpf"&gt;Still, the finding will is unlikely to quiet calls for Apple to abandon its plans for on-device scans, which have continued to escalate in the weeks following the announcement. On Tuesday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation &lt;a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-apple-don-t-scan-our-phones"&gt;launched a petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on Apple to drop the system, under the title “Tell Apple: Don’t Scan Our Phones.” As of press time, it has garnered more than 1,700 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSftcK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10:53AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changed headline and copy to more accurately reflect known weaknesses of perceptual hash systems in general.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtkJIF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added significant details throughout after receiving further information from Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ZU538"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, the five-versus-five MOBA game that released in July for the Nintendo Switch, will debut on iOS and Android devices on September 22nd. The Pokémon Company shared today during a livestream that you can pre-register for the mobile game now on your respective devices (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1512321575"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;). You’ll be notified when it’s officially available to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJqIX3"&gt;Whether you play &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; on mobile or a Nintendo Switch, the game will offer cross-platform play to broaden who you can play alongside or against. By linking your account on both the Switch version and the mobile game, you’ll be able to have cross-progression, which will allow you to play the game with your saved data and characters on whichever device is more convenient. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS 15 beta fixes the Safari address bar and lets you move it back to the top</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQiZaXf28tT68EDKnF3rm01iCgY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738014/acastro_200207_3900_Safari_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tq7nN6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes"&gt;Apple has updated Safari’s design&lt;/a&gt; in the latest iOS 15 beta (Developer Beta 6), making the address bar look and act more like what users are used to and giving you the option to put it at either the top or bottom of the screen. Safari’s redesign, especially on iPhones, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577475/apple-safari-macos-monterey-ios-15-developer-beta-3-change-design"&gt;been controversial&lt;/a&gt; since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like Apple is starting to walk back the floating design that’s persisted throughout the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj0QLp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt; founder and podcaster Federico Viticci has posted screenshots of the new design on Twitter, showing off the changes. If the user chooses to have the address bar on the bottom, it sits above a row of controls, including back and forward buttons, a share button, and the tab button. (In previous versions of the beta, these buttons were one with the address bar.) If the user chooses the option to have the address bar at the top, Safari will look similar to how it did in iOS 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9wNWNe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We did it everyone:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safari in iOS 15 beta 6 features a new address bar at the bottom that sits below page content. A toolbar with buttons is back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And we can put the address bar back at the top again   &lt;a href="https://t.co/dbCvauXoDy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dbCvauXoDy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1427683610031702017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzlfWB214q6IXC-JQKxypW0vLhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788122/IMG_2284.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For comparison, this is Safari’s UI in the previous beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DMjLV0"&gt;Apple has been tweaking and changing Safari’s new design since it made its debut in the first beta. The updates have been relatively small — buttons were added back into the address bar (making it a minefield of touch targets), and Apple &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/qtUKzWab71Q?t=256"&gt;made the address bar easier to get to when you’re typing in a URL or search term&lt;/a&gt;. However, the incremental updates haven’t appeased those calling for a return to a more traditional design, one that doesn’t include a floating element that hovers above a webpage’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2SaYo3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Options should help please those who (kind of) liked the change, and those who didn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cRKvPp"&gt;The option to change where the address bar resides should please those who thought its new place at the bottom was a good one (regardless of how its actual design was executed), as well as those who prefer to have it at the top. It may make things tough for web designers, who will have to deal with the possibility of something butting up against either the top or bottom of their webpage, but it’s a nice option for users to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCHIpb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1427685686849769472?s=20"&gt;According to Viticci&lt;/a&gt;, the iPad version of Safari hasn’t changed with this update, though Apple introduced an option that more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596478/apple-ios-15-beta-safari-tabs-compact-optional"&gt;let you go back to a traditional design&lt;/a&gt; in Beta 4.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says SharePlay won’t be part of initial iOS 15 release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV1QOYraAdCGnrD9LKF3x-VKrc=/13x0:2032x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737506/D3743FFE_9B62_4074_ADC3_50C2232BB74A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCkPhu"&gt;One of iOS 15’s marquee new features, SharePlay, has been delayed and now won’t be rolled out until after the major update is released this fall. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/"&gt;Apple has informed developers&lt;/a&gt; that SharePlay will be disabled in the next betas of iOS 15, iPadOS15, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey. SharePlay allows people to enjoy entertainment (TV shows, movies, music, etc.) together at the same time and syncs everything up across devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlzp23"&gt;The company has confirmed that this feature will be absent in the official release of iOS 15 when it widely rolls out in the fall. Apple now says that SharePlay will return “in future developer beta releases and will launch to the public in software updates later this fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xOg5i"&gt;“We’re thrilled with the high level of enthusiasm we’ve seen from the developer community for SharePlay, and we can’t wait to bring it to users so that they can experience your apps with their friends and family in a whole new way,” Apple said in its update to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4G10w"&gt;This is the first major new aspect of iOS 15 to be pulled back from the launch release, but it will undoubtedly raise questions about which other features might also have to wait for a later update. Apple has yet to include Universal Control, one of the most impressive tricks it showed off at WWDC, in any of this summer’s beta releases. Universal Control will allow iPad and Mac owners to work seamlessly across both products with the same keyboard and mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaLdpC"&gt;Apple has held back some of its promised features from previous major iOS releases until they were more polished and ready to go. As just one example, Group FaceTime was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17684154/apple-group-facetime-chats-delay-ios-12"&gt;delayed from the initial release of iOS 12&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 until a smaller update that rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18040034/apple-ios-12-1-release-date-october-30-features-group-facetime-beautygate"&gt;at the end of October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUAdXX"&gt;Check out our preview of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; for a rundown of all the new features that Apple says will be available — at some point, anyway — later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
