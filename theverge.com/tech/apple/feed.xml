    <title>A short history of every time Apple CEO Tim Cook praised augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BFSuuOJCdScY2AnKMm3g_j2QVS4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69848232/tim-cook-apple-stock-0563.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cook has been singing the praises of AR for five years&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ERzUQ0"&gt;Tim Cook has just marked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;10 years as Apple’s CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and while he’s grown Apple into the most valuable company in the world, it’s reasonable to argue he hasn’t yet introduced a signature, industry shaking product like Apple co-founder Steve Jobs did with the iPhone, iPad, Mac and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqO7Qo"&gt;But if you’ve been following Apple for a minute, you’ve probably heard Cook talk about the game-changing potential of augmented reality. While he once said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/28/4374482/tim-cook-apple-wearable-google-glass"&gt;hard to see the appeal of Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;, the AR wearable that proved unpopular with consumers, he’s held a consistently positive opinion on AR since at least 2016. While most of the industry was putting all its eggs in the VR basket, Cook repeatedly expressed support for what he views as the far superior AR. This would become a running theme: AR good, VR not so good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3j429"&gt;It seems likely that AR may become the hallmark of Cook’s tenure, as long as Apple executes on a winning idea. While that’s not exactly guaranteed — Apple has yet to unveil an AR headset or glasses — Cook’s frequent comments about the tech keep the topic in the news and reassure investors and customers that Apple is working on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZIIDx"&gt;AR features are already available on the iPhone and iPad. And while hope is starting to fade that Apple will release a mixed reality device in 2022, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;latest rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; the company is still forging ahead with some kind of AR/VR headset to be released in the not-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jIE1"&gt;Here’s a brief history of all the times Tim Cook said he was convinced AR was the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LR10VY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook says in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/26/12290920/apple-augmented-reality-ar-tim-cook"&gt;quarterly earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that “AR can be really great.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX7rQO"&gt;“We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run, we think there’s great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. The number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers’ kind of products like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, that’s why you see so many iPhones in the wild chasing pokemons.” (Cook pronounces it “pokey-mans.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3BaXv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-prefers-augmented-reality/story?id=42064913"&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview that he believes AR is a bigger deal than VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtE9kB"&gt;“There’s virtual reality and there’s augmented reality — both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEwdho"&gt;AR “gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things — visually — for both of us to see. Maybe it’s something we’re talking about, maybe it’s someone else here who’s not here present but who can be made to appear to be present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WB8GUn"&gt;“There’s a lot of really cool things there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqvA1V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook makes a brief mention of AR in a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2016/08/13/tim-cook-the-interview-running-apple-is-sort-of-a-lonely-job/?utm_term=.71cfafb58188"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt;: “I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfFqeu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;In an appearance at Utah Tech Tour, Cook goes into detail about &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/02/tim-cook-talks-steve-jobs-need-for-encryption-at-utah-tech-tour-video/"&gt;how crucial AR may become&lt;/a&gt; and why he views it as superior to VR — while stressing that AR presents significant technology challenges before it can be adopted for mass consumerism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="s4U9pW"&gt;In terms of it becoming a mass adoption [phenomenon], so that, say, everyone in here would have an AR experience, the reality to do that, it has to be something that everyone in here views to be an “acceptable thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE5O2T"&gt;And nobody in here, few people in here, think it’s acceptable to be tethered to a computer walking in here and sitting down, few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something, because we’re all social people at heart. Even introverts are social people, we like people and we want to interact. It has to be that it’s likely that AR, of the two, is the one the largest number of people will engage with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyxSDF"&gt;I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you, a lot of us live on our smartphones, the iPhone, I hope, is very important for everyone, so AR will become really big. VR I think is not going to be that big, compared to AR. I’m not saying it’s not important, it is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mfq3v"&gt;I’m excited about VR from an education point of view, I think it can be really big for education, I think it can be very big for games. But I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me. But I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now, if the technology was there, which it’s not today. How long will it take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wx2VTE"&gt;AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there. But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="o5nJLd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkV78RZ73Mw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6ivZT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-virtual-reality-theres-no-substitute-f#.qel1aEjdb"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while “VR has some interesting applications,” AR is superior to VR because “there’s no substitute for human contact. And so you want the technology to encourage that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LWV7WX"&gt;Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might ... have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. ... You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8zwWMG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2017: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-tim-cook-boss-brexit-uk-theresa-may-number-10-interview-ustwo-a7574086.html"&gt;expands his thoughts on AR’s potential&lt;/a&gt;, adding a new comparison: AR is a big idea, like the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qlZDkX"&gt;I’m excited about augmented reality because unlike virtual reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what’s happening presently. Most people don’t want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can’t do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHlQnM"&gt;I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that’s why I get so excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ywuu2K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-15/apple-s-tim-cook-on-donald-trump-the-homepod-and-the-legacy-of-steve-jobs"&gt;wide-ranging interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook details his vision for AR at Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b2MVpL"&gt;I think it is profound. I am so excited about it, I just want to yell out and scream. The first step in making it a mainstream kind of experience is to put it in the operating system. We’re building it into iOS 11, opening it to ­developers—and unleashing the creativity of millions of people. Even we can’t predict what’s going to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5fDe2"&gt;There’s some things that you can already get a vision of. We’ve talked to IKEA, and they have 3D images of their furniture line. You’re talking about changing the whole experience of how you shop for, in this case, furniture and other objects that you can place around the home. You can take that idea and begin to think this is something that stretches from enterprise to consumer. There’s not a lot of things that do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hboXPl"&gt;You’ll see things happening in enterprises where AR is ­fundamental to what they’re doing. You’re going to see some consumer things that are unbelievably cool. Can we do everything we want to do now? No. The technology’s not complete yet. But that’s the beauty to a certain degree. This has a runway. And it’s an incredible runway. It’s time to put the seat belt on and go. When people begin to see what’s possible, it’s going to get them very excited—like we are, like we’ve been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DIea6k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; At an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590323"&gt;event at Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, Cook responds to a student who asks what technology he would consider “transformative.” Cook says there are widespread uses for AR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYUKHM"&gt;“I’m incredibly excited by AR because I can see uses for it everywhere. I can see uses for it in education, in consumers, in entertainment, in sports. I can see it in every business that I know anything about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JpVYm"&gt;“I also like the fact that it doesn’t isolate. I don’t like our products being used a lot. I like our products amplifying thoughts and I think AR can help amplify the human connection. I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite. There are clearly some cool niche things for VR but it’s not profound in my view. AR is profound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJlluP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In an &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-future-of-fashion-augmented-reality"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vogue UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says while Apple wasn’t looking to build a “giant database of clothes,” it would support companies in the AR space who were doing this work. “If you think about a runway show in the fashion world, that’s a great application of AR because some of these, you want to see the dress all the way around, you do not want to just see the front,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, noting how many runway shows are live-streamed and not just visible to an in-person audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBEvu6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;introduction of its ARKit platform on iOS 11&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says in a quarterly earnings call that &lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/the-transcript-of-todays-opening-statement-from-apples-ceo-on-fiscal-q4-2017-is-now-available.html"&gt;Apple has created&lt;/a&gt; the world’s largest augmented reality platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GdJYqz"&gt;There already are over a thousand apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of app aimed at consumers, students and business users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RV7Y54"&gt;Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever. We’re already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine from the human body to the solar system. And of course you experience them like you’re really there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je9Rb6"&gt;Instantly education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase – or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to change everything&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DM0tys"&gt;This is not quite what came to pass (more on that later). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJAyaa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-ARKit launch, Cook admits he &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-iphone-tim-cook-interview-features-new-augmented-reality-ar-arkit-a7993566.html"&gt;thinks AR technology&lt;/a&gt; for headsets or glasses isn’t yet up to par as far as Apple is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag0KHY"&gt;“I can tell you the technology itself doesn’t exist to do that in a quality way. The display technology required, as well as putting enough stuff around your face — there’s huge challenges with that. The field of view, the quality of the display itself, it’s not there yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMoVt4"&gt;“We don’t give a rat’s about being first, we want to be the best, and give people a great experience. But now anything you would see on the market any time soon would not be something any of us would be satisfied with. Nor do I think the vast majority of people would be satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvKmAY"&gt;“Most technology challenges can be solved, but it’s a matter of how long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiQf8M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/02/01/apple-inc-appl-q1-2018-earnings-conference-call-tr.aspx"&gt;Apple’s Q1 earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Cook describes “great excitement” around augmented reality among customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5QNWq"&gt;“Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices, and with ARKit, we’re giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yOGiC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;NowThisNews&lt;/em&gt; during an interview about Apple’s Watch that AR is poised to become indispensable. “I think that one day we will wonder how we ever lived without it,” Cook says of AR. “We can have a much more enhanced conversation with the power of AR.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZOOfV"&gt;“The future is now,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EZs5TM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vX9xBB_vBsc?rel=0&amp;amp;start=433" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VO88JU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2020: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/tim-cook-ar-war-ducks-healthtech"&gt;Cook tells an audience in Dublin, Ireland&lt;/a&gt; that augmented reality “is the next big thing” and that it will “pervade our entire lives.” He gives an example of a company using AR and described its potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImgYq0"&gt;Yesterday, I visited a development company called War Ducks … in Dublin – 15 people and they’re staffing up and using AR for games. You can imagine, for games it’s incredible but even for our discussion here. You and I might be talking about an article and using AR we can pull it up, and can both be looking at the same thing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDw6RA"&gt;I think it’s something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5lTJJO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2021&lt;/strong&gt;: During an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;interview with journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; Cook agreed with her that augmented reality is “a critically important part of Apple’s future.” He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NExGsI"&gt;What’s Apple plan for AR?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MZhJMH"&gt;Clearly, Tim Cook has been bullish on AR for a long time. But so far, Apple’s biggest foray into AR remains the 2017 launch of ARKit — which use iPhones’ and iPads’ cameras and sensors to overlay images in 3D space when the device is pointed at a given area — for iOS 11. ARKit is available across Apple’s devices, which meant a lot of &lt;a href="https://github.com/olucurious/Awesome-ARKit"&gt;cool little projects&lt;/a&gt; by amateur AR enthusiasts. When ARKit launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the tech had the potential to allow Apple to catch rival Google in the AR space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv9YB6"&gt;But despite the interesting early projects, ARKit hype fizzled after a few months. It’s not totally clear why, because it was released at the height of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; craze when AR finally had a popular mass-market application for a devoted fan base. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;itself is still wildly profitable&lt;/a&gt;, raking in a billion dollars a year on average, but we haven’t seen a larger movement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikGTfK"&gt;Since ARKit, Apple has made other, smaller steps forward with AR apps for the iPhone. In May 2019, it introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/14/statue-of-liberty-ar-ios-app/"&gt;Statue of Liberty AR app&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1128412203932049408"&gt;Cook tweeting&lt;/a&gt;, “The Statue of Liberty app is just the beginning of how AR will transform the way we connect with our world’s treasures.” In July 2019, it introduced augmented reality art sessions for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh9exC"&gt;In addition to Tim Cook’s constant cheerleading of the technology, there are other signs that Apple is moving toward an AR future. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natbro/status/1155849145350909954"&gt;hiring of people like Nat Brown&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Microsoft; listing &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/01/apple-lists-ar-vr-jobs-reportedly-taps-executive-who-finalizes-products/"&gt;dozens of AR and VR job postings&lt;/a&gt;; acquisitions including &lt;a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/28/apple-buys-german-augmented-reality-firm-metaio/"&gt;Metaio in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15877520/apple-sensomotoric-instruments-acquisition-ar-vr-eye-tracking"&gt;SensoMotoric in 2017&lt;/a&gt;; and patents on things like “&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=09383582&amp;amp;SectionNum=1&amp;amp;IDKey=4E2221DF6AD9&amp;amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=9,383,582.PN.%2526OS=PN/9,383,582%2526RS=PN/9,383,582"&gt;head mounted display&lt;/a&gt;” devices all demonstrate its steady progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WuEKr7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s AR hardware is perennially two years away&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbknTJ"&gt;Reports started &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-augmented-reality-vr-virtual-reality-headset-powered-by-a-wireless-wigig-hub/"&gt;trickling out in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had a timeline to launch both an AR headset and AR glasses. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses"&gt;The company had 1,000 engineers&lt;/a&gt; working on its VR and AR initiative — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-04/apple-augmented-reality-headset-executive-leaves-company"&gt;codenamed “T288”&lt;/a&gt; — which were expected to include a combined VR and AR headset to be released in 2021 or 2022, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, with a pair of sleeker AR glasses predicted to launch in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqsIdJ"&gt;The latest reporting from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-ar-vr-headset-will-need-connection-to-other-device-such-as-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;however, indicates that an Apple AR/VR headset may need to rely on the processor of another connected device like an iPhone (similar to the early Apple Watch models), and that Apple is working on a custom chip for the helmet-like headset that might take at least another year to arrive. Some aren’t as bullish on the more glasses-like variant either; &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; suggests Apple could still release that in 2023, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks&lt;/a&gt; a 2025 release is more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2d0mj"&gt;It shouldn’t be all that surprising that Apple has taken its time making AR hardware; it is, after all, the company that introduced the AirPower wireless charging pad, showed it off to the world, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;canceled the product because it wasn’t up to company standards&lt;/a&gt; — and that was just an charging accessory, not a potentially new computing paradigm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrJyTD"&gt;So it’s to be expected that Apple would take its time on an AR or VR headset. After hyping the potential for AR all this time, Cook surely doesn’t want Apple to repeat the failure of Google Glass by launching iGlasses too soon, and definitely not before the technology meets Apple’s very high bar.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A comprehensive breakdown of the Epic v. Apple ruling</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Whoever lost, we win&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tZUq6R"&gt;On Friday, a California judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ruled on the influential &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling"&gt;both sides lost&lt;/a&gt;. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers concluded that Apple wasn’t unfairly monopolizing the mobile app space with iOS or its in-app purchasing system, and she &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.814.0_2.pdf"&gt;ordered Epic to pay&lt;/a&gt; damages for violating its developer agreement with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. At the same time, she &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.813.0_3.pdf"&gt;ordered Apple to remove&lt;/a&gt; its anti-steering rules — policies banning developers from telling users about alternatives to Apple’s in-app purchase system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="UhUeEU"&gt;For readers outside those two companies, though, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.812.0_3.pdf"&gt;Judge Rogers’ opinion&lt;/a&gt; has a lot to offer. Rogers clearly considers much of Epic and Apple’s behavior silly and many of both companies’ arguments bad. But she seriously examines all these arguments and lays out a blueprint for further legal arguments about mobile platforms, app monopolies, and modern antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="cgUMNJ"&gt;So we’re going to take a close look into the ruling’s biggest conclusions — and what they mean for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WozvDh"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="482" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP3856497645&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1332xI"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; suit is about mobile game payments, not iOS apps or the bigger game market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="f0NWG6"&gt;During the trial, both sides argued over which market &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; iOS app belonged to. Epic claimed Apple had abused a monopoly on the iOS app ecosystem; Apple claimed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was playing in the more competitive overall digital game market. (This is why the trial’s lawyers kept asking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;whether &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a game&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hUYi2"&gt;Judge Rogers says both these definitions are wrong, although Apple’s is somewhat less wrong. Instead, the question is whether Apple has an unlawful monopoly in “digital mobile gaming transactions.” Rogers notes that mobile games often have a different user base than PC or console games, and they rely hugely on the “freemium” model of in-game item sales, which are less important to both mobile apps and console or PC games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtzwYy"&gt;Epic made 10 claims against Apple. Most of them depended significantly on Apple having an unfair monopoly under either the federal Sherman Antitrust Act or California’s antitrust-focused Cartwright Act. And although the ruling is sympathetic toward several of Epic’s underlying arguments, nearly all its claims were dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J68sDL"&gt;Apple doesn’t have a monopoly in mobile gaming — yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5wV9nV"&gt;Mobile games are a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; part of Apple’s App Store revenue — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;approximately 70 percent&lt;/a&gt;, according to the ruling — and Apple has outsized power in mobile gaming. Rogers concludes iOS and Android hold a near-duopoly, although she considers the Nintendo Switch and cloud gaming services potential near-future competitors. The ruling estimates that Apple has a share of around 55 percent in the mobile game transactions market, alongside “extraordinarily high profit margins,” which can be a sign of monopoly power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pdl6sN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Success is not illegal”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RrGKLl"&gt;But despite Apple’s “considerable” power and profit margins, “these factors alone do not show antitrust conduct. Success is not illegal,” Rogers concludes. While Epic argued that iMessage and other factors deliberately lock users into iOS, Rogers wasn’t convinced by this line of reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMPX5K"&gt;The ruling leaves the door open for future antitrust complaints. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power, or monopoly power, with its considerable market share,” Rogers writes. “Apple is only saved by the fact that its share is not higher, that competitors from related submarkets are making inroads into the mobile gaming submarket, and, perhaps, because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSh0zM"&gt;For now, though, this judgment undercut Epic’s allegation that Apple maintained a monopoly or unlawfully restrained trade under the Sherman Act, helping taking down four of its claims against Apple. The ruling says that by extension, it means Apple didn’t violate California’s Cartwright Act, taking down two more of the claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9TwG9"&gt;A seventh claim said iOS was an “essential facility” that Apple had unfairly denied access to. But Epic didn’t seriously argue this claim, and for mobile app developers, Rogers says web apps and other digital platforms provide a reasonable (if not ideal) distribution alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jxi0sJ"&gt;The App Store has a troubling lack of competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EE2yh1"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ruling has some harsh words for the App Store. At one point, Rogers notes that “nothing other than legal action seems to motivate Apple to reconsider pricing and reduce rates.” At other points, she says Apple “does a poor job of mediating disputes between a developer and its customer,” and it’s been “slow either to adopt automated tools that could improve speed and accuracy or to hire more reviewers” for its app review process. “Apple’s slow innovation stems in part from its low investment in the App Store,” the ruling elaborates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2QuZ5"&gt;Meanwhile, although Rogers takes a dim view of Epic’s economic analysis, she accepts that “Apple’s operating margins tied to the App Store are extraordinarily high.” And she specifically calls out a lack of competition as an issue. “The point is not that ... Apple provides bad services. It does not,” she writes. “The point is that a third-party app store could put pressure on Apple to innovate by providing features that Apple has neglected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6bCBIN"&gt;Apple has valid security fears about opening up iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIXRgv"&gt;Apple’s trial witnesses promoted iOS as an unusually safe and secure ecosystem because of its walled-garden model, saying no other option would be appropriate for the sensitive data on people’s phones. Epic called that claim a pretext for shutting down competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiHVZW"&gt;The ruling deflates some of Apple’s protestations. Judge Rogers is particularly dubious of Apple software engineering VP Craig Federighi, who delivered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667256/apple-vs-epic-trail-judge-craig-federighi-macos-security-arguments-iphone-ios-response"&gt;dramatic but suspiciously new denunciation&lt;/a&gt; of macOS malware. She’s generally receptive to Epic’s suggestion that Apple could review and notarize iOS apps for security but allow distribution through other sources, similar to macOS. “Even though unrestricted app distribution likely decreases security, alternative models are readily achievable to attain the same ends even if not currently employed,” she concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJbOvQ"&gt;Rogers doesn’t think that makes Apple’s claims pretextual, though. She agrees with Apple that comprehensive human review — which isn’t part of macOS notarization — can offer a “safe and trusted user experience” that’s actually pro-consumer. By contrast, she says Epic’s proposed solutions “principally appear to eliminate app review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SesPrv"&gt;The ruling dashes Epic’s hope that Apple would legally have to allow sideloaded apps and third-party app stores on iOS — which was Apple’s worst-case scenario going into the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ypc4OO"&gt;Apple has a right to require its in-app payment options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QA0G2F"&gt;As you might remember if you’ve been following &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, this whole dispute started with in-app purchase (or IAP) payment processing. Epic tweaked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on iOS so that players could buy in-game V-Bucks via two methods: the Apple App Store or an “Epic direct payment” with a 20 percent discount.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Epic’s “Direct Pay” option on Fortnite for iOS" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3eqtNf3_1u_dHbT4SK8io5ZnyvM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22842905/epic_direct_pay_apple_app_store_2045x979_730033169.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Epic’s “Direct Pay” option on Fortnite for iOS, August 2020&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AAQide"&gt;Epic described Apple’s IAP system as a glorified payment processor with outsized fees, and it argued that Apple was illegally tying IAP to the overall App Store. In Epic’s view, developers should be able to offer multiple payment processing options or reject Apple’s payment system altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEQffk"&gt;This is a big point of dissatisfaction among major app developers, and Friday’s ruling isn’t terribly promising for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jACtu"&gt;Rogers is skeptical of some Apple arguments for its current locked-down system and the attendant 30 percent — for big companies like Epic — commission. (Dunking on both sides’ expert witness analysis is a running theme in her ruling.) She also notes there’s “no evidence that IAP provides developers with any unique features” compared to standard payment processing. But she’s fairly straightforwardly opposed to making Apple unbundle the system, calling Epic’s request for it “deficient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpZxdf"&gt;Throughout the trial, Apple has said that it’s not simply charging for payment processing on IAP. It’s using it to collect a commission — the 15 or 30 percent so-called “Apple Tax” — on the larger value of the App Store. Epic disputed that Apple meaningfully earned that commission, saying that although the App Store connects (in its words, “matches”) users with developers, Apple doesn’t deserve a cut of every transaction that happens after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sjKF7R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Epic argued over how much the in-app purchase system actually benefits developers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qhhmZ0"&gt;The ruling says the matching description is “partially true,” but that Apple has “never argued that it levies a commission merely because it matches the developers with the customers.” Instead, “IAP is the method by which Apple collects its licensing fee from developers for the use of Apple’s intellectual property.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28REhZ"&gt;Rogers admittedly finds “no basis” for the specific 30 percent rate, despite Apple hiring a consultant to testify about the value of its patents. (As mentioned previously, the ruling is &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; of dunks on the expert witnesses.) But she says Apple is still entitled to license that intellectual property for a fee of some sort, and requiring developers to use Apple’s payment system “accomplishes this goal in the easiest and most direct manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty0mzd"&gt;Epic’s unbundling alternative, meanwhile, would “severely undermine” the system, says the ruling. “Indeed, to the extent Epic Games suggests that Apple receive nothing from in-app purchases made on its platform, such a remedy is inconsistent with prevailing intellectual property law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXFczv"&gt;Rogers’ conclusion is another reason Epic didn’t prevail on the monopoly maintenance or restraint of trade claims discussed above, since two of them specifically dealt with IAP. She also says IAP isn’t a standalone product, so Apple isn’t illegally tying it to the App Store, which nixes two more Sherman and Cartwright Act claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F17md"&gt;For those keeping score, that’s nine claims down for Epic. But there’s one final claim that makes this ruling a significant thorn in Apple’s side. Let’s talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Drmlt4"&gt;iOS developers have a right to talk about alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2LfpMU"&gt;Rogers concludes that Apple doesn’t monopolize mobile gaming. But the company &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; violate California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL) through its anti-steering rules: policies that restrict developers from telling users they can buy digital goods outside Apple’s ecosystem. The ruling focuses on this portion of Apple’s developer agreement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="teWznP"&gt;“Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9HEtdf"&gt;Rogers has almost unreserved scorn for this policy. “By employing anti-steering provisions, consumers do not know what developers may be offering on their websites, including lower prices,” she writes. Developers are allowed to email customers to advertise, but only through addresses they’ve collected outside the iOS signup process, which consumers also don’t necessarily know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HVpQx"&gt;Users don’t necessarily even know about the cut Apple is taking — that “if they subscribe to their favorite newspaper on the web,” for instance, “all the proceeds go to the newspaper, rather than the reduced amount by subscribing on the iOS device.” Some people appreciate that Apple offers a unified place to manage subscriptions. But others might not, and “Apple actively denies them the choice” to find alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E34gtC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple created a new and innovative platform which was also a black box”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fhcWQH"&gt;“Apple created a new and innovative platform which was also a black box. It enforced silence to control information and actively impede users from obtaining the knowledge to obtain digital goods on other platforms,” Rogers concludes. “Apple has used this lack of knowledge to exploit its position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zi337e"&gt;The ruling says Apple’s situation is “distinctly different” from another case that let American Express use anti-steering rules for brick-and-mortar merchants, because even in that scenario, merchants can still say they also accept Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWLp8B"&gt;Accordingly, a new injunction will soon prevent Apple from banning “buttons, external links, or other calls to action” that direct users to other payment mechanisms. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;potentially a big deal for Apple&lt;/a&gt;... although it’s not yet clear just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; big a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WDuR25"&gt;Apple could collect an ‘Apple Tax’ even without in-app payment charges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o2ZXJn"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;my colleague Nilay Patel discusses&lt;/a&gt;, Judge Rogers’ injunction leaves some weird ambiguity about what developers can do. In theory, a developer could add a button that directs users to Safari or another app for payment, but looks indistinguishable from the option to pay with Apple’s system. (It’s worth noting the injunction &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; say Apple has to let developers build complete alternate payment methods into their apps, and based on the statements quoted earlier, Rogers seems fairly down on that prospect.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQsMYF"&gt;But developers like Epic don’t just care about controlling payment methods out of principle — although it offers some unique benefits like getting to handle refunds. They care about ditching Apple’s 30 percent commission. And Rogers says bluntly that it’s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9kscF"&gt;Even if developers could entirely stop using the IAP system, “Apple could still charge a commission on developers. It would simply be more difficult for Apple to collect that commission,” Rogers writes. The ruling elaborates on this scenario — in which Apple is outright banned from making developers use its payment option — in a footnote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XuuLne"&gt;“In such a hypothetical world, developers could potentially avoid the commission while benefitting from Apple’s innovation and intellectual property free of charge. The Court presumes that in such circumstances that Apple may rely on imposing and utilizing a contractual right to audit developers annual accounting to ensure compliance with its commissions, among other methods. Of course, any alternatives to IAP (including the foregoing) would seemingly impose both increased monetary and time costs to both Apple and the developers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TXWvCV"&gt;The law now says that Apple can’t stop developers from offering cheaper prices outside their iOS apps and telling users about it. But if big developers successfully route a lot of money away from the App Store this way, Rogers seemingly leaves the door open to collecting the “Apple Tax” some other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LidZbJ"&gt;Epic and Apple’s contract was valid, and Epic knowingly broke it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a0bs43"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ruling declares that part of Apple’s developer agreement (called the DPLA) is unlawful... but Epic still has to pay for breaking it with the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; payment system change. By the same token, Apple doesn’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667069/fortnite-ios-return-apple-epic-ruling"&gt;restore &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or keep Epic’s other apps on iOS if it doesn’t agree to follow Apple’s rules. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuAAIW"&gt;The first reason is basically that Apple’s agreement didn’t break the law &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;. Epic claimed the contract was “illegal and unenforceable” because it violated the Sherman Act, the Cartwright Act, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the UCL. Rogers concludes that the single UCL offense wasn’t sufficiently related or severe to justify Epic’s rulebreaking. She also dismisses the claim that Apple’s contract was “unconscionable” — in other words, one-sided enough to “shock the conscience.” (“These are billion and trillion dollar companies with a business dispute,” the ruling notes dryly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXqm5t"&gt;The second reason is that Epic broke another rule in the process. It hid the alternate payment system inside a remote “hotfix” when Apple’s policies said it couldn’t “provide, unlock, or enable additional features or functionality through distribution mechanisms other than the App Store.” That specific provision wasn’t related to antitrust claims, and the ruling concludes Epic “never showed why it had to breach its agreements” to challenge Apple’s alleged anti-competitive actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CzJay8"&gt;We still don’t know what a game is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ahoIyG"&gt;Sure, all the questions above are &lt;em&gt;legally relevant&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;important for consumers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;set a detailed precedent for future antitrust legislation and lawsuits&lt;/em&gt;. But let’s end with the fun part: after all the time witnesses spent arguing about what a video game is, does the ruling give us a definition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYo3N1"&gt;The short answer is no, because it doesn’t have to. “The court need not reach a conclusive definition of a video game or game because by all accounts, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; itself is both externally and internally considered a video game.” &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; markets itself as a game, and even if CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;considers it the basis for a larger metaverse&lt;/a&gt; (in case you were wondering, “the court generally finds Mr. Sweeney’s personal beliefs about the future of the metaverse are sincerely held”), the metaverse as a product “remains in its infancy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdPQ4P"&gt;As for the definitions introduced by witnesses, “unfortunately, no one agrees and neither side introduced evidence of any commonly accepted industry definition.” That includes Sweeney’s claim that a game “involves some sort of win or loss or a score progression,” as well as Apple app review head Trystan Kosmynka’s claim that “games have a beginning, [and] an end,” and “there’s challenges in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jX5BQC"&gt;Rogers does, however, spend a surprising amount of time breaking down the core elements of a video game. Here’s a brief definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WlDnB1"&gt;“The court concludes that video games include a diverse and eclectic genre of games, that are tied together at minimum through varying degrees of interactivity and involvement from a game player.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JZEU5f"&gt;There’s also a more elaborate one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6OmG0k"&gt;“At a bare minimum, video games appear to require some level of interactivity or involvement between the player and the medium. In other words, a game requires that a player be able to input some level of a command or choice which is then reflected in the game itself. This gaming definition contrasts to other forms of entertainment, which are often passive forms enjoyed by consumers (e.g., films, television, music). Video games are also generally graphically rendered or animated, as opposed to being recorded live or via motion capture as in films and television.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eidJop"&gt;You could certainly quibble with elements of this, and Rogers admits she’s not clarifying the “outer boundaries of the definition of video games.” She declines to say whether specific non-Epic titles, like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;, are games. She also says she can’t conclude whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;certain games on the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://Itch.io"&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt; storefront&lt;/a&gt; were sexually explicit or problematic, given that “the corresponding materials ... were not submitted to the court” — although she does offer a ruling on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666922/apple-epic-peely-naked-banana-judgement"&gt;naked banana man decorum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Ff4CL1"&gt;Ultimately, “the court leaves the thornier further questions of what is properly included and excluded in the definition of a video game to the academics and commentators,” Rogers determines. And fortunately plenty of both seem ready to take up the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorcycle vibrations can degrade iPhone camera performance, Apple says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fcXBzDn9Z-qcK5MgoivX8atXJq4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844108/akrales_201018_4238_0293.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple says its iPhone cameras may be damaged by motorcycle vibrations | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hTpRpF"&gt;A new post on &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212803"&gt;Apple’s Support forum&lt;/a&gt; says exposing iPhones to high-amplitude vibrations, “specifically those generated by high-power motorcycle engines” could degrade the devices’ camera system. The company recommends against mounting an iPhone on a motorcycle, as the vibrations may be transmitted via the bike’s handlebars and chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sRwLO"&gt;Here’s the technical explanation from Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QRkuKC"&gt;If you accidentally move a camera when you take a picture, the resulting image can be blurry. To prevent this, some iPhone models have optical image stabilization (OIS).1 OIS lets you take sharp photos even if you accidentally move the camera. With OIS, a gyroscope senses that the camera moved. To reduce image motion, and the resulting blur, the lens moves according to the angle of the gyroscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Blnfge"&gt;Additionally, some iPhone models have closed-loop autofocus (AF).2 Closed-loop AF resists the effects of gravity and vibration to preserve sharp focus in stills, videos, and panoramas. With closed-loop AF, on-board magnetic sensors measure gravity and vibration effects and determine the lens position so that the compensating motion can be set accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLszE5"&gt;The OIS and closed-loop AF systems in iPhone are designed for durability. However, as is the case with many consumer electronics that include systems like OIS, long-term direct exposure to high-amplitude vibrations within certain frequency ranges may degrade the performance of these systems and lead to reduced image quality for photos and videos. It is recommended to avoid exposing your iPhone to extended high-amplitude vibrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CP5Qud"&gt;The iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and all iPhones since the iPhone 7 have both optical image stabilization and closed-loop autofocus (as noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/iphone-camera-vibration-damage-motorcyles/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the first outlet to spot the Apple support post). Both features are also vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208747"&gt;magnetic interference from some iPhone accessories&lt;/a&gt;, Apple warned earlier this year, but removing the accessories should take care of that issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uftGp"&gt;Additionally in the new post, Apple says if you’re planning to mount your iPhone to a scooter or a moped, it recommends using a vibration-dampening mount to lessen the risk to the phone and its camera system. And avoiding prolonged regular use of an iPhone mounted to a vehicle that produces lower-amplitude vibrations is also a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Epic both lost today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r152KsnxYCdWHHQJuuXmgDp2L4U=/169x0:1789x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842855/apple_fortnite_1984_parody.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple stands to lose billions; Epic failed to #FreeFortnite&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1FqWtG"&gt;It was May 11th, the seventh day of the Epic v. Apple trial, that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;hit upon a compromise&lt;/a&gt; neither company had asked for. She asked Epic’s economist, David Evans, if it would be sufficient to kill Apple’s anti-steering rules — the ones Apple uses to keep developers from &lt;em&gt;even telling you&lt;/em&gt; that there’s a perfectly good external website where you can purchase your subscription instead of inside the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLxfFU"&gt;On May 24th, the final day of the trial, Judge Gonzalez Rogers hinted she was still leaning toward that exact sort of compromise, one that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/epic-apple-judge-signals-her-ruling-won-t-make-either-side-happy?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;might not please either side&lt;/a&gt;, one that might involve Apple’s anti-steering rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SA3Xn7"&gt;That’s what happened today. Both sides lost. But Epic arguably lost more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Epxqqc"&gt;In a win for developers — but not Epic — Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ruled for a permanent nationwide injunction&lt;/a&gt; blocking Apple &lt;em&gt;not only&lt;/em&gt; from keeping iPhone users in the dark about alternate ways they can pay, but potentially allowing developers to actually stick their own purchase mechanisms into their own apps. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;It heavily depends on how the courts define a “button,”&lt;/a&gt; so stay tuned for a lot of friction and experimentation around that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW3CDv"&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a win for Epic for two reasons: First, because the judge explicitly decided that Epic’s injection of its own direct payment scheme into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on iOS — a move designed to provoke this entire lawsuit — was not okay. Epic breached its contract with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JXm2BZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic didn’t free Fortnite even a little bit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qrW493"&gt;Second, because even if Epic &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; want to now insert, say, a PayPal button into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, it can’t: Apple terminated Epic’s developer account when the company breached its contract, and Judge Gonzalez Rogers confirmed that Apple is completely within its rights to keep Epic off the App Store for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE366n"&gt;“Apple has the contractual right to terminate its DPLA with any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion,” ruled Gonzalez Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20O647"&gt;Epic also directly lost some $3.6 million, which it has to pay Apple. That’s because Epic made roughly $12.2 million in revenue with the direct payment mechanism it injected into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; against Apple’s rules, and Gonzalez Rogers decided that Apple deserves its 30 percent cut of that money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TknsXL"&gt;Indirectly, you could argue that Epic also lost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22412899/epic-apple-trial-rules-investment-app-payment"&gt;its considerable investment&lt;/a&gt; in making this lawsuit a success — not only legal fees, which it won’t recoup, but potentially hundreds of millions of dollars from people who would have been playing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on iOS if not for its removal from the App Store. In its first two years, the game made $614 million on iOS alone, according to Epic’s records — $52.7 million of that in Q4 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8cfay"&gt;After &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was removed from the App Store, it’s possible people who’d already installed the game kept on making purchases, but it’s unlikely they did it at scale: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;players on Apple hardware lost cross-play, access to new events and new things to buy in August 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402547/fortnite-epic-games-apple-ios-macos-two-different-games"&gt;when the game effectively split in two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjvWco"&gt;And all Epic has to show for that money is… well, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436444335751393283"&gt;the biggest change in App Store history&lt;/a&gt;, as Mark Gurman points out. (Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;our just-published history of the App Store’s major policy changes&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see for yourself.) It’s just that, as of right now, Epic can’t take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuTgGp"&gt;But those millions or even hundreds of millions pale in comparison to the billions Apple stands to lose if that App Store change is thoroughly adopted and legally enforced. Apple makes roughly $19 billion a year from apps, $6.3 billion of that in the US where the ruling has legal weight, and it wouldn’t take more than the loss of a few whales for Apple to notice a dent in that revenue, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;my colleague Chaim Gartenberg argues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BDD4YN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Epic v. Apple ruling could put a serious dent in Apple’s $19 billion App Store business","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"},{"title":"The Apple App Store: a brief history of major policy changes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"},{"title":"The future of the App Store depends on the difference between a ‘button’ and an ‘external link’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VSQAKp"&gt;Epic isn’t even bothering to spin today’s ruling as a win, and I think that makes some sense: publicly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368065/epic-fortnite-players-apple-block-updates-next-season-warning"&gt;its goal was to #FreeFortnite&lt;/a&gt;, and it completely failed at that. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on iOS is still under Apple’s lock and key. So instead of changing its tune, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"&gt;Epic will simply appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD6W0e"&gt;Apple, however, is calling the decision a “resounding victory.” That also makes sense seeing how it downgraded Epic’s original request for the courts to call Apple an illegal monopoly under the Sherman Antitrust Act all the way to a single injunction under the California Unfair Competition Law. The courts aren’t forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores, or sideloading, or to change its 30 percent fee in any way at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFaZWh"&gt;But a true victory wouldn’t have left Apple watching billions of dollars in revenue potentially slip out the door, or losing any control at all (or, for that matter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;seeing Apple’s true nature as a cutthroat business entity&lt;/a&gt; exposed to the world). Apple prefers to make far smaller concessions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;like when it volunteered to Japanese regulators&lt;/a&gt; that it could allow a specific category of “reader” apps to bypass its store for payments — even though Apple has the first and last word about whether an app qualifies to be a “reader” app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Wx3M9h"&gt;I think Jason Schreier &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1436372920285204481"&gt;has it exactly right&lt;/a&gt;: with millions and billions of dollars out the door respectively, both companies lost this fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUb6bX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So Epic lost on just about every count &amp;amp; will have to pay millions, while Apple now has to let apps use external payment processors, potentially costing them billions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big win for everyone who was rooting for both companies to lose &lt;a href="https://t.co/7V2o9PoSRz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7V2o9PoSRz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1436372920285204481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Judge says Apple may be ‘stretching the truth’ on Mac malware concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WT78OBjVXFiPS-ksPeOd2a7T5Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842145/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rxJEyX"&gt;During the &lt;em&gt;Apple v. Epic&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple software leader Craig Federighi argued that tight control over the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"&gt;was necessary for securing the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers didn’t buy it, writing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;in her ruling&lt;/a&gt; Friday that he may have been “stretching the truth for the sake of the argument.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BLF0Y"&gt;Federighi cast heavy doubts about whether Apple would be able to secure iPhones without its App Review system acting as a gateway, by saying that the macOS security &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;was basically in a bad place&lt;/a&gt;. Judge Rodgers doesn’t think Federighi has the proof to back it up (you can read her quotes below in context on page 114): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JlACaa"&gt;While Mr. Federighi’s Mac malware opinions may appear plausible, they appear to have emerged for the first time at trial which suggests he is stretching the truth for the sake of the argument. During deposition, he testified that he did not have any data on the relative rates of malware on notarized Mac apps compared to iOS apps. At trial, he acknowledged that Apple only has malware data collection tools for Mac, not for iOS, which raises the question of how he knows the relative rates. Prior to this lawsuit, Apple has consistently represented Mac as secure and safe from malware. Thus, the Court affords Mr. Federighi’s testimony on this topic little weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uLbYm3"&gt;Woof. Basically, Judge Rodgers says that Federighi was trying to make the Mac look bad so iOS could shine, without much evidence. After discussing notarization and App Review a bit more, she concludes that Apple could implement a system similar to the Mac’s without giving up much of the security iOS already enjoys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GXEznr"&gt;Ultimately, the Court finds persuasive that app review can be relatively independent of app distribution. As Mr. Federighi confirmed at trial, once an app has been reviewed, Apple can send it back to the developer to be distributed directly or in another store. Thus, even though unrestricted app distribution likely decreases security, alternative models are readily achievable to attain the same ends even if not currently employed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TtDFd2"&gt;It’s worth keeping in mind that Judge Rogers didn’t end up forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores or side-loading, and that this opinion is only contending one of Apple’s points. But it’s sharp criticism of Apple’s more prominent defenses of its locked-down approach to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFbYaW"&gt;Epic argued at trial that Apple could achieve security and privacy on iOS without controlling the exclusive way to distribute apps. It suggested that Apple could use a system similar to the Mac — by scanning apps before they run, and checking to see if it’s the same code that Apple has notarized. While the Mac notarization process doesn’t currently include all of the checks that happen in App Review, in theory it could if Apple wanted it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIscoZ"&gt;Federighi strongly disagreed that this would be sufficient. He argued that iPhones have more sensitive data than Macs do, that the iPhone’s popularity makes it a bigger target than Macs, and that Mac users have basically just learned to be more careful when installing apps. He also argued separately that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;isn’t happy with where security is on macOS&lt;/a&gt;, and said that adopting the same security model would be a “very bad situation for [Apple’s] customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2ReD5r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Craig Federighi explains why the Mac’s security wasn’t good enough for the iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"},{"title":"Apple must allow other forms of in-app purchases, rules judge in Epic v.

The Mac’s Notarization system currently doesn’t keep away the kinds of problems that App Review does (or, at least, is supposed to), but there’s no reason why it couldn’t. Even if Apple doesn’t want to implement it onto iOS, perhaps it could consider taking her suggestions to heart if its unhappy with the state of macOS security.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Epic v. Apple ruling could put a serious dent in Apple’s $19 billion App Store business</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdSysz"&gt;The App Store may never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luTZbh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;Today’s ruling&lt;/a&gt; from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial mandates that Apple must allow all developers the option to point directly to other payment systems, in addition to Apple’s own in-app purchasing system (IAP). It’s a decision that cuts right to the heart of the roughly $19 billion a year the App Store brings in for Apple, because at the end of the day, the App Store makes most of its money off in-app purchases inside free-to-download games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLxulz"&gt;It’s not a total sledgehammer to the heart of Apple’s walled garden; the ruling still maintains the App Store as the only place that users can go to to buy or download new apps, and doesn’t challenge Apple’s 30 percent cut of those purchases. And the ruling only technically impacts US-based companies for now, which &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-stands-to-lose-a-few-billion-dollars-annually-from-ruling?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes only makes up about $6.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; (or about a third) of Apple’s global App Store revenue, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqPIpz"&gt;But for companies that make free apps with in-app purchases, subscription apps, and virtually any kind of app or service that doesn’t require an upfront payment to purchase the app itself, it’s a whole new ball game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d5aHrr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The App Store is a &lt;em&gt;remarkably&lt;/em&gt; top-heavy enterprise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qiTqVX"&gt;An often-overlooked fact about the App Store is that it is a &lt;em&gt;remarkably&lt;/em&gt; top-heavy enterprise. It would only take a few developers to make a huge impact on Apple’s roughly $19 billion per year business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1eFkh"&gt;Reports from SensorTower &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;cited by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 claimed that more than 95 percent of the App Store’s total revenue comes from the top 2 percent of developers, with the remaining 98 percent of developers making less than $1 million per year (which, in turn, qualifies them for reduced fees through Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohFvEZ"&gt;And, as the injunction reveals, the vast majority of App Store billings come from gaming. Games account for approximately 70 percent of the entire App Store’s revenue, and 98 percent of in-app purchase revenue. The App Store is a game store, and more specifically, it’s a game store for massive, free-to-play games that make nearly all of their money from in-app items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1sKIkG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The App Store &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a game store; 98 percent of all IAP is games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ax44sL"&gt;A quick glance at lists of the top-grossing apps on the App Store seems to confirm those numbers: almost every single game on the list is a free app that relies exclusively on in-app purchases to make money (with the exception of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, which is a paid app &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aA49ork8ArCP2ttn3S3oLw_Ev9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840276/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An excerpt from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ ruling detailing App Store revenue breakdown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wbQ1Aq"&gt;It won’t take many customers changing their mind to make big waves in how much money Apple makes, either. As the ruling explains, the 70 percent of App Store revenue from games comes from just 10 percent of all App Store users; over 80 percent of customer accounts generate “virtually no revenue” at all for either Apple or developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1kKOu"&gt;That assumes, of course, that developers are willing to adopt the soon-to-be added option for alternative payment methods when the court mandated date of December 9th arrives. And that’s pending any appeals putting this ruling on hold — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"&gt;Epic has already announced its intent to appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUIo94"&gt;There are plenty of details that will need to be worked out. Will developers be able to offer a PayPal or Stripe button, or will they have to link out to external sites? Will Apple be able to require that developers charge the same price for third-party payments, or will devs offer discounted prices to account for not having to pay Apple’s cut?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ywZrny"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We will immediately start working on a build of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/heyhey?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@heyhey&lt;/a&gt; where users can sign-up and pay from the app. Proud to have played a small part in the events that lead to this. &lt;a href="https://t.co/s0ZxTaerpN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/s0ZxTaerpN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1436356844570689546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVt2AY"&gt;Some developers immediately announced plans to offer a payment alternative. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1436356844570689546"&gt;Hey&lt;/a&gt;, which had its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;controversial fight with Apple last year&lt;/a&gt; over in-app payments, said less than an hour after the news broke that it would implement a version of its app that allows users to directly pay as soon as possible. Hey presumably won’t be the only major app to make the switch, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xq6RRm"&gt;But there will likely be plenty of developers who won’t offer an alternative payment — Apple’s own payment systems do offer some benefits, as Halide developer Sebastiaan de With tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re honestly quite pleased with the smoothness of Apple’s offering for payments — from handling taxes all over the world to refunds, Apple Pay, and more — so we’re unlikely to change the way we do business at present.” Smaller developers may simply not have the resources (or the desire) to implement their own payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7t6COt"&gt;The new change may mean that more money could flow through iOS apps than ever before. In theory, there’s nothing stopping Netflix from putting a full signup queue in its app now, instead of the simple sign-in button it currently offers for new accounts — or letting Spotify offer its Premium subscriptions directly to customers without Apple taking a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ax7o1m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle link to the web to sign up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8SDeDl"&gt;The ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;builds on a smaller App Store change&lt;/a&gt; made last week. Apple had previously conceded to let “reader” apps like Spotify and Netflix link out to a payment page in a settlement with the Japan Fair Trade Commission, but that applied to apps that didn’t make Apple money anyway. Today’s court injunction, on the other hand, applies to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; apps — including the ones that contributed the most to the App Store’s bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxOsUi"&gt;Under the new rules, Apple won’t see its full cut of many big apps’ payments anymore. If developers — and customers — take up the chance to pay for their in-game items and dating app swipes in a different way, Apple may not have just lost a big chunk of control over the App Store; it might be losing a big chunk of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;its services business&lt;/a&gt; for good. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple App Store: a brief history of major policy changes </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F7PUnd0Ooh7SIgjg0DXHPjcNaEw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841512/acastro_210831_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The pace of change is quickening even as Apple tries to stop it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gH3bi2"&gt;Apple’s app store policies have caused controversy and consternation many times over the years, but few periods have been as active and strange as the last two weeks. For the first time, we are seeing Apple being forced to react directly to lawsuits and regulators with substantial policy changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ksp8v4"&gt;The biggest example has of course just happened today: a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ruling from judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case&lt;/a&gt;. Apple must now allow apps to link out to other purchasing options in addition to in-app purchases. But that follows two court case settlements and a new law in South Korea that also have implications for how Apple treats developers. The pace of change is increasing and instead of leading, Apple is reacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kc04Fq"&gt;Apple will surely appeal the Epic ruling, but even if it ultimately loses, there’s a good chance that it won’t be enough to appease the legislators and lawyers who are circling Apple’s store as the main way to rein in Apple’s power. And there’s an even better chance that the developers who must try to navigate all those rules will also continue to feel like Apple is spending more effort protecting its profits than empowering developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lAdqWf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starting in 2019, there is an increased cadence of changes in reaction to controversies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe8RoO"&gt;Here, then, is a very brief history of the major policy changes and statements Apple has made about the App Store over the years. The impetus for these different changes (or, as Apple tends to call them, “clarifications”) has varied, but the trend has remained the same. Apple has worked hard to keep the fundamental, central model of a 30 percent cut intact while softening it around the edges to appease various constituencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAGEfu"&gt;But just take a look at the timing and cadence of these changes. After a development period from 2007 to 2011 when Apple fills out the features, there’s a large gap when Apple made few notable policy changes. Then, a major shift in 2016 to address some growing discontent among developers. And then, starting in the summer of 2019, there is an ever-increasing cadence of controversies and policy tweaks to address them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WptOz"&gt;As time goes on, policy changes are coming faster and the hairs Apple is splitting are getting thinner. My instinct is to say that enough is enough: Apple should just make a couple of sweeping changes and get it all done at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEiPV0"&gt;Clearly, Apple doesn’t agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGeu0u"&gt;Instead, the company is in a defensive crouch, stepping back only when forced and as little as possible. That might be a good strategy to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1433300497813815304"&gt;make sure every regulator feels like it got its pound of flesh&lt;/a&gt; and thus minimize the change Apple will have to make, as Steven Sinofsky speculated, but it’s a terrible strategy for making developers — and customers — feel good about the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bPidhv"&gt;
&lt;p id="F0QDxT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 11th, 2007 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;At WWDC, Steve Jobs says that Apple won’t have the ability for developers to install “native” apps, but instead will need to use web apps. It was the infamous “&lt;a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2007/06/13/a-very-sweet-solution/"&gt;sweet solution&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG0Ljf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 17th, 2007 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple changes its mind as it becomes clear that the demand is there (and as the home brew app movement gains momentum). It announces it will release an &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/apple-confirms-iphone-sdk-coming-next-year/"&gt;SDK for the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUjRqw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 10th, 2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html"&gt;Apple App Store for the iPhone launches&lt;/a&gt; with 500 apps and a 30 percent cut of all sales going to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjAwSw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7th, 2008 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview with Nick Wingfield, Steve Jobs says of the App Store that “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mobile-industrys-never-seen-anything-like-this-an-interview-with-steve-jobs-at-the-app-stores-launch-1532527201?utm_source=Memberful&amp;amp;utm_campaign=5ed0c8b80c-daily_update_2018_08_23&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-5ed0c8b80c-110908273"&gt;we don’t expect this to be a big profit generator&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="a57VCB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t expect this to be a big profit generator.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MjCntE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 8th, 2009 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple announces that developers will be able to add &lt;a href="https://marco.org/2009/06/20/the-economics-of-in-app-purchase"&gt;in-app purchases &lt;/a&gt;using Apple’s payment processing (and 30 percent cut). It limits in-app purchases to paid apps, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpLdM3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 15th, 2009 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple changes its mind and allows &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/15/apple-announces-in-app-purchases-for-free-iphone-applications/"&gt;in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; to be extended to free apps. It drives a huge shift in business models for many games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh3o6S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb. 1st, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html"&gt;Apple begins rejecting apps that don’t use its in-app purchasing system&lt;/a&gt;. It rejects Sony’s e-reader app. Apps are not allowed to link out to purchase or subscription pages within their apps, even if the user completes the purchase in a separate browser window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QrEf6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb. 15th, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a big new push to bring news and magazines into Apple’s ecosystem, it &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/02/15Apple-Launches-Subscriptions-on-the-App-Store/"&gt;launches subscriptions on the App Store&lt;/a&gt; for publishers. Fees are still 30 percent, and Apple makes it easy to unsubscribe — and hard for publishers to gather data about their readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBJ7hA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 28th, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we learned in discovery for the recent &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418828/apple-app-store-commission-30-percent-phil-schiller-2011-epic-lawsuit"&gt;Apple executive suggests cutting App Store commission&lt;/a&gt; in an internal email on this date. As we all know, that didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf6GQ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jan. 15th, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5311364/apple-settles-with-ftc-over-in-app-purchases-tim-cook-says"&gt;settles a case with the FTC over in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; and offers consumers $32 million in refunds. It’s a response to a raft of apps using tricky tactics to get in-app purchases. Over time, more parental controls, restraints on those purchases, and oversight on apps are added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DL5TzJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 9th, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/19/7249917/apple-swaps-free-for-get-in-app-store"&gt;changes the button naming&lt;/a&gt; on the App Store from “free” to “get,” to better reflect that some games have in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="jVhHJs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Now we’re going to open up to all categories, and that includes games, which is a huge category.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQ5OLNmgzrmm0oFqQJh0vyzX4pY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13085425/jbareham_160607_1080_0005_final_02.0.0.1465351786.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cOkYA1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 16th, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a massive and consequential change to the app economy, Apple introduces a much-expanded model for subscriptions for apps. It was big enough that our article on the event dubbed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/8/11880730/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview"&gt;App Store 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. The changes included dropping Apple’s fee to 15 percent after the first year of subscription revenue. This is also when Apple introduced &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160618044341/https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"&gt;the concept of the “reader app”&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial category that allowed users to access subscription content purchased elsewhere (like Netflix or Kindle) but disallowed linking out to those purchase options. Finally, Apple announced it would begin introducing ads in App Store search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSfemg"&gt;The change was so big that at that year’s WWDC, Apple &lt;a href="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/App-Review-Guidelines-The-Comic-Book.pdf"&gt;commissioned a graphic novel&lt;/a&gt; where the art told one story but all the text was literally the App Store rules. In one section, we see the story of a son getting a haircut for his father’s funeral while the captions list the “acceptable” business models in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whNxT0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 1st, 2016 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 2020 House subcommittee investigation revealed that in 2016, Amazon has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;secret deal&lt;/a&gt; with Apple that grants it lower fees than were available to other developers. Earlier in 2020, Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;attempted to claim&lt;/a&gt; the deal was an “established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers.” Even if it was “established,” it certainly wasn’t widely known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvyZgJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 5th, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;During its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple quietly updates its guidelines to allow for so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17430532/apple-app-store-rules-valve-steam-link-game-streaming"&gt;remote mirroring apps like Steam Link&lt;/a&gt;. It didn’t allow for full game services on the App Store, but carved out the ability to mirror a PC on an iPhone or iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KU1JZ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 28th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A controversy grows over Apple’s crackdown on developers who use enterprise tools for managing iPhones to offer parental controls to consumers. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519888/apple-screen-time-app-tracking-parental-controls-report"&gt;Apple needed to publicly explain why it was banning those apps&lt;/a&gt;. The move was viewed as anti-competitive because Apple had its own parental controls. Apple countered that those enterprise tools could be misused by hackers in a consumer context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50sQQY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 29th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple publishes a new webpage (since changed) titled &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190529141133/https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/principles-practices/"&gt;App Store Principles and Practices&lt;/a&gt;. It was essentially a marketing page designed to explain Apple’s rules for the App Store and why it believed those guidelines protected consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Varub9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18653142/apple-mdm-parental-control-screen-time-app-store-guidelines-update"&gt;another quiet update during WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, Apple updates its guidelines to allow enterprise tools to be used for parental controls, allowing them to use mobile device manager and VPN APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxrmCf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 12th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692228/apple-banned-parental-control-ourpact-mdm-app-store-control-back"&gt;Apple begins restoring banned parental control apps&lt;/a&gt; to the App Store following the controversy earlier in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grKKJJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1st, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the date we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;officially learned about the so-called “established” program&lt;/a&gt; for video streaming providers to bypass the 30 percent fee for individual video rentals and purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="fWLDrr"&gt;

&lt;p id="oUzZY3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 22nd, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In what turned out to be a big controversy for the App Store, an email app called Hey is banned because it did not offer a way to sign up for the $99 / year service inside the app itself. At issue was that “reader” app category — only those types of apps were allowed to use that business model and Apple said email didn’t count. On this date, Hey made a minor change to its app to skirt Apple’s requirement that apps provide functionality without an outside subscription and so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;Apple approves the Hey email app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxM5cW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 6th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a new battle, streaming games platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;Stadia and Microsoft’s xCloud are officially banned from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s ruling requires every game on the services to be submitted individually — a nonstarter for those services. Ultimately both would eventually return as browser-based apps after Apple quietly added the necessary Safari support for them to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTQiDD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 13th, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicks &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; following Epic’s gambit to add its own in-app purchases to the game. It would kick off a huge battle — both in the court of public opinion and in actual court. The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case would turn out to be a major event in the App Store saga, revealing all sorts of internal emails and ultimately leading to consequential rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWPSH2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 18th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an attempt to hang on to its 30 percent cut but still grant smaller developers some concessions, Apple introduces the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;.” Developers who make less than $1 million per year were allowed to apply to join the program and have their cut reduced to 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qj6fna"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 11th, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple makes it official that streaming game services are allowed in the App Store, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if each game inside the services are submitted individually&lt;/a&gt;. It is still not enough for Stadia and xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BjuyJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 23rd, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a new 16-page report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546771/apple-side-loading-security-risk-report-regulatory-pressure"&gt;Apple lays out its arguments against allowing sideloading iPhone&lt;/a&gt; apps in a report titled “Building a Trusted Ecosystem for Millions of Apps,” claiming the practice would make its phones less secure and trustworthy for users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PpH2rR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has had to change more App Store policies between August 26th,2021 to September 10th than in any other period in its history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uw1ZMM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 26th, 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple announces another new program offering a lower rate to a subset of developers. Under the new program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642902/apple-news-partner-program-lower-commission"&gt;news publishers that participated in Apple News to a sufficient degree qualify for a 15 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; on their other apps instead of 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuZn3X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 26th, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;settles a class action lawsuit with developers&lt;/a&gt;. In the proposed settlement, the company “clarifies” that developers are allowed to email their users directly with information about how they could subscribe to services outside the App Store. It’s unclear if this is actually a change and even if it is, it’s a tiny one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsgi0n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 31st, 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;new law in South Korea requires both Google and Apple to allow for third-party payment systems&lt;/a&gt; on apps in their respective app stores. It’s too soon to see how the companies will react and what the law’s effect both inside and outside South Korea will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtYNI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 1st, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another lawsuit settlement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle have a single link out to their payment services inside their apps.&lt;/a&gt; It’s a tiny crack in the so-called “anti-steering” rules, but it’s limited to a single link and limited to the so-called “reader apps” category that Apple itself has defined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZX3O9U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 10th, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple rules that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666146/apple-epic-korea-fortnite-developer-account-rules-response"&gt;won’t allow &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to return to the App Store in South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, despite the new law there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rBnZlc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 10th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;huge ruling in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the judge says that Apple is “permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.” It is also established that Apple does not have an illegal monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYUFPs"&gt;Appeals from both Epic and Apple are expected. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s California Streaming event: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7lIjwP_ApyJCBpE3hsGPPd2zsM=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841421/Apple_California_Streaming_Event_Promo_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT on September 14th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="4jNRlj"&gt;Autumn is quickly approaching, which to Apple aficionados can mean only one thing: the next iPhone is just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTkCLy"&gt;Apple’s upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;“California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; on September 14th will likely introduce more than just the iPhone 13, however. Rumors point toward a new Apple Watch, the Series 7, as well as the next iteration of the AirPods.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nrAUh"&gt;Reports and leaks indicate the new iPhone 13 lineup will feature four models that will come in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;same sizes as last year’s models&lt;/a&gt;. The new phones will likely boast high refresh rate screens, a smaller display notch, and a faster A15 Bionic chip. On the camera front, we may see the introduction of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618070/apple-2021-iphone-13-camera-features-video-portrait-prores-ai-filters"&gt;video portrait mode and an astrophotography mode&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an improved ultrawide lens and a better optical zoom for video recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKkGRw"&gt;We also expect Apple to debut the third generation of AirPods, which may take on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;similar design&lt;/a&gt; to the AirPods Pro, with a new case and shorter stems. As for the Apple Watch 7, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;rumors indicate&lt;/a&gt; it will include a faster processor and sport its first hardware redesign in years, with flatter edges, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;new watchfaces&lt;/a&gt;, and larger screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTwsG2"&gt;New MacBooks and an updated iPad Mini could potentially show up, too. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; will likely include Apple’s new, custom-designed chips and bring back previous inputs, like the HDMI port and SD card slot. The next iPad Mini, meanwhile, will reportedly feature its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;biggest revamp in nearly a decade&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a larger display and a design that closely mirrors last year’s iPad Air. We also can’t write out the possibility of a few surprises or updates to Apple’s many services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7amfL"&gt;Regardless of what’s announced, however, we’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here as new products and services are shown.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The future of the App Store depends on the difference between a ‘button’ and an ‘external link’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vy4Q_o9osraEtBdhj7-upmYhknw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841408/acastro_210831_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MT0tTw"&gt;Today the judge in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; issued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;a lengthy ruling&lt;/a&gt; holding that Epic failed to prove that Apple has a monopoly in mobile gaming transactions. Importantly, the court &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; held that Apple’s rules preventing other payment options in the App Store are anti-competitive, and issued an injunction telling Apple to cut it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksxyl2"&gt;Specifically, the court said that “Apple is engaging in anticompetitive conduct,” and that “Apple’s anti-steering provisions hide critical information from consumers and illegally stifle consumer choice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JTP8T"&gt;To fix that, the court issued the following permanent injunction barring Apple from having rules against other payment systems. I’ve bolded the most relevant bit: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EtU3FP"&gt;Apple Inc. and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and any person in active concert or participation with them (“Apple”), are hereby &lt;strong&gt;permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from (i) including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing &lt;/strong&gt;and (ii) communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xjEJAT"&gt;This specific wording is lifted directly from &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase"&gt;Apple’s App Store rule 3.1.1&lt;/a&gt;, which says “Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase,” so it’s tempting to think that the judge just declared that rule anti-competitive and crossed it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ixKZS"&gt;But it’s a little more complicated than that — now that this text is in a judicial order, it no longer belongs to Apple or &lt;em&gt;needs to be interpreted how Apple wants&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, the court was clear that it will enforce this rule, and that if anyone thinks Apple is breaking it, it wants to know. Again, my bolding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VEvUbT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Court will retain jurisdiction over the enforcement and amendment of the injunction.&lt;/strong&gt; If any part of this Order is violated by any party named herein or any other person, plaintiff may, by motion with notice to the attorneys for defendant, apply for sanctions or other relief that may be appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Cn4DTb"&gt;So now comes the &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; complicated part. What does this injunction mean for Apple and the App Store? Let’s break this rule down piece by piece — the difference between a “button” and an “external link” is going to be remarkably important here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x51bDQ"&gt;Apple is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="1yU2zh"&gt;not allowed to prohibit developers from including in their apps and their metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XLnLTS"&gt;buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rMZ1Gz"&gt;external links, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x5STCd"&gt;other calls to action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v3503i"&gt;that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="r7UTkx"&gt;in addition to In-App Purchasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Glj7SW"&gt;We can make some versions of this sentence make sense really easily:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1kGHQd"&gt;Apple is not allowed to prohibit developers from including external links in their apps that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CK5L4c"&gt;Apple is not allowed to prohibit developers from including calls to action in app metadata [like descriptions in the App Store] that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SkVZvS"&gt;But consider the following version of this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="72EBdp"&gt;Apple is not allowed to prohibit developers from including buttons in their apps that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aHyssa"&gt;Well, shit. Here is an example of a button that takes you to a purchasing mechanism in the Amazon app:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “checkout” button in an Amazon cart that has Airpods Pro in it" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uG7zasG_It_epZG_Ls3uTmR5JgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840636/IMG_8A3B35F71848_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A button in an app that directs customers to a purchasing mechanism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BnS3U9"&gt;This is the ball game! What does it mean for a &lt;em&gt;button&lt;/em&gt; in an app to “direct a customer to purchasing mechanisms”? Is it a checkout button? Can Amazon add a cart, a checkout button, and payments to the Kindle app now? The court isn’t stupid — it specified &lt;em&gt;buttons&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;external links&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which means they are presumed to be distinct. So a button can’t just be an external link that kicks you to Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ijTaRJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple will try to say that “button” just means &lt;em&gt;what something looks like&lt;/em&gt;, while developers will say that “button” means &lt;em&gt;how something works&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJx4EX"&gt;That means that a fair reading of the plain text of this injunction suggests that buttons in iOS apps can direct users to purchasing mechanisms &lt;em&gt;in the app — &lt;/em&gt;if the button just kicks you out to the web, it would be an external link!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TA4bSG"&gt;I am confident a lot of developers are going to test this language in aggressive ways, and that Apple will find itself developing new rules to protect its lucrative in-app purchasing system from competition. And I’m confident Apple will try to say that “button” just means &lt;em&gt;what something looks like&lt;/em&gt;, while developers will say that “button” means &lt;em&gt;how something works&lt;/em&gt;. (There is a lot of irony in this for Apple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QM60xD"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3856497645&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a8Ce7v"&gt;But in the end, it won’t be up to Apple to decide what this order means — it will be up to the court. And that is a delicate position to be in, because the court explicitly thinks the anti-steering rule is very anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcgjDg"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment on the difference between buttons and external links.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Fortnite return to iOS? Probably not any time soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eCJaB_ulaSaPjWnk8uFkqhVYh_s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841144/vpavic_180607_2652_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fD3GeK"&gt;The ruling is in on the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;Epic won a major concession&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to allowing alternative in-app purchase options, but Apple won out on basically all other counts. The question now is: where does that leave &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;been out of the iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; since it first violated Apple’s rules by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;offering its own payment options&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAKAE9"&gt;For the moment, it sounds like the game isn’t coming back right away. The judge did not say that Apple would be required to restore the game, and neither Apple nor Epic have indicated that it’ll return any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B1HiVc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic wants “fair competition” before ‘Fortnite’ returns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iX1kN5"&gt;In fact, Epic seems to have indicated that it’s &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;satisfied with the ruling and won’t be restoring &lt;em&gt;Fornite &lt;/em&gt;just yet. In a tweet, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;will return “when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment.” Plus, Epic has already said it plans to appeal the ruling, which raises the question of whether these new rules will even go into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wMbaNu"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3856497645" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmTIqy"&gt;Apple has contended that Epic has been the one holding &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;back all along. The company said earlier today (in response to a new Korean law) that the company would “welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,” which means getting rid of its in-app payments system. Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666146/apple-epic-korea-fortnite-developer-account-rules-response"&gt;tried to have its app restored in Korea&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple rejected it again on the same grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhLttP"&gt;Today’s ruling requires Apple to allow apps to offer buttons and links to third-party payment options — but crucially, it’s not entirely clear whether the specific payment system Epic tried to add to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; will be allowed. If apps want to use another payment system, they can send users &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the app, and Apple can’t stop them from doing so. But there’s some ambiguity on whether a full-on in-app payment alternative has to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t8c9zS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple still has to restore Epic’s developer account&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwrxWG"&gt;It’s likely that Apple will make it difficult for outside payment systems to offer a smooth and integrated experience. It’s possible that gamers will still be required to pop out to Epic’s website every time they want to make a transaction. That’s better than nothing, but Sweeney’s tweet suggests he may not view it as “fair competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3B9MT"&gt;The flip side of this is that it’s not even up to Epic when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;returns. Even if Epic caves and makes the changes, Apple still needs to restore Epic’s developer account and approve &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;for distribution. Apple has said it’s open to this, but Apple’s still the one determining whether Epic is adhering to those rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccJ9kk"&gt;There’s also the question of when and whether these rules go into effect. The ruling doesn’t go into effect for another 90 days, and that’s assuming an appeal doesn’t result in the ruling being put on hold. So the likely result is this: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;won’t return at a minimum until Apple puts new rules into place. We don’t know when that’ll happen, and even then it’s up to both companies to agree that the game is compliant with the new rules. There’s a good chance that’ll take more than 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
