    <title>The next pro iPhone might finally ditch the notch</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9vJ2u"&gt;The iPhone 13 isn’t even here yet, but speculation about Apple’s future phones never slows down. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"&gt;some rumors about Apple’s event last week didn’t pan out&lt;/a&gt;, certain leaks were right on, including analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;information about a smaller notch and high refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDUyx8"&gt;Now Kuo reports (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-to-feature-hole-punch-design-new-48mp-wide-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-hole-punch-48mp-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that plans for next year’s iPhones point to high-end Pro and Pro Max models that ditch the notch entirely in favor of hole-punch front cameras, with 48MP wide cameras on the back. However, Kuo expects that in-screen fingerprint scanning for Touch ID is off until 2023, despite his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754520/iphone-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-touch-id-2021-iphones-face-id-biometric-security-rumors"&gt;earlier reporting&lt;/a&gt; that it could happen as soon as this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iVwJIh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPhone’s notch: should it stay or should it go?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678603/iphone-13-notch-2021-face-id-touch-id"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jZWAMA"&gt;A possible foldable iPhone is even further off, slipping from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo"&gt;previous projection of 2023&lt;/a&gt; to 2024 at the earliest. More immediately, Kuo reiterates expectations of a 5G-equipped iPhone SE next spring and a larger non-Pro version of the iPhone 14 that offers the 6.7-inch frame without the extra Pro features and price bump.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s latest updates lay good groundwork, but don’t add many big new features&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PwF119"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 are strange updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="2SHpRr"&gt;Some iOS updates bring huge new features; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872972/apple-ios-13-review-iphone-update-dark-mode-arcade-maps-photos-siri"&gt;iOS 13 had dark mode&lt;/a&gt; (and a lot of bugs) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;iOS 14 had widgets&lt;/a&gt;. Some, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17862236/ios-12-review-download-features-update-speed-iphone-ipad-screen-time-notifications-siri"&gt;like iOS 12&lt;/a&gt;, brought much needed behind-the-scenes fixes to performance and battery life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="tVZDfx"&gt;But iOS 15 (and its companion, iPadOS 15) does neither. It’s the most incremental and iterative iOS release in years, a grab bag of new features that, while nice to have, don’t really move the needle or change your iPhone experience much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="To4UOa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10763173"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AWaE3Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10763176"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNMjZe"&gt;Looking at the changes and additions in Apple’s latest mobile software, there’s not much to point to in major design changes or UI overhauls; at the same time, Apple doesn’t seem to have made the kind of game-changing performance and battery life improvements that defined quieter updates like iOS 12, or iOS 10’s changes to how it lets third-party apps hook into the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zzBk8T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The most incremental and iterative iOS release in years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yKiKTb"&gt;It doesn’t help, of course, that some of the biggest and most interesting features coming to iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 aren’t actually here at launch. The flashy SharePlay feature has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;delayed to later this fall&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt; — presumably on deck for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey’s&lt;/a&gt; release — hasn’t even popped up to try in beta yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFhSgZ"&gt;Other big features are still in the works, too: the new detailed 3D view for Apple Maps is limited to just New York, London, San Francisco, and Los Angeles at launch, while iCloud Plus’ VPN-like Private Relay will &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-now-considered-a-beta-feature-comes-disabled-by-default-with-ios-15/"&gt;start off as a beta feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Glbkx"&gt;iOS 15 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;already a relatively minor release&lt;/a&gt;, but those delays and omissions leave what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; here at launch feeling even more anemic. It’s not a new vision for Apple’s mobile software as much as a bit of fresh paint and polish for what’s already been here, to the point where it’d probably be fair to call it iOS 14.5 (if Apple hadn’t already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;released that earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1NH9kX03zjMNoq8Xubjz6hdSLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864029/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPAmcE"&gt;Apple’s updates are occasionally hit or miss (looking at you, iOS 13), so before we dive into features, a word on performance and stability: Functionally, the two new releases work well; I haven’t run into any major issues with performance or battery life on the final version of the software. (I will caveat this note by saying that I’ve been testing the new OSes on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, so performance issues here would be an ominous sign.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxhQxn"&gt;With that out of the way, let’s dive into features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hh2fSp"&gt;Coming soon to a FaceTime near you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ur6vlt"&gt;With SharePlay not shipping with the initial iOS 15 release, this fall’s update is (at least for now) missing out on its biggest and flashiest feature. FaceTime itself is getting some updates unrelated to SharePlay, though, chief of which is the ability to create a link to a FaceTime call that you can send to Windows and Android users (who can join through a web browser). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="43CkgQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FaceTime’s bigger updates are coming later this fall&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wEJtSt"&gt;There is also the equally long-overdue grid view, which (combined with the new links) makes FaceTime much more of a viable group video chat solution than it was before. Also added are some new audio features to help your phone better zero in on who’s speaking and a blurred background portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HgTrB"&gt;Even with the new additions here, I don’t think FaceTime is going to replace Zoom or Google Meet as a business solution (nor do I think that’s Apple’s goal here), but iOS 15 does make it much easier to use FaceTime for more casual calls with multiple participants — even if it’s mostly playing catchup here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lC6Po5"&gt;Going on Safari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="J6ftea"&gt;When it comes to changes that will impact virtually every iPhone owner, Safari’s update is the most significant thing in iOS 15. The browser is getting an Apple-wide redesign across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (the latter coming as part of macOS Monterey later this fall), and it’s the biggest visual change in this year’s update by far. It’s also the most controversial new piece of iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, to the point where Apple has added the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629183/ios-15-beta-safar-address-bar-fix-options-accessible-controls"&gt;to opt out&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596478/apple-ios-15-beta-safari-tabs-compact-optional"&gt;most of the changes here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmGO2yAGQXC3WV86tKK_t91wI7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863816/Image_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iOS 15’s biggest change comes to Safari, which has a whole new design.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="teQjFI"&gt;On the iPhone, the default view is still Apple’s new “tab bar” mode, which places the URL bar at the bottom of the display and allows you to swipe between open tabs (similar to swiping between apps on a Face ID iPhone). The relocated URL bar is definitely an adjustment, but after a few weeks, I’ve mostly come around to the new design — being able to swipe between tabs is useful, and Apple’s fixed the behavior of the URL bar so that it stays at the bottom of the page. That said, if you prefer the old style, you can easily switch over to it in the Settings app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="l8I58x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new look for Safari&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2ehQm"&gt;The iPad also gets a new, swipeable tab bar, although it’s located at the top of the display (Apple calls it a “Compact Tab Bar”). Unlike on the iPhone, I much prefer Apple’s old design here, which keeps the URL bar on top and a row of tabs underneath it; the scrolling compact bar is harder to use, and has the unfortunate habit of obscuring the rest of your open tabs whenever you click on it. (Incidentally, it seems that Apple agrees the design wasn’t optimal, as the legacy style “Separate Tab Bar” is the default here.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ljaq1k"&gt;Design choices aside, the new version of Safari also adds a new tab group feature (which syncs between devices through iCloud) to help sort the chaos of all your open websites across your devices, and the ability to install third-party extensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50eQwD"&gt;You can still install a different browser if you’d like (and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444995/ios-14-default-browsers-chrome-edge-firefox-duckduckgo-safari"&gt;set it as a default&lt;/a&gt;), but since iOS 15 still keeps Apple’s limits on requiring all third-party browsers to use Safari’s rendering engine, you still won’t see any performance differences; just a new UI or different cross-platform syncing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7c3fam"&gt;Focus up&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LAahp2fBneoOSZejeQl1_UNz2ds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863908/Image_5.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Focus modes can filter out your notifications for you.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mRH8oZ"&gt;On the flip side of things is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"&gt;Focus modes&lt;/a&gt;, something that I suspect will be ignored by a lot of iOS users. Effectively a souped-up version of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb, Focus modes let you establish specific apps and contacts to ping you at specific times. But it’s a lot more useful than that: Focus modes can intelligently trigger at times of day or at geographic locations, and toggle specific home screen layouts. You can also let iOS 15 intelligently switch Focus modes based on when it thinks you’ll want them on or off, but the automated switching is very hit or miss.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bJdiz"&gt;Practically, I’ve been using Focus modes to create a “Personal” mode that shuts off notifications from Slack, my work email, Google Calendar, and anything else that might pull me back online during weekends or evenings, and it works amazingly well. A “Work” focus mode, on the flip side, kicks in whenever I’m at &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; office or during work hours and does the reverse, shutting down Instagram notifications so I can focus (pun intended) on my job. It also swaps in a new home screen with calendar and email widgets, and quick access to things like my 2FA app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTSdiu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Focus is Apple’s smartest new feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCJj1v"&gt;When you’re in a Focus mode, notifications that come in filter though in a separate bundle (which you can view in the notifications drop down, should you want to double check that nothing’s on fire at work). Apple will also let apps send “time sensitive” notifications that break through Focus limits, for things like your bank urgently letting you know that someone made a withdrawal or if someone rings your video doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol9fg3"&gt;It’s a smarter version of Apple’s previous efforts to make users more conscious of how and when they’re using their phones, recognizing that there might be times when you only want to use some of your phone, without the binary on / off mode that Do Not Disturb is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wm2CtK"&gt;A smarter smartphone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cc5vvf"&gt;Apple’s been beating the local machine-learning drum for years, and iOS 15 has two of its most significant moves in that direction yet: Live Text and offline Siri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i16ZXF"&gt;Live Text still works like it does in the beta, which is to say impressively well. You can point your camera at any text, be it handwritten or typed, and Live Text will pull that information into copyable text.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RN89KRuNmOYH8ceWxGlB-XjQagw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864016/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_10.01.29_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of all the places that Live Text can work and pull text from.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8aANtv"&gt;Live Text works system-wide too: in the camera app, with photos you’ve saved, in Safari, and even in most text fields, you can tap and hold to pull up a “live text” icon in the same pop-up menu that copy / paste commands live in to snag text directly into a message or email. It’s extremely technically impressive, but in the months I’ve been using iOS 15, I haven’t run into many practical applications for it in my day-to-day life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkkjYT"&gt;Siri also now processes speech entirely on device, allowing (theoretically) more secure and faster interactions, as well as offline Siri commands for the first time. Those are obviously limited in what they can do, but you can kick your phone into airplane mode and still accomplish basic tasks like opening apps, setting timers, and toggling settings. I didn’t notice Siri working dramatically faster in my experience, but the added benefits are nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="pgGxsG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10763113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tskkEm"&gt;iOS 15 also marks the rollout of an upgraded version of Apple’s iCloud service, iCloud Plus. The new subscription service is bundled with existing paid iCloud storage subscriptions, and adds a few new features. There’s a new “Hide My Email” service, which creates burner email addresses that forward to your regular account — similar to a feature offered with Sign In With Apple, but one that you can use for services that don’t work with Apple’s login feature. iCloud Plus expands Apple’s unlimited HomeKit Secure Video storage to more of its plan (the base $0.99 / month plan, in particular, is now included) and lets you have an unlimited number of security cameras pipe into it with the 2TB plan (it was limited to just five before). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zp2QKX"&gt;The biggest feature though, is Private Relay, a VPN-style service that aims to mask your internet traffic from your iPhone. There are a few caveats, though, that separate Apple’s version from a true VPN. First is that you can’t use Private Relay to spoof your location (say, for sports or streaming content), since the service only allows you to anonymize your data within your country and time zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CiNsHv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use Apple’s Private Relay feature with iCloud Plus","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A6KQxX"&gt;Second is that it only works in Safari, not other apps or browsers. And lastly, the service isn’t available in several countries, including China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines for regulatory reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo1mN3"&gt;Private Relay also isn’t quite ready to go, either: Apple is releasing the feature as a “public beta” to start in iOS 15. It’ll be disabled by default (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;although it’s simple to turn on&lt;/a&gt;) as Apple works to get more feedback and make sure everything works properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MeO5HY"&gt;The best of the rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XtUEmw"&gt;Apple Maps is rolling out a very fancy looking new 3D map. The new, more detailed maps look great, but they’re &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; limited. At launch, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and London are supposed to be available, but I’ve only seen the new look in the two California cities so far. The additions are nice: trees, bridges, and major buildings now appear in Apple’s stylized 3D view, and streets even show individual lanes when you zoom in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SRD0b2qULBL65TdJu_fLyZzmTZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863909/Image__1__2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Maps looks better than ever.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t7n07n"&gt;There are also new AR directions, better transit directions, and improved driving directions (which use the aforementioned improved maps) to help make sure you’re taking the right lane. A lot of this is stuff that Google has offered for a while, but for those who prefer Apple Maps, it’s good to see that Apple is working to stay up to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCcO3v"&gt;The built-in Weather app has a new design after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;Apple’s purchase of Dark Sky&lt;/a&gt;, adding Dark Sky-style gradient bars for temperature, a Dark Sky-style precipitation notice for the next hour, and Dark Sky-style maps for temperature, precipitation, and temperature. There are also some flashy new animations: a thunderstorm will light up the app with lightning flashes, and rain will bounce off the top of the UI’s boxes and run down the sides of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6x5ScMpN5SxPPFWUP6IFEtTwF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863910/Image_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The new overhauled Dark Sky-style Weather app in iOS 15.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2DtSI7"&gt;Despite the Dark Sky purchase, though, Apple is still relying on a combination of first-party data, The Weather Channel, and other third-party sources for its forecasts (even though Dark Sky produced its own weather data API in the past).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDvWel"&gt;Both the Notes and Reminders have a newly added tag system, along with smart folders that can automatically pull in those notes and reminders using those tags. As someone whose Notes app in particular has become an endless pit of hastily jotted down text, it’s a useful addition (although it’ll be even better once macOS rolls out and I can access them on my computer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZdo7T"&gt;Memoji have clothing now. It’s that kind of update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2KtkH"&gt;There’s a new “Shared with You” section that’s been added to several of Apple’s apps, including Photos, Music, Safari, Podcasts, and Apple TV Plus. It’s a useful reminder of Apple’s vice grip over core services on your phone. If people send you links, photos, Apple Music songs, TV Plus shows, Apple News articles, or podcasts, those pieces of media will now be highlighted in Apple’s corresponding apps. The links and photo aspects are the most useful, surfacing old pictures that friends and family members had sent me over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GAfFgM1OAMxhTf-_cCy0NmXYMD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863954/Untitled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Shared with You pulls links from Messages into a helpful area in Safari.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MkG3YO"&gt;But it’s a very Apple kind of feature: only things sent in Messages will appear, and only Apple apps will work. If a friend sends a link to an Apple Music playlist over iMessage, you’ll see it in the Music app. If they send it over WhatsApp, though, or share a Spotify song instead, you’re out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRcLzd"&gt;Some things still haven’t changed from iOS 14, either: App Library still won’t let you move around or edit app categories, so you’re stuck with whatever Apple classifies apps as. Default app support hasn’t meaningfully advanced from the additions of email and web browsers last year, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hjrSNM"&gt;iPadOS 15-specific updates&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3wMe0aBSVratPby4IXwp-x6BsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864030/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cKW05z"&gt;As I noted back in my beta hands-on over the summer, iPadOS 15 is virtually identical to iOS 15, except for a few iPad-specific improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqJZTO"&gt;Two (mostly) welcome changes are the addition of the widget and App Library system added to the iPhone in iOS 14. Where last year’s iPad update added widgets, they could only be viewed in a specific area on the left of the home screen; now, though, iPad users get the same home-screen widgets that iOS has had for a year, along with the App Library feature (so you can hide apps without deleting them entirely). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DF1M6W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Widgets and App Library finally come to the iPad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="txKT7X"&gt;Apple is offering an even bigger widget size option for the iPad, though, which takes up an entire third of the screen in a four-icon by two-icon grid and is physically about the same size as an iPhone 12 when viewed on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Given that iOS widgets still aren’t allowed to be fully interactive, it’s not the most useful addition, but you can get truly massive calendar previews and contact lists. So far, the best implementation is the Photos app, which can act as a sizable photo frame on your home screen now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4kkzX"&gt;As a side effect of the expanded widget support, though, Apple bewilderingly reduced the number of icons you can have on an iPad home screen in iPadOS 15. On a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the 6x5 grid for icons gets bumped down to a 4x6 grid the second you add a widget, giving the tablets the same layout as an iPhone when incorporating widgets into a home screen layout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rc6Fd"&gt;I’m not entirely sure what Apple’s thinking here is — visual cohesion across devices, perhaps — but the net result is that a 12.9-inch iPad can display approximately the same amount of icons on a home screen as a 5.4-inch iPhone 12 mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="csMfnT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10763118"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcPA2F"&gt;The other big iPad-specific change here is in how Apple handles multitasking. As I noted over the summer, Apple is largely sticking with its existing system, built primarily on split-screened applications and floating sidebars.  What is new, here, though, is a multitasking menu that’s designed to make it easier to set up (or exit out of) split-screen app views, or to move an app into a hovering sidebar view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vda8Q"&gt;There’s also a new “shelf” view, which appears as a sort of in-app dock that shows all the open windows you currently have open for a specific app, similar to the Control-Down command on a Mac. The app shelf pops up whenever you open an app, or when you tap the multitasking bar, and helps make it easier to wrangle different app windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FF4Af9N1315jqutZsvpK1yH_Hig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863833/Image_3.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The updated Safari on iOS 15, along with a look at the new multitasking bar and shelf view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5IzQCb"&gt;Notes on the iPad is getting a new Quick Note feature, which is tailor-made for the Apple Pencil — swipe up from the corner of the screen, and you can jot down a quick note (as the name implies). It pairs really nicely with last year’s handwriting recognition additions, too. On the flip side, it’s another flavor of pop-over window in an OS that already has enough modal things going on without a great way to organize them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN4sap"&gt;After using an iPad with the final version of iPadOS 15 for a few weeks, though, it’s clearer than ever that even with the new changes, it’s still the same old iPad multitasking. My thoughts haven’t changed from when I first tried an early beta this summer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oNcEcq"&gt;iPadOS remains unpredictable: I’m never 100 percent sure what version of an open app or app windows will open when I tap in on my home screen. Just opening a new window is still an opaque process that involves dragging and dropping things around in split view. Slide-over panels still live in their own, separate confusing world. Split view is still frustratingly rigid, letting you have exactly two apps open with a third visible as a slide-over panel, instead of any other configuration (like one large app on the left and two smaller ones on the right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xyf6yH"&gt;Ultimately, the new multitasking and split-screen views are a refinement of the older system, rather than some grand new paradigm for how to use an iPad. Those who like the iPad’s software abilities will likely find the new additions and enhancements to those modes nice. But those who were hoping that iPadOS 15 would offer a wildly overhauled windowing system — especially in the wake of Apple’s M1 upgrade in the latest iPad Pro — are going to be disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PZggfpVl5M6_JpZzlNh3_GWGYLc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863809/59685084_413aa480_91d3_11e9_9d1f_2c943317f650.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;There’s still a LOT going on with iPadOS 15’s multitasking, though.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N6OLHz"&gt;The most interesting feature coming to iPadOS, however, is Universal Control, which promises a new, seamless way to jump back and forth between a Mac and an iPad using a single mouse and keyboard. It’s the sort of thing that could offer users the best of both worlds of Apple’s computing vision, but we’ll have to wait to see how it actually works later this year; it’s not shipping yet, or even available to try in a beta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMxFso"&gt;And, since this is an iPadOS review, I have to note that, once again, Apple has refused to add multi-user support in iOS 15, a feature that it offers on both macOS devices and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/multiple-users-atvb59ec8e2e/tvos"&gt;Apple TVs running tvOS&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also no weather app (despite Apple now owning a company that makes an iPad weather app), no calculator app, and — especially relevant for anyone with ideas of using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;new iPad mini&lt;/a&gt; as a defacto smartphone — no phone app. Maybe next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-BK4B14v-hTBEigt0Sjb9MHLTfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864033/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="B2a3HU"&gt;Here’s the good news: your phone or tablet will not be worse off for installing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. Unless you really, really hate Apple’s new Safari design (which, following a series of beta changes, are less dramatic in the final version than when they were first revealed), it will likely be better. But the ways that iOS and iPadOS are improving are smaller than ever. The new features are more subtle, and the changes — while still helpful improvements generally — won’t really change how you use your phone or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imB4bn"&gt;I noted in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;initial preview earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it felt like a lot of these changes were simply being saved up for a big fall release, even if it would have been possible and made more sense to release them earlier (like many of the FaceTime features, which would have come in handy during the earlier, even more isolated stage of the COVID-19 pandemic). But on the other hand, had Apple done that, it’s hard to see what it could have used as the centerpoint of its Big Annual Software Update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pzeSxD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;After a decade and a half of OS updates, there’s simply fewer things to left to fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfSS5R"&gt;And maybe that’s the point. iOS is now on its 15th major version, a number that doesn’t count significant point releases (which have been tending towards more substantial updates in their own right). Apple has spent a lot of time making it into a great mobile operating system, but after a decade and a half of improvements, updates, and tweaks, there’s less it needs to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B553my"&gt;As the saying goes, if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it, and 15 versions in, there’s not a lot left in iOS that needs to be fixed. There’s almost certainly going to be bigger iOS updates in the future, massive platform changes like iOS 7 or macOS High Sierra that rethink what the iPhone looks like and works like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gAbPNy"&gt;But those inflection points are few and far between, and the future of iOS updates will probably look more like iOS 15: smaller and subtler. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 deals are extra aggressive this year, here’s why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3_zMQMnkK42DgY00r3QevGnIqA=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882128/lcimg_78e65da1_4e90_4b7e_a300_6bce2342e8ea.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="px24Oy"&gt;“You get free iPhone upgrades for life!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzwceT"&gt;“You get a $500 gift card for switching carriers!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buZXND"&gt;I can almost hear Oprah shouting the many competing offers from all the carriers — AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon — as soon as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; was over. They’re all offering huge incentives to entice you to trade-in an old device, switch carriers, then sign up for a top-shelf cellular plan. If you’re in the market for a new carrier and iPhone right now, you can probably land yourself a “free” iPhone 13 (or only pay a nominal fee for the flagship iPhone 13 Pro Max), even if you’re preordering before the phones hit stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwjtSF"&gt;Many of these offers seem too good to be true and are a bit surprising to see on new iPhones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407894/apple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;historically have sold themselves&lt;/a&gt;. Who can ignore Verizon for giving you a $500 prepaid MasterCard gift card, just for ditching your carrier? How about the sky-high trade-in offers that all the carriers are advertising, like the too-good-to-be-true offer of giving you $350 for a used Samsung A50, which retails about $180? Across the board, the carriers are particularly aggressive with their signup offers this year, as detailed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;in our preorder guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D05T4he8paoSK__to_e-rJJhEN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858831/lcimg_17b9e15c_0998_429c_bb51_493611b203d6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s pricing for the new iPhone 13 models isn’t out of the ordinary — but few people will actually pay that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n0jSDK"&gt;Whether you choose T-Mobile, Verizon, or AT&amp;amp;T, all the offers fit the same basic premise. In exchange for a discount on the newest iPhone 13 device, after you trade-in an older device for whatever value, you’ll be paying for the balance of your device in monthly installments. You also must qualify and sign up for a typically more expensive unlimited plan that ties you to your phone and carrier for at least 24-months — or 36-months if you go with AT&amp;amp;T. The new plan will also likely control when and what device you can upgrade to next, which helps carriers and phone manufacturers better forecast the demand for devices and gives you that “free” upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pMgu7z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To some extent, we’re back to the subsidy model that existed a decade ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nulRvV"&gt;For those iPhone 13 shoppers who are already happy with their carriers or existing data plans, or just want the latest unlocked device on a pre-paid plan, the carriers won’t extend as generous offers to you. If you’re already an existing customer, at minimum, you have to be willing to upgrade to the premium plans at Verizon, an unlimited plan at AT&amp;amp;T if you’re not already on one, or take a lesser trade-in offer at T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qopFGV"&gt;It is clear that carriers want to take back control over your upgrade cycle by offering scheduled upgrades and want to lock you into a bigger plan than you need by dangling an almost free phone. Sound familiar?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq5k6z"&gt;“The offers are more generous, but the big picture is that we’re seeing a shift from the EIP [Equipment Installment Plan] model to the subsidy model,” according to Wave7 Research’s principal analyst Jeffrey Moore. “To some extent, we’re back to the subsidy model that existed a decade ago, when people routinely got an iPhone for $200, but paid higher monthly rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr8mjv"&gt;It also may seem like Apple is the one that is driving much of these promotions, as more iPhones sold is always beneficial for the company. But as much as Apple needs people to buy new iPhones every year, carriers need the sales even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkgz5V"&gt;According to Wave7 Research’s monthly surveys of retail wireless stores in the US, “more than 60% of smartphone activations at national carrier stores are of iPhones, with remaining activations being of Android devices, with Samsung having dominant Android share.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svV2PO"&gt;Carriers also have an extra incentive to nudge customers toward iPhones this year: the on-going global chip shortage has really affected the supply of Android phones, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676054/t-mobile-cfo-peter-osvaldik-samsung-supply-no-note"&gt;Samsung phones in particular&lt;/a&gt;. In Wave7 Research’s August 2021 survey of retail stores, it found the “supply of the base Galaxy 21 has been particularly weak for Verizon in the U.S., with multiple Samsung models out of stock online.” With a new round of iPhone 13s flooding retail stores, it’s not hard to see why carriers have an incentive to sell iPhones rather than Androids right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="y57ghv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chip shortages have made other phone models difficult to stock&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mxLTYe"&gt;It doesn’t hurt that service providers also need to shore up their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;5G user base&lt;/a&gt;, as they continue to expand the (fractured) 5G network in America. If iPhones are the lures that can hook customers to upgrade to an all-inclusive, multi-year data plan, then the carriers are in for the kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTO7Sm"&gt;The truth is, Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629003/us-phone-upgrades-apple-samsung-market"&gt;holding onto their phones longer&lt;/a&gt; than they used to (remember the annual upgrade days?), with each generation of phone being more iterative than innovative. While that’s great news for our wallets and the environment, this trend does carriers no favors — they don’t exactly make the most money when we buy unlocked phones and order pre-paid plans or hang on to our phones for three years or more. Now that new iPhones are on the market, this is the time for carriers to once again capture some new customers with shiny iPhone 13s and fancy plans with built-in upgrade cycles — hook, line, and sinker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVINRa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, September 20, 2021, 12:20PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the new upgrade offers from AT&amp;amp;T were only available to customers who are willing to upgrade to the new unlimited plans. The AT&amp;amp;T deals are actually also available to existing customers with unlimited or grandfathered unlimited plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 will give doctors a window into Apple Health app data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saxony Struggles With Covid-19 Infection Rates That Are Germany’s Highest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/luP1bOpS4PD_QA1cqpQYRrS4ko0=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882756/1296121438.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ViFomt"&gt;With the iOS 15 launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;, some iPhone users will have the option to share data from their Health app directly with their doctors through their electronic medical records. Six health record companies are participating in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526024/apple-health-app-data-medical-record-iphone-doctor-access"&gt;initial launch&lt;/a&gt;, and some of those companies say that doctors and medical practices on their systems are eager to start using the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvrvPU"&gt;People who use the option can use the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-personal-health-by-introducing-secure-sharing-and-new-insights/"&gt;new sharing function on the Health app&lt;/a&gt; to let their doctor see data like their heart rate and time spent exercising, as collected through the Health app. It could help physicians keep a closer eye on metrics that might be relevant to a patient’s health without the patient having to take an extra step to manually share the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyBDmD"&gt;Electronic health records company Cerner, which controls around &lt;a href="https://www.ehrinpractice.com/largest-ehr-vendors.html"&gt;a quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the records market, is one of the companies in the launch. Right now, any healthcare organizations that use Cerner’s records have to balance time spent implementing new tools against time spent managing COVID-19 surges, Sam Lambson, vice president of interoperability at the company, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But they’re interested in the feature, he says. “Once our client organizations have seen a demo and understand it, the questions are mostly around how quickly they can get it implemented,” Lambson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4Hsbg"&gt;A small number of healthcare groups that use electronic health records through Allscripts, which is also part of the launch, have already been using the feature as part of a test phase, says Tina Joros, the company’s general manager and vice president. They’re able to use it with a select few patients. “They’ve got all of the technology in place, and when it’s available for patients, they can start promoting it out to their patient population,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1K61S"&gt;One of those test groups is especially excited about the new ability to see patient data from an at-home blood pressure monitor, Joros says. The physicians at that medical practice typically recommend a particular brand of blood pressure cuff to patients who they want to monitor between visits. That cuff already syncs with the Health app. So if patients chose to share the data, the doctors are able to directly track those blood pressure readings instead of relying on patients to share it more manually. “It really helps the data come full circle,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy9AEG"&gt;Daniel Kivatinos, co-founder and chief operating officer of health records company DrChrono, says he’s heard similar feedback from health providers about the Health app feature. “One of our customers, the provider is excited that they’re going to be able to do remote patient monitoring,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IM28VC"&gt;While the data provided by wearable devices and other health apps can be useful, doctors often say they’re worried about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"&gt;information overload&lt;/a&gt;. Joros at Allscripts says the layout of the dashboard within Apple’s health record might help make the flood of information less overwhelming. The default is to give a general overview of the trends in a patient’s Health app. Doctors have the option to see more detail but don’t have to. “We had a good reaction both from our client testers and from our internal physician staff,” she says. “Both liked the way that those dashboards were laid out to help reduce that burden.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTNShW"&gt;DrChrono plans to roll the Health app feature to a first set of initial users before expanding gradually to its full customer base, which includes around 4,000 medical practices. The company can track how often the feature is used, and Kivatinos says it plans to collect data on how many patients end up sharing their Health app information into the health record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVhV7h"&gt;Allscripts plans to collect similar data as well. The company will be able to see exactly how many patients use the feature, Joros says. She’s expecting the usage to gradually ramp up in the same way as the other Apple health records program, which launched in 2018 and lets patients pull data from their health records onto their iPhones. “We have seen the usage consistently go up,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Succession, You, Nightmare Alley, Hawkeye, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hS2w7hodnxRlEtNpKzX5MPAOQ4=/0x0:1406x937/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69879850/kendall_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kendall Roy, smiling because he is happy Succession is returning soon (probably) | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevqiiYNFrc&amp;amp;t=1s&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBO" target="_blank"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KzOhz2"&gt;OK so the latest &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;spends almost the entire episode on Coach Beard in its most unusual, dream-like episode ever. I didn’t hate it (and I know it’s one of the two episodes added to the mix after &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-08-13/ted-lasso-christmas-episode-apple-tv"&gt;Apple said it wanted 12 episodes&lt;/a&gt; instead of the 10 the writers had already sketched out. The Christmas episode was the other), but I wish we had actually gotten to know Beard a little better. “I listen more than I talk” seems like a line that could be his mantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHLlsu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; is back and honestly the first episode seemed rushed to get certain characters to do specific things we as the audience know they must do in order to have a show at all. I’ll stick with it for a bit, remembering that this was a show that took a little while to find its groove in season 1, but the first offering felt a little more chaotic than usual. Billy Crudup keeps me coming back, to be honest; he makes Cory such a likeable weasel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pak65O"&gt;This week’s trailers include a dysfunctional family, a serial killer, a carnival charlatan, and a classic musical. Never let it be said that I don’t try to add some variety to these roundups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTLU6M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="49czGb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kevqiiYNFrc?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mnB2Vq"&gt;Succession&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6bZCgQ"&gt;The squirmiest show on streaming about awful rich people (yes even more awful than you, &lt;em&gt;White Lotus&lt;/em&gt;) is returning for a third season and the Roy family has never looked more dysfunctional. The fallout from the bombshell Kendall delivered in last season’s finale appears to be a central plot line as the Roys decide which side they’re on and how to keep the family business— toxic as it may be— from going under. Cousin Greg is as awkward as ever in this trailer as he informs Kendall he is the “number one trending topic ahead of tater tots.” And Logan is as angry as ever, shouting that he’s ready to go “full fucking beast.” God I missed this show. Adrien Brody, as a billionaire activist investor, and Alexander Skarsgard, as a tech founder and CEO, have joined the show for the upcoming season. Jeremy Strong, Brian Cox, Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin, Nicholas Braun, Matthew Macfadyen, and J. Smith Cameron return in the third season of &lt;em&gt;Succession, &lt;/em&gt;coming &lt;em&gt;to &lt;/em&gt;HBO Max October 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aVz2Dm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYb3B1ETlk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="E200u0"&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="skY9Ro"&gt;So I was not aware this would be a Christmas show but sure, let’s roll with it. &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; picks up after the events of the &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; movie, with Clint Barton just trying to enjoy the holidays in New York City with his family when he discovers there’s a new bow-wielding vigilante in town. The trailer has a decidedly jocular tone, which is kind of a new thing for this character. Jeremy Renner, Hailee Steinfeld, Vera Farmiga, Fra Fee, Tony Dalton, Zahn McClarnon, Brian d’Arcy James, and Alaqua Cox star in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus on November 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="evFJSI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAN1ThhTWsE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2aNCuJ"&gt;You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="j1A7lI"&gt;Netflix’s show about the serial killer/stalker next door who found his perfect match in season 2 returns for a third season, and Joe and Love are now parents which seems a little problematic? Joe of course has fixated on a new target for his obsession and Love is not super happy about it. Penn Badgley, Victoria Pedretti, and Saffron Burrows return for season 3, which adds Tati Gabrielle, Dylan Arnold, Shalita Grant, Travis Van Winkle, Scott Speedman, McManus, Shannon Chan-Kent, Ben Menhl, Chris O’Shea, and Christopher Sean to the cast. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; comes back to Netflix October 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fSuU7c"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-qVV8zyVmI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BHaGHG"&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LJw9vW"&gt;Based on the 1946 novel by William Lindsay Gresham, Nightmare Alley is not a supernatural film, director Guillermo del Toro said in an &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/09/nightmare-alley-guillermo-del-toro-awards-insider"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Given his body of work, it’s not a surprise people might make that assumption. The story revolves around a con man and former carnival worker who convinces people he can read minds. The all-star cast includes Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Toni Collette, Willem Dafoe, Richard Jenkins, Rooney Mara, Ron Perlman, and David Straithairn. &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qi7mJI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5GJLwWiYSg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eEUcRK"&gt;West Side Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Vu72Ar"&gt;We got a teaser for Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt; in May, but this is the first official trailer and I am a little perplexed that it focuses on the plot— of perhaps one of the most famous American movies based on a Shakespeare play which is itself very famous— instead of the songs? At least we get to see snippets of the dance numbers and some words of wisdom from Rita Moreno: Anita in the original 1961 film, who has a small role in this remake and served as a consultant to Spielberg. Ansel Elgort, Rachel Zegler, Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist, Josh Andres Rivera, Ana Isabelle, Corey Stoll, Brian d’Arcy James also star in &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zadoU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gBR4e1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmv92GzD0pY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EO2iMP"&gt;Bonus: Foundation first look trailer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sgY6Re"&gt;With less than a week to go before this massive series hits Apple TV Plus, we get a first-look trailer with commentary from stars Jared Harris, Leah Harvey, Lee Pace, and Lou Llobell, and writer David S. Goyer, who calls Foundation (the book) “the greatest science fiction work of all time.” Adapted from the Isaac Asimov books, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; drops its first episode on September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVqpRl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R1NTTq"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PNgDXB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save $800 on this 55-inch OLED TV at Best Buy this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgS4pyfvxQNptZIAgXccbWC55JA=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876143/153092_tv_review_sony_a8_4k_oled_tv_review_image1_bgco4tcqtp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Slim and sharp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FgcRHO"&gt;OLED TVs have developed a reputation for being sharp, clean, fragile, but also remarkably expensive. But this weekend you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfBzVgpkkUy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save a whopping $800 on this 55-inch OLED TV&lt;/a&gt; from Sony at Best Buy. At just 2.3-inches thick without its stand, the A8H, much like other OLED screens, is impossibly slim. This makes it ideal for wall mounting especially for anyone in pursuit of that ultra-clean, Ikea catalog aesthetic. In terms of apps, the A8H has access to the Android TV catalog and offers voice control via Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple AirPlay2. Besides having 4 HDMI ports that include a single audio return channel, the A8H also has a trio of USB ports and built-in Bluetooth for everything else.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5OkHSV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y3arKN"&gt;One of our biggest issues with the Razer Nommo Pro when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17898382/razer-nommo-pro-review-consumers-producers-thx-dolby-stereo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;originally reviewed it in 2018&lt;/a&gt; was the overall cost, but this sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nommo-Pro-Certified-Illuminated/dp/B07DNSLL24?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon knocks more than $100 off the original MSRP&lt;/a&gt;, making it a far more attractive prospect. This THX-certified speaker system is one of the best ways to beef up your desktop audio without investing in a dedicated receiver. The system itself is composed of a pair of standing woofers and tweeters, a volume control knob, and a trashcan-sized subwoofer that serves as the hub that connects to your desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JcsGWP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758930"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BIFgP6"&gt;It’s tough to say no to a good pair of Beats, and right now you can grab a pair of the Beats Solo 3 Wireless in select colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo3-Wireless-Ear-Headphones/dp/B07YVYPNRH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbeats-solo-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-79437096%3Fpreselect%3D79358892%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $131, their second-best price to date. The well-built headphones are compatible with Android and iOS devices and can last for up to 40 hours on a single charge before needing to be topped off via MicroUSB. They sound decent enough, too, and pair effortlessly with iOS devices thanks to Apple’s integrated W1 chip. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our review in 2016&lt;/a&gt; took some issue with the original sticker price of the Solo 3 Wireless, but this sale definitely makes the on-ear headphones far more appealing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dTwSmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9hjeuE"&gt;If your desktop or PS5 needs a little extra breathing room, right now you can grab the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsamsung-970-evo-plus-2tb%2Fp%2FN82E16820147744%3FItem%3DN82E16820147744" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung 970 EVO Plus (2TB) at Newegg for just $250&lt;/a&gt;. No bigger than a stick of gum, this SSD is one of the easiest ways to expand the storage outside of finally cleaning out your downloads folder.....the OTHER downloads folder. These drives can be easily installed on any motherboard with a free M.2 slot, and thanks to a recent firmware update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;your PS5 as well&lt;/a&gt;. Besides providing you with more storage space, the faster transfer speeds can help cut down on load times for games as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h3LG9e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5aDHQ"&gt;If you’re looking to substantially upgrade your home theatre and are okay with spending an equally substantial amount of money, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-HW-Q950A-11-1-4ch-Soundbar-Dolby/dp/B08X1CH646?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfBzRYNK7Tv#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have knocked $300 off the incredibly popular Samsung HW-Q950A Soundbar. We haven’t had a chance to test this ourselves, but a quick trip to Google will reveal a list of glowing reviews, from Wired, Reviewed, and Techradar to name a few. Even a cursory glance at this absolute lad of a soundbar reveals that that praise is well warranted. This soundbar includes 11 speakers as well as a pair of upward-firing rear speakers and a subwoofer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyT2OY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10759046"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ew12SD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>8 new HomeKit features arriving with Apple’s September 20th software updates  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFrB4RSo4qr_67XyNG51mEUjUcU=/0x400:2400x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874081/apple_wwdc21_watchos8_home_doorbell_06072021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sm4we8"&gt;With new iPhones come new features. And starting next week, Apple HomeKit users will get plenty courtesy of iOS 15, HomePod 15, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8 software updates. Apple has confirmed that these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;will all be available on the same day, September 20th&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k51FQ2"&gt;So, if you’ve been excited about unlimited HomeKit Secure Video cameras, the HomePod Mini as a speaker for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22672587/apple-tv-tvos-15-features-release-date"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;, or the chance to see your doorbell on your Apple Watch, you’re in luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vn6TDY"&gt;Here’s a look at all the new HomeKit and HomeKit-related features that will be dropping on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jo8NY2eGt7DG9iorfWFYTw-oYsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22025414/dseifert_201107_4281_0005.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new software update will let you pair a single or pair of HomePod Minis to your Apple TV 4K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6Won2G"&gt;Control your Apple TV with Siri on HomePod Mini&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="w9RK6D"&gt;Finally, you’ll be able to use Siri on your HomePod Mini to turn your Apple TV on and off, start a specific show or movie, or have it pause or resume playback for you. This has been a feature of Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant’s smart speakers for a while now (when paired with a Fire TV device or Chromecast), and we’re pleased to see Apple bringing Siri’s mini speaker up to par.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tFdFkO"&gt;Set your HomePod Mini as your Apple TV speaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxwnW"&gt;A single or pair of HomePod Minis can now be your Apple TV 4K’s default speaker. This feature was previously only available to the original (now discontinued) HomePod, but now it’s available for Apple’s more diminutive (and not discontinued) smart speaker. Additionally, the HomePod Mini can be the output for other audio devices using ARC / eARC, if your television has those inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxuJOq-o28fiEPHDe-8suVrAQzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541099/DSCF3862_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple TV 4K can now show you multiple HomeKit camera feeds on the biggest screen in your house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gUE4J2"&gt;Have your HomeKit cameras spot packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pLPGEg"&gt;Security cameras connected to Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video (Apple’s option for storing footage from your smart home cameras) through an Apple TV 4K or HomePod Mini can now tell you when they see a package. This is in addition to people, animal, and vehicle detection and will increase the usefulness of the two HKSV compatible residential doorbells currently on the market — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163585/logitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video"&gt;Logitech View&lt;/a&gt; and the Netatmo Smart Video Doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SRazyy"&gt;See multiple HomeKit cameras on your Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Im16Y5"&gt;The Apple TV can now stream multiple feeds from your HomeKit cameras instead of only one, so you can survey your domain from the big screen. It will also offer up control of nearby accessories such as a porch light, so you can turn on the lights using the remote,  no need to get your phone out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OMjPaC"&gt;Add unlimited HomeKit Secure Video cameras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oVMCFU"&gt;Speaking of multiple cameras, with the iOS15 update on your iPhone and iPad you can now add an unlimited number of cameras to HomeKit Secure Video if you sign up for the new iCloud Plus 2TB plan ($9.99 a month). Previously, 5 was the maximum number allowed, which is a bit limiting if you want to cover a whole home inside and out with cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrV3g8Rm4NYnw6didqLbXbN_KBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16308986/dseifert_190530_3460_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ecobee SmartThermostat is the first confirmed Siri-enabled accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sKsTIh"&gt;Talk to Siri in more places&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vqGlQF"&gt;The voice assistant is coming to other speaker-enabled HomeKit accessories. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features"&gt;Ecobee SmartThermostat&lt;/a&gt; is the only confirmed accessory so far — and the function won’t go live for a few more weeks, according to Ecobee. But it’s likely more devices will follow soon, enabling you to ask Siri to control smart home devices, set timers and alarms, and use the intercom feature in more rooms in your home. You will still need to have a HomePod Mini on the same network for the device to relay the requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AQaTqY"&gt;Tell Siri to do something later&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6VW0TX"&gt;Siri is getting smarter about home control, adding the ability for you to ask the voice assistant to do something later or based on an event. That means you’ll be able to use commands such as “Hey Siri, turn off the lights when I leave home,” or “Hey Siri, turn off the TV at 6 p.m.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vpr6RaUnkXF2S_If_9TwlUqEZrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858560/apple_wwdc21_watchos8_home_doorbell_06072021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new software update for Apple Watch lets you view your HomeKit doorbell camera feed on your watch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Enr29Y"&gt;Control your home on your wrist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zXy3Gj"&gt;With WatchOS 8, the Apple Home app gets a much-needed redesign. Now when you access individual accessories as well as HomeKit Scenes, the watch will use context to determine which ones to offer up for control. You can also now view HomeKit-enabled camera feeds from a doorbell camera directly on your wrist and use Intercom to quickly broadcast a message to the whole home, individual rooms, or personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wj04Cg"&gt;To update your HomePod and HomePod Mini’s software, go to the Home Settings in the Apple Home app (you can turn on automatic updates here). For Apple TV 4K, look in the settings menu on your device and for the Apple Watch, use the Watch app on your iPhone or the settings app on the watch itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPp7E6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:26AM ET, September 18th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that the article is referring to Siri on a HomePod Mini, not the discontinued HomePod, to control the Apple TV. Added the information that the HomePod Mini can also be the audio output for other devices through ARC / eArc. Clarified that the new feature for accessing accessories and Scenes on the Apple Watch is that the Home app offers up relevant accessories and Scenes using context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmail-1essHD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 8:26AM ET September 18th 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this article stated the update will let you view camera feeds on your watch and that you can unlock a door using HomeKit on AppleTV. You can already view video feeds on the Apple Watch, the update adds the ability to view feeds from a doorbell camera. You can only control secure accessories such as door locks through a personal device not through the Apple TV interface. We regret the errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDtToU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder Apple’s new iPad and iPad Mini</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJh377rgCk0xrZL9VTIMCiq3dLo=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857722/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ztdXBm"&gt;As expected, Apple’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;California Streaming&lt;/a&gt;” was loaded with a flurry of announcements, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also used its annual fall showcase to introduce its latest tablets, specifically the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;ninth-gen iPad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;all-new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is a follow-up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;2019 iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; that takes heavy design cues from last year’s iPad Air. The new models are set to launch on Friday, September 24th, starting at $329 and $499, respectively, and preorders have already gone live at several retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgwE0u"&gt;We’ll have reviews up for both models in the near future, however, if you’re looking to purchase Apple’s latest tablets ahead of release, you have a few options to consider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yMH3Z4"&gt;Where to buy the all-new iPad Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U3t2M7"&gt;Spec-wise, the new iPad Mini is a far cry from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3576178/apple-ipad-mini-review"&gt;original iPad Mini model&lt;/a&gt; and one of the bigger revamps to come to Apple’s smallest tablet since it made its debut in 2012. The sixth-gen model features slimmer bezels, an A15 Bionic chip, and a larger, 8.3-inch display. Like the iPad Air, the forthcoming tablet also ditches the aging home button, adds USB-C support, and incorporates a Touch ID sensor within the top-mounted power button. It also supports 5G and Wi-Fi 6, works with the second-gen Apple Pencil, and features a 12MP ultrawide camera on the front, allowing for the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt; Apple introduced with the iPad Pro last year. Additionally, like the ninth-gen iPad, it ships with iPadOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fECKGb"&gt;The latest iPad Mini comes in two different storage configurations, 64GB and 256GB, and in four colorways (purple, pink, starlight, and space gray). The 64GB configuration retails for $499 and the 256GB model for $649; both models are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91LXFP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FiPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Starlight%2F211557522&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664337-REG%2Fapple_mk7m3ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752240155828388288#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-64gb%2F-%2FA-84619867%3Fpreselect%3D77615852%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; with shipments expected to arrive before the tablet’s launch on Friday, September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rnMmYG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPad Mini doesn’t support mmWave 5G ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678389/apple-ipad-mini-no-mmwave-downclocked-a15"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="0DybVI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jyQB1V"&gt;Like the Wi-Fi model, the iPad Mini with cellular connectivity is available in two sizes: 64GB and 256GB. Both come in an array of colors — purple, pink, starlight, and space gray — with prices starting at $649 and $799, respectively. Both configurations are also available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9GM743/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-Mini-2021-Wi-Fi-Cellular-64GB-Space-Gray%2F664584591&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664343-REG%2Fapple_mk893ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752241079262357667#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-cellular%2F-%2FA-84619869%3Fpreselect%3D77615846%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lsq6xQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743742"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CBe2E6"&gt;Where to buy the new entry-level iPad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iZJ1f5"&gt;The entry-level iPad remains the most popular tablet in Apple’s lineup. The ninth-generation model keeps the same name the tablet has had since its introduction in 2010, but showcases several updates, including a new processor called the A13 Bionic, which is supposedly 20 percent faster than the outgoing model. Thanks to a 12MP camera on the front, the forthcoming device also supports Apple’s aforementioned Center Stage feature, however, the rest of the updates are more trivial. The new iPad still comes equipped with the same 10.2-inch display as before — this time with Apple’s True Tone technology — as well as a Lightning port, home button, and a single rear camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blvpwY"&gt;The new iPad comes in two different storage configurations, 64GB and 256GB, and in two colorways, silver and space gray. The 64GB configuration starts at $329 and the 256GB model for $479; both models are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-10-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F674982024&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664329-REG%2Fapple_mk2k3ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752241380893659528#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-10-2-inch-ipad-wi-fi%2F-%2FA-84619866%3Fpreselect%3D54184190%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments set to arrive before the tablet’s official launch on Friday, September 24th. Walmart is even &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F674982024&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently offering a $30 discount&lt;/a&gt; on the base model, bringing the final sale price down to just $299 for the 64GB, Wi-Fi configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XTmmmK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ8Eig"&gt;Like previous models, the ninth-gen iPad also comes in a cellular configuration, which is available in both 64GB and 256GB storage capacities in one of two colors (silver and space gray). Both storage configurations are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-10-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9GLLRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-Mini-2021-Wi-Fi-Cellular-64GB-Space-Gray%2F664584591&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664333-REG%2Fapple_mk663ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752241665105047552#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, with the 64GB variant retailing for $459 and the 256GB model for $609.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the new iPad Mini compares to the last-gen model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uNIGnSInoXv8c60SeRkas4LCdgg=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874379/lcimg_29dd1c6f_2141_4080_b52a_db12ce0673ef.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad Mini (2021) is the latest in Apple’s line of smaller tablets.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yVuL8X"&gt;With the announcement and impending release of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; and its revamped design, it might be all too easy to stan the new model and completely write off its predecessor. While the new model has a lot to offer — namely a larger screen, faster processor, refined design akin to the 2020 iPad Air, and a USB-C port — it also has a quality that is not so desirable: a higher introductory price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLobXP"&gt;The iPad Mini line has been notoriously discount-immune over the years, possibly because of its specialized position in the market and lack of competition. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;outgoing iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; only recently started receiving significant discounts, falling to $300 soon before the new model was announced, but it started at $399 from the get-go. The new iPad Mini starts at $499 before you add anything further, like extra storage or 5G connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoiSPN"&gt;So let’s go over what makes the new iPad Mini different, and if it merits the $200 price premium over its two-year-old predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kWTH6E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s iPhone 13 event: the 8 biggest announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNokVD5epfyoanYvxROAZ9oLPTc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850130/apple_event_2021_1046.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini for 2021 packs more screen and modern design in a diminutive size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fW1Guf"&gt;What’s improved on the 2021 iPad Mini?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tA9ela"&gt;The new iPad Mini has a bigger screen in a slightly smaller physical footprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n69sTd"&gt;Apple’s A15 Bionic processor replaces the aging A12 Bionic from 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A7O1mJ"&gt;The front camera has more resolution and supports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; to zoom in and keep you centered during video calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lYeJBw"&gt;The rear camera is higher resolution and can now record 4K video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gdxpod"&gt;USB-C all the things! (except iPhones, sadly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GEAZDV"&gt;No more Apple Pencil sticking out of the port to charge: second-gen Apple Pencil neatly attaches to the side to charge magnetically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SNPmtZ"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 compatibility &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GV0uQs"&gt;5G connection on cellular models for potentially faster speeds than LTE, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678389/apple-ipad-mini-no-mmwave-downclocked-a15"&gt;lacking mmWave 5G radio bands&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MNixNm"&gt;The showstopper for the new iPad Mini is its screen, now an 8.3-inch display. It may not sound like a massive difference compared to the 7.9-inch display on the 2019 model, but the new tablet is actually a touch shorter while squeezing in a larger screen. More screen real estate and smaller bezels in nearly the same footprint is generally a good thing that makes everyone happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUu690"&gt;As for processing power, the new iPad Mini features the same brand-new A15 Bionic chip you’ll find in the iPhone 13 lineup, with five GPU cores like the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max. (That’s one more than the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini.) Apple claims the new chip gives the Mini a maxi performance boost, with 40 percent CPU gains and 80 percent GPU gains over the older A12 Bionic in the outgoing model. There’s talk of it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678389/apple-ipad-mini-no-mmwave-downclocked-a15"&gt;not being clocked quite as fast as the A15 processor of the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, but that remains to be confirmed and the improvements over the previous iPad Mini are likely noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zB6GzP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The camera tech of the iPad Mini sounds like a solid upgrade on paper&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JLvnc"&gt; A 12MP ultrawide front camera replaces the 7MP selfie cam from 2019. More resolution on the front camera may not sound like the most important thing in the world, but the big appeal should be that the new iPad Mini supports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; for keeping you centered during video calls. The quality has also been improved — while still 1080p, it has improved dynamic range with more frame rate options for video and Smart HDR 3 for photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfaFFh"&gt;As for the rear camera, there are similar resolution and recording gains with a 12MP sensor and brighter f/1.8 aperture, replacing the prior 8MP @ f/2.4. The faster aperture should be helpful in low light, and for when it’s way too dark there’s now a quad-LED True Tone flash where the 2019 model had no flash at all. On the video side, the new model is the first in the iPad Mini line to offer 4K video recording at up to 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncuFA65v4fZQrYnuxxe0gdDFiPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850183/lcimg_90987419_14bd_47ba_b425_5984e2255904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini comes in four colorways: space gray, purple, pink, and starlight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d4ll3L"&gt;The latest iPad Mini now aligns with the iPad Pros and 2020 iPad Air by replacing the Lightning connector with USB-C. Apple spoke extensively of the flexibility that USB-C brings to the iPad Mini, even though for some reason the new iPhone doesn’t receive the same treatment. This offers more versatility for charging and connecting devices, such as full-size cameras or game controllers. You also get the faster 20-watt USB-C charger in the box, while even a $1,600 iPhone 13 Pro Max does not come with a charging brick at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H29froDJmJ7jGd02m_Yr6TsF07M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13358115/Apple_Pencil_Bad_Design.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This charging design is still bad, and it should feel bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YWVICT"&gt;The iPad Mini line became compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil in 2019, awkward charging method and all. With the new iPad Mini, you don’t need to leave it sticking out the side: it supports the newer second-gen Pencil, which can wirelessly charge while it magnetically docks to the tablet’s side rail. It’s a much more slick and seamless way of getting more functionality out of this little tablet. If you also want to add a keyboard to the mix, there are wireless Bluetooth options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxU9aM"&gt;Lastly, the cellular-equipped configurations of the new iPad Mini are 5G-compatible where the predecessor only has LTE. As for if 5G truly gets you faster speeds, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;you know the drill&lt;/a&gt;. But whether you achieve those faster speeds or not, having a mobile connection on such a portable device is convenient. A 5G iPad Mini (2021) will run you an additional $150, pushing the price to $649 (before carrier fees). Ouch. At least all 2021 iPad Mini configurations have Wi-Fi 6, allowing for faster speeds at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KHBfrZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="I8pkqR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758598"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GOxbwa"&gt;What’s the same on both models?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7ktDMN"&gt;While the new screen is larger, it has the same number of pixels per inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OjITJc"&gt;Both screens are laminated to minimize the gap between cover glass and screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zFOavb"&gt;Maximum brightness of 500 nits for both panels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j92pzj"&gt;Touch ID fingerprint sensors are present on both – just in different locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pdsk3o"&gt;Apple quotes the same battery life for both&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TYzAjL"&gt;Storage capacity still starts at 64GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZC10WG"&gt;Weight is practically identical (within 8 grams)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MvoelB"&gt;Both run iPadOS 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FU4YeT"&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the screen is the standout of the new model, but you should keep in mind that the pixel density is the same on both. The 2021 iPad Mini has a resolution of 2266 x 1488 and the 2019 iPad Mini has a 2048 x 1536 panel, which both translate to 326 ppi. So both screens should look equally sharp, though the 2021 model is giving you more screen real estate. Also, both screens are laminated, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;base-model iPad&lt;/a&gt;, so the pixels should look like they come right up to the cover glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHW3Zx"&gt;Another similarity is storage capacity. The new and old models both start with 64GB of storage and can be outfitted with 256GB for an additional $150. This might be a disappointment for some, especially given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675300/apple-64gb-iphone-13-128gb-standard-storage-space-photos-videos-apps"&gt;iPhone 13 models doubled their base storage to 128GB this year&lt;/a&gt;, though. You may want to do some personal bookkeeping and see how much storage you currently use before paying extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ijGU5leA7gYTi_720eLC0BfzSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850355/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini’s Touch ID sensor is now in the power button, opposite the volume buttons on the top rail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EwtSd2"&gt;What about software, though? Well, there’s not a whole lot to say. The new iPad Mini will ship with iPadOS 15, and the 2019 model will be eligible to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;upgrade on September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The only main difference between the two tablets is the new model’s reliance on more gesture-based controls, due to its removal of the home button that is still present on the 2019 model. Since the new model ditched the home button, its Touch ID fingerprint sensor is built into the sleep/power button on the top — which is also where the volume buttons are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="W8yhf2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The outgoing iPad Mini (2019) still has some merits in 2021, especially if you’re on a budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EGMMfc"&gt;Why might you stick with the 2019 iPad Mini?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fkPZxB"&gt;Price: the older iPad Mini is currently on sale for $200 less than the new model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VQfGg6"&gt;It’s still a fine tablet even today, with more years of updates to come&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xVvxRb"&gt;It has a headphone jack!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="T6FEN6"&gt;Classic home button operation for those who prefer it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="A4n2Uo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="986U7H"&gt;The outgoing iPad Mini still has more than a few great things going for it. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is frankly depressing to lose on the new model. All tablets — even mini ones — should have enough room for a headphone jack, but that’s a rant for another time. The 2019 iPad Mini also has the classic physical home button on its front, complete with Touch ID. The gesture controls of newer Apple products may not be for everyone, and there are still many who love the clicky home button. There’s no shame in picking up a 2019 iPad Mini in the year 2021 because you value these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQj2x3"&gt;After all that, there’s the consideration of pricing. Slightly aged tech always has the added benefit of discounted prices before they’re no longer available. With the jump in price of the new iPad Mini, a $200 price delta is nothing to balk at. The 2021 iPad Mini has priced itself nearly into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; territory, and there are good arguments to be made for why you should maybe consider the Air instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hjqxpv"&gt;But if you’re in the market for a small tablet, the choice is primarily between these old and new iPad Minis. Like I mentioned, there’s not much competition in this space, which is why discounts have not always been common. The outgoing model should still have years of updates in store for it, and there’s a wide ecosystem of compatible accessories — most likely also with cheaper prices attached to them. We’ll have a full review of the iPad Mini in the weeks to come, and we’ll see if its new features justify the higher price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How and where to replace your old, depleted iPhone battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0mWSVXrKcWvnqpLBF_jKjRUrh0=/0x27:620x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873726/F8M9LXDIM0THNI6.MEDIUM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Credit: Apple Fixer/ Instructables&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKJuw9"&gt;Your iPhone’s aging lithium-ion batteries will eventually start to lose their ability to retain a charge — and that can be highly frustrating, especially if you’re out and about all day. If that is happening to you, there are several solutions: you can switch over to the latest &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPhoneBattery091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, start carrying a battery charger around with you, or — simply replace the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OPFe7"&gt;To first identify whether your battery is ready for a change, you can check to see what the current health of your battery is by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Battery” &amp;gt; “Battery Health.” This is where you can find out your battery’s current maximum capacity. A small notice at the very top may appear if your iPhone’s battery is ready for a swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Battery” page in your iPhone’s settings has info about your battery usage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZBc9kffXfFCa7gpU87-JlyADATY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858291/IMG_FF5BFD69D52F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Battery” page in your iPhone’s settings has info about your battery usage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Battery Health” page will let you know if you need to replace your battery." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izwvsvS0OzJtaWGbzH0tQT9sZ8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858292/IMG_CB3733A4E40D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Battery Health” page will let you know if you need to replace your battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXkgXj"&gt;If you’ve decided to replace the battery, you have two choices: doing it yourself or hiring someone else — like Apple — to do it. Doing it yourself poses several risks — you void any remaining warranty, and you risk breaking your phone. But if you’d rather do it yourself, there are plenty of guides online, and the process is easier than you might imagine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lvRHsm"&gt;DIY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XajF1B"&gt;For those ready to take on this task, a good place to start is iFixit, which offers very in-depth explainers of how to proceed (for example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B11%2BBattery%2BReplacement%2F127450&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22679492%2Fiphone-apple-battery-replace-ifixit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here is one to use if you own an iPhone 11&lt;/a&gt;). There are also a variety of YouTube videos available that offer step-by-step instructions. The process involves unscrewing the back of the phone, mildly heating the lower edge of the phone, using suction cups to remove the display, and follow several steps to remove and replace the battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0TUywh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Feyqwf3cYtw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LK0fm"&gt;Before you start, you’ll need &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bonafide-HardwareTM-Repair-Driver-Pentalobe/dp/B00XZB3WKQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;smartphone repair tools&lt;/a&gt;, which can cost around $13 (iFixit strongly recommends you add a suction tool called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DottorPod-iSclack-Opening-Apple-iPhones/dp/B07HWLYVQN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iSclack&lt;/a&gt;). Some vendors on Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/IBESTWIN-Replacement-Adhesive-Instruction-Capacity/dp/B07QNXHPP1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even sell iPhone battery replacement kits&lt;/a&gt; for this very purpose, which can run around $25 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1mF24"&gt;Be aware that If you do choose to do it yourself and you have a water resistant phone, your phone will no longer be water resistant after you’ve opened it up. In addition, there’s a good chance that your OS will recognize that there is no longer an Apple-manufactured battery in your phone, which means you may get an occasional warning notice and the Battery Health app won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ulr3WR"&gt;Get Apple to do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dsoHLA"&gt;If you’d rather get someone else to replace the battery and not risk tampering with your device, Apple offers replacements under several conditions, according to&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-power"&gt; its website&lt;/a&gt;. If your iPhone is under warranty or you have AppleCare+ and Apple deems the battery defective, repairs are free. But if the problem is due to some other factor that isn’t covered by AppleCare+ — or if you’re not covered by that or by a warranty — you’ll have to pay a service fee of $49 for an iPhone SE (2nd gen) up to an iPhone 8 Plus, or a $69 fee for more recent models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0eR8A"&gt;You can either ship in your phone for repairs or head to an Apple store. A physical store repair could be completed in one visit or, in more complex cases, take up to three to five days, according to Apple. Shipping it in will take a bit longer, as you need to wait for Apple to send you a box to collect your iPhone. In addition, if your phone is out of warranty, there will be a $6.95 shipping fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIASV4"&gt;If Apple replaces your battery for you, the iPhone should continue to be water resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWVN4X"&gt;If all this doesn’t work for you, your timeline, or your budget, there may also be third-party vendors who offer repair services for iPhones in your local neighborhood. But their quality — and whether they use &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FAnswers%2FView%2F343117%2FWill%2BiPhone%2B7%2Bkeep%2Bit%2527s%2Bwater%2Bresistance%2Bafter%2Brepair&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22679492%2Fiphone-apple-battery-replace-ifixit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sealing adhesive&lt;/a&gt; to maintain water resistance — varies by vendor, so always check reviews and ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdiqei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 2021, 3:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on December 21st, 2017, and has been updated to account for service, device, and OS changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
