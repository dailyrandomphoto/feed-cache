    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Getting something great only costs $50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="R6sqE4"&gt;Looking for a new TV gadget to stream all of your favorite entertainment? Buying an excellent streaming device is easier in 2021 than ever before — and the prices only continue to drop and get more appealing: $50 is the sweet spot if you want a streaming stick or set-top box that can do crisp 4K resolution, Dolby Vision / HDR, and immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound. Each of the picks below has its own strengths, whether it’s a snazzier interface, better voice controls, or a more comprehensive universal search for digging through all of your services. Depending on your wants, there are several good contenders, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the best streaming device for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xj845F"&gt;Pretty much any 4K TV you buy today will come with a batch of built-in streaming apps. But they won’t always have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. (For example, my LG OLED doesn’t have HBO Max.) So a dedicated streaming device is the best way to guarantee you’ll be able to watch that show or movie everyone’s been talking about. You can spend less money on entry-level Roku or Amazon streaming players, but you’ll be better off with one of our recommendations if you want your purchase to last. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="4mn8ET"&gt;BEST STREAMING DEVICES OF 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features and fantastic price of the Chromecast with Google TV make it the best streaming stick for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9cOJvp"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best streaming stick for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3U9Abh"&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the home screen on a streaming stick should look like. That’s really the long and short of why the Chromecast with Google TV has taken the crown of best streaming player. With its new Google TV software, the company has taken a content-first approach that feels more focused and refined than what Amazon and Apple have managed in their own attempts to aggregate popular shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lr5ZDG"&gt;On a Roku or Fire TV, my instinct is always to head right for the app where I want to watch something. But with the Chromecast, I’m equally happy browsing through Google’s rows of recommendations. The Google TV software always clearly shows where content is coming from — you can pick which streaming apps get factored into these recs — and it also provides helpful information (like Rotten Tomatoes ratings) at the surface level when you’re hunting for that night’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XINYdJ"&gt;When you actually hit play, you’re punted over to Netflix or Prime Video or HBO Max just like always, but there’s no avoiding that. In terms of app selection, Google’s got all of the main players covered. You can still cast content to the Chromecast from your phone or laptop, and Google Assistant voice searches consistently work well and showcase Google’s accurate voice recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHgD8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the software on a streaming device should look like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKXPL"&gt;Everything about Google TV feels tasteful, from the fonts to the way the background color subtly shifts to match the artwork of whatever content is highlighted. And the universal Watchlist, which lets you put together a list of stuff you’re interested in from various streaming services, is super convenient — especially since you can add to it from the web or your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUEQwj"&gt;But not everything about the Chromecast with Google TV is perfect. The software can slow down from time to time, and some customers have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/07/chromecast-google-tv-data-corrupt-android-cant-load-error/"&gt;encountered significant bugs&lt;/a&gt; that Google has tried to iron out with software updates. More annoyingly, despite the hardware supporting both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, there are still very popular apps like Disney Plus — which delivers both on other platforms — that aren’t doing so on the Chromecast. HBO Max says it does Atmos, but that hasn’t been my experience. Why? Who knows, but these inconsistencies are a mark against Google. And as for the Watchlist, some services like Netflix have already started removing their shows from it. Again, that’s something Google has no control over, but it does lessen the feature’s usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e1vJvx"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With its easy-to-use software, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is the best streaming device for people looking for a good, simple option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z2csvA"&gt;2. Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hOCseD"&gt;The best streaming device for people who want to keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7O9OD"&gt;It’s hard to really complain about a Roku. The company’s streaming devices are about as simple and straightforward as they come. All of your apps are laid out in a big grid, which can make the experience feel a bit siloed — but there’s no beating that ease of use. And Roku has tried to touch up and modernize the home screen a bit with new sections like “Featured Free” to highlight content you can stream without any subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qjIbaE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGj91j"&gt;Despite some occasional spats with content companies, Roku now has pretty much all of the entertainment you could want, including (most recently) HBO Max and Peacock. And the wonderfully neutral universal search remains one of the best aspects of the platform, favoring your existing subscriptions and free-to-stream options over making you pay money to rent or buy. And the company’s Roku Channel has grown into a legitimate streaming app of its own, offering a mix of ad-sponsored movies, TV shows, and live news for those days when you’re burned out on combing through Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVnPjT"&gt;The $50 Streaming Stick Plus remains the best overall pick among Roku’s hardware when you weigh price and performance. It gives you HDR, Dolby Atmos, and speedy performance. The main thing you’ll miss out on is Dolby Vision. If that’s a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, you should look at the $100 Roku Ultra set-top box instead, which also includes an Ethernet port for optional wired connectivity and a helpful remote finder feature. Plus, the Ultra’s remote has customizable shortcut buttons and a headphone jack so you can listen privately to whatever’s on-screen if you’re trying to keep quiet at night. (Other Rokus let you do the latter with the company’s mobile app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IoeY"&gt;If there’s one area where Roku falls flat, it’s probably voice search. Your voice queries for specific shows or movies should work well enough, but Roku lags Amazon and Google when it comes to natural language interactions. (And forget about using your voice to control smart home gadgets or look up entertainment-related facts.) Still, the company is adding other perks to offset that weakness. Late last year, it added support for Apple’s AirPlay, letting you easily send content from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the TV screen. Speaking of Apple…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple TV 4K, the best streaming device user experience, on a table with the Siri remote." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RvuBLV2eYixMw2JxsRp5Rer4NJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19701522/cwelch_200205_3895_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s more pricey than the competition, but the Apple TV 4K offers a top-notch user experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JRXodl"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWJwP1"&gt;The best streaming device overall experience (for a steep price)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="M2y4K0"&gt;The Apple TV 4K is laughably overpriced compared to its competitors, but Apple’s set-top box still has its own set of appealing qualities. The interface is fantastic. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos across a wide variety of services, has all of the important apps checked off, and also gives you add-ons like Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness Plus (if you pay for them) that you won’t find on other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0yQqy"&gt;Apps sometimes have a higher level of polish on Apple TV and are generally better about taking advantage of everything it can do. Another benefit of the Apple TV is privacy — to some extent. Apple itself isn’t obsessed with tracking your viewing data in the same way that a company like Roku is, but the streaming apps can still see what you’re doing. I generally think consumers aren’t particularly averse to sharing their streaming habits, but Apple’s privacy practices might matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUc2Xv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351704"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7S0fB"&gt;Even with AirPlay now on Roku, the Apple TV still wins out for people deeply invested in Apple’s ecosystem. You can use HomePods as its speakers or connect two sets of AirPods for private listening with audio sharing. You can view the feed from HomeKit security cameras or see who is at the door if you have a HomeKit video doorbell. The Apple TV still makes it easy to tap into content on a Mac in your home, and services like Apple Music and iCloud Photo Library are right there in easy reach on the TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0nOC"&gt;But there’s no forgiving the infamous remote, which is cumbersome to use and too easy to lose. And it’s more difficult than ever to recommend that you spend $180 on hardware that’s now several years old. Doing so isn’t &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;; you’ve just got to know why the Apple TV 4K is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Yh1ylb"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQ6Oml67NEpEL1BJiRk4Z7fw5Iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13360395/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K checks off all the boxes for HDR support and costs just $50, making it the best streaming stick for people in Amazon’s ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6ajwme"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mO4Da0"&gt;The best streaming stick if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iAlxyK"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is yet another popular pick in that $50 range of streaming gadgets. The latest model added support for Dolby Vision, which made it the only product to offer everything HDR (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, HDR10) for such little money — until the new Chromecast came along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HanEXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oDfmk8"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K’s software is similar to the Chromecast in that the home screen takes a content-focused approach instead of just throwing a grid of apps at you. Amazon tends to showcase its own Prime Video content more prominently than shows and movies from other services, but the newly revamped software goes a long way in improving the look and feel of the Fire TV. Alexa voice commands with the remote also work reliably, whether you’re saying “open Netflix” or asking to dim the smart lights in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0rvix"&gt;Amazon offers most major streaming apps, but there are some frustrating omissions: Vudu — a good source of Dolby Vision movies — and Peacock are both still absent from the Fire TV platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i6E5A2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351738"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JiAvz9"&gt;There’s also the $120 Fire TV Cube to consider. It essentially doubles as a streaming device and small smart speaker. Rather than make you press and hold a button to speak to Alexa like with the Stick 4K, the Cube takes a hands-free approach and has beamforming mics that respond to “Alexa” prompts just like an Echo speaker would. It also features something Amazon calls Local Voice Control, which allows it to understand more spoken commands without needing help from the cloud. The Fire TV Cube has a more powerful processor than the Fire TV Stick 4K, making it the fastest of the Fire TV bunch, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pssjk4"&gt;When it comes to their streaming capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube are on equal footing. And you could always put the money you save by going with the Stick toward one of those new sphere-shaped Echo Dots, which will sound far better than the Cube’s tinny built-in speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zkClUu"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia’s Shield TV, the best streaming player for home theater experts and gamers, pictured on a table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dEmAuOHlgj4pGSulYPpS4vSMAlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19324253/DSCF4370.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV is a powerful Android TV streaming box that’s popular with home theater enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qJ9DFz"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ktAsFL"&gt;Best streaming device for home theater enthusiasts and gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bTK5Wu"&gt;Home theater enthusiasts, gamers, and people who like to tinker with their streaming devices have loyally stuck with Nvidia’s Shield TV and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. They can serve as excellent players like any of our other picks, but you can also go more advanced and use them for cloud gaming or set up a Plex media library (in the case of the Pro). GeForce Now and Steam Link probably do more to sell gamers on the Shield lineup versus something like Apple Arcade on the Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="useqbH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmo5EB"&gt;The Nvidia Shields currently run Android TV with Google Assistant built in, but it’s expected they’ll eventually get the same Google TV experience that’s on the Chromecast. Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling can eke out some extra detail from the shows and movies you stream, and I’d rate the included remote control (with backlit buttons, even) as the most ergonomic of them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVfT5g"&gt;But like with the Apple TV, the main hurdle here is the price. The Nvidia Shield TV costs $150, so you’re looking at spending $100 more than devices that offer most of the same functionality. You get Ethernet and a very powerful streaming device for the added premium, and you can push the Shield TV farther and make it do more than just about any of its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sophisticated hackers snuck sleeper malware into nearly 30,000 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="It uses TouchID for biometrics. Overall the hardware is identical to the last model" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6vt3HLWA4Y4aySCbtfWuJFY3b0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68852253/vpavic_4291_20201113_0429.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="avO70x"&gt;There’s a popular stereotype that Apple’s computers are largely immune to malware. Not only is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/12/21134681/mac-pc-virus-malware-malwarebytes"&gt;is that incorrect&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that sophisticated hacker(s) might have been toying with the idea of a heist or drop nasty enough they’d have needed to cover their tracks. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/new-malware-found-on-30000-macs-has-security-pros-stumped/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, security researchers at Malwarebytes and Red Canary discovered a mysterious piece of malware hiding on nearly 30,000 Macs, one designed to deliver an as-yet-unknown payload, and with a self-destruction mechanism that might remove any trace that it ever existed. They’re calling it Silver Sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQyTEK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://redcanary.com/blog/clipping-silver-sparrows-wings/"&gt;Red Canary’s own blog post&lt;/a&gt; goes into more detail, including how they discovered multiple versions targeting not only Intel, but also newer Macs based on Apple’s own M1 chip — which is quite the thing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;given how new Apple’s M1 computers are&lt;/a&gt; and how few vulnerabilities have been discovered yet. It was &lt;a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x62.html"&gt;literally just one week ago&lt;/a&gt; that Objective-See security researcher Patrick Wardle published a story about the first piece of malware discovered in the wild targeting Apple Silicon, and now we have two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EPGdK"&gt;Thankfully, Silver Sparrow was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;able to cover its tracks before being outed, there’s no indication it was used to do any damage, and Red Canary writes that Apple has already revoked the binaries (which should theoretically keep you from accidentally installing it yourself). But the idea damage could have been done isn’t theoretical: they actually found these strains of malware on Macs in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BeOzBK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Given all of this, Silver Sparrow is uniquely positioned to deliver a potentially impactful payload at a moment’s notice, so we wanted to share everything we know with the broader infosec community sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;— Red Canary (@redcanary) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1362558570601058305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJrIqw"&gt;Researchers warn that Apple’s transition from Intel to its own silicon may make it easy for other bad actors to slip malware through the cracks, too: you can read quotes from several of them &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-m1-malware/"&gt;in this &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AhyRCz"&gt;Apple subpoenaed Valve in November as part of its ongoing litigation with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games, and it’s demanding that Valve provide extensive sales data for more than 400 games, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.346.0.pdf"&gt;new filing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/apple-subpoenas-valve-as-part-of-its-legal-battle-with-epic-valve-fights-back/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSU7P8"&gt;The move comes amid Apple’s ongoing fight over Epic’s efforts to avoid paying iOS App Store fees. Apple argues that Valve’s data is necessary to calculate the size of the market of Epic’s “available distribution channels,” as Epic could theoretically offer its games through Steam in addition to other digital marketplaces. But the data is also immensely valuable in assessing the marketplace for games and apps — a space in which Apple’s iOS App Store continues to compete with Valve’s Steam marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNayho"&gt;Valve contends that Apple’s demands are extraordinary and is contesting the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ClS0x"&gt;In one request, Apple calls on Valve to procure documents that show the company’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="P9LoK1"&gt;(a) total yearly sales of apps and in-app products; (b) annual advertising revenues from Steam; (c) annual sales of external products attributable to Steam; (d) annual revenues from Steam; and (e) annual earnings (whether gross or net) from Steam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="L1Vjcl"&gt;Apple argues that this data is “crucial” to help it determine “the total size of the market for Epic’s available digital distribution channels.” The courts have already asked Samsung to provide “almost identical” information, Apple said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="df5Ni3"&gt;In addition, Apple &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; demands that Valve procure documents that show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6Zp6Fl"&gt;(a) the name of each App on Steam; (b) the date range when the App was available on Steam; and (c) the price of the App and any in-app product available on Steam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GWQb3Z"&gt;Valve argues that the requests are overly broad. According to Valve’s position statement in the filing, “Apple gave Valve a list of 436 video games it says are available on the Epic Game Store and Steam, and (a) demanded Valve identify, from 2015 to the present, every version and all digital content or items for each of these games on Steam, then (b) provide exhaustive information about all of them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWZ132"&gt;The requested information includes dates on sale, price changes, gross revenues for “game version and item, broken down individually,” and Valve’s revenues “related to these versions, content and items.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxB5sP"&gt;Valve argues these demands would “impose an extraordinary burden on Valve to query, process and combine a massive amount of to create the documents Apple seeks” and that it does not keep this data as part of the “ordinary course of business.” (The filing also notes that Apple had reduced its request for data from “all 30,000+ games on Steam over ten years” to “436 games over six years.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrLaX"&gt;Valve also argues that “much of what Apple seeks is sales and pricing information for third party games,” but that the company is taking a “shortcut” by subpoenaing Valve instead of getting the information directly from third-party developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMd1qW"&gt;On Wednesday, Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286998/epic-games-apple-european-comission-antitrust-complaint-app-store-fortnite"&gt;filed a formal antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Apple with the European Commission, arguing that Apple has “not just harmed but completely eliminated competition in app distribution and payment processes.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Magic Keyboard is still $100 off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQGSsgTaTgKIdrdk9BGvc6fNh0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68842047/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2WwO3t"&gt;With the right keyboard accessory, you can transform your iPad into a laptop. Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the 11-inch iPad Pro and fourth-generation iPad Air can add a laptop-like experience to either tablet. It includes a set of backlit keys and a trackpad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YprKv7"&gt;At $300, the Magic Keyboard accessory is not cheap, but you can sometimes find it at a much lower price. It is currently going for $199 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Magic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2nd-generation%2F984505060&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LDuKNu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cm7W5h"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new TV for your home, Best Buy has an incredible deal: you can buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728939351250604130" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hisense’s 75-inch 4K LED TV (model H6510G) for only $600&lt;/a&gt;, which is $400 off its usual price of $1,000. The model includes Android TV software built in, four HDMI ports, plus a panel that supports Dolby Vision, HDR 10, and HLG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BUysEF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="As8ore"&gt;Over at Walmart, you can grab a new pair of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-White-Charging-Case-Included%2F245851301%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds for $49&lt;/a&gt; in white. Despite the product being almost three years old, at $49 this is a good alternative for people looking for a decent pair of wireless earbuds without shelling out too much cash. As pointed out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255221/samsung-galaxy-buds-headphones-truly-wireless-review-price-specs-features"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Buds feature a six-hour battery life, a comfortable design, and include better sound isolation compared to Apple’s standard AirPods. The Galaxy Buds also include a company case that supports wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stop your emails from being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHKkuFlkTI9-ornuyWoyTQgbwg8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841883/acastro_190703_1777_pixel_tracking_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmDbQw"&gt;All of those obnoxious marketing emails that crowd your inbox aren’t just pushing a product. They’re also tracking whether you’ve opened the email, when you opened it, and where you were at the time by using software like MailChimp to embed tracking software into the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f75NZ"&gt;How does it work? A single tracking pixel is embedded into the email, usually (but not always) hidden within an image or a link. When the email is opened, code within the pixel sends the info back to the company’s server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYBZIp"&gt;There have been some attempts to restrict the amount of information that can be transmitted this way. For example, since 2014, &lt;a href="https://gmail.googleblog.com/2013/12/images-now-showing.html"&gt;Google has served all images through its own proxy servers&lt;/a&gt;, which could hide your location from at least some tracking applications. And extensions such as &lt;a href="https://uglyemail.com/"&gt;Ugly Email&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelblock/jmpmfcjnflbcoidlgapblgpgbilinlem"&gt;PixelBlock&lt;/a&gt; have been developed to block trackers on Chrome and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6EFgJ"&gt;There is also a simple basic step you can take to avoid trackers: stop your email from automatically loading images since images are where the majority of these pixels hide. You won’t be able to avoid all of the trackers that can hide in your email this way, but you will stop many of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjXsAd"&gt;Here’s how to do it in the major desktop and mobile email apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="91Fgwl"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Gmail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zbqpz9"&gt;Click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to access your settings, and click on “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZEfys0"&gt;In the “General” tab (the first one), scroll down to “Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z0QTtq"&gt;Select “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VeQHzw"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on “Save Changes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="yRek5v"&gt;Note that this will also turn off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282636/amp-gmail-shopping-rsvp-forms-inbox-google-beta"&gt;Gmail’s dynamic email feature&lt;/a&gt;, which makes emails more interactive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading gmail" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rt4n2w6dt0YA29AkQaJs88b8OSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278777/Gmail_settings.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XrhZKY"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Microsoft Outlook (Office 365):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MIRvx9"&gt;Click on “File” &amp;gt; “Options.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="132JwF"&gt;In the “Outlook Options” window, select “Trust Center.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bgp9g6"&gt;Click on the “Trust Center Settings” button. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8dvLox"&gt;Check the boxes labeled “Don’t download pictures automatically in standard HTML messages or RSS items” and “Don’t download pictures in encrypted or signed HTML email messages.” You can make a number of exceptions to the first item if you want by checking the boxes underneath it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Microsoft Outlook " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5oSbMQ9LNmjTkrf0o1boDgulmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278781/outlook_6.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sN1ICl"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Apple Mail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0n9f5S"&gt;Select “Mail” &amp;gt; “Preferences.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A7ND3F"&gt;Click on the “Viewing” tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qwEieV"&gt;Uncheck “Load remote content in messages.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Apple Mail: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3aKO2_n5Ebb00LdepxXPrCAzEn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278801/Apple_Mail_preferences_2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HHDXvZ"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Android Gmail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c5Wulc"&gt;Tap on the three lines in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R8HSTQ"&gt;Scroll down to and select “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KjX4Gw"&gt;Tap on the email account that you want to work with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g1X0ro"&gt;Scroll down to and select “Images.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEYbil"&gt;Tap on “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Android Gmail: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0WEEv9FyZisUtRpDpCK4ZFZ-3Xo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278832/Gmail_a__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Android Gmail: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SIPHfcdjyw0EzWrK6Vq0BMMkdco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278833/Gmail_2__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xbW3d5"&gt;Disable image autoloading in iOS Gmail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eUXclZ"&gt;Open Gmail for iOS, tap the hamburger menu in the upper left, and scroll down to settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dr88Ar"&gt;Tap the account you want to personalize, and tap into “Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xTabJG"&gt;Switch from “Always display external images” to “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lo9CuX"&gt;Note that for those wishing to do this on Gmail’s mobile client, it appears it will only work for personal accounts and not enterprise ones managed through G Suite, for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="M1JF9m"&gt;Disable image autoloading on iOS Mail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MIPm7O"&gt;Tap on “Settings” &amp;gt; “Mail.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8CgUR7"&gt;Find the “Messages” section and toggle off “Load Remote Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading on an iPhone: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8J0Rc6S3VmfrsQIy1rnx9Ne4Fwg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278978/IMG_2A872FA43FDA_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading on an iPhone: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wqH9jGDkO4JBmuzkqV8X-MeiqBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278984/IMG_DFD17EB54AF5_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1Qtvj"&gt;Another option is to use an email client such as &lt;a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks remote images by default; the application allows you to download embedded content on an individual basis or allow pictures from contacts that you trust not to send hidden code in their images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06msoO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 3rd, 2019, 3:47PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include additional information about email clients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbvWNJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 3rd, 2019, 7:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include directions for disabling image autoloading on Gmail for iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Bwbn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 17th, 2021, 5:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instructions for Microsoft Mail have been removed, and a few instructions updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZYqwTfbX2vk4FqDWTzaFfIYSDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/vpavic_200805_4131_0086_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6vCZGK"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16ya9R"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWHEzs"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s coming up on a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people.  While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXvGVa"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then we think the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. It has an excellent camera and good software, though its screen is smaller than a lot of the competition at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHj2r3"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wu38Dv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556638"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2Gej3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="R7dgPY"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s almost a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnYJlm"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4OnLv"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFxDqg"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XX01cV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTqdjy"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBJCKR"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM0nvh"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lIP45s"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PmYbc8"&gt;The best inexpensive Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ndqid1"&gt;If you prefer Android, want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlVUW4"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rrz5GM"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI4c7K"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it. That puts you first in line for Android updates and also guarantees you’ll get them for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkeXFo"&gt;Unfortunately, in a couple of years, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be on its last legs. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlXbHh"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord has very good specs for its price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VceItk"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US, and the company doesn’t plan to sell it in the States. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B grade in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCe0u5"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high refresh rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdWibC"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is strong, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5llXq"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple of selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality, and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t work correctly on US LTE networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even without considering 5G, the Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARB606"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L6XTYh"&gt;A big screen with timely software updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0TPXKd"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G is good for all the reasons that the Pixel 4A is good: it has a great camera, good battery life, and clean Google software. Maybe most importantly, it has a bigger 6.2-inch screen, which is spacious but doesn’t make the phone feel too gigantic. It also uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor, which means it’s faster than the Pixel 4A and nearly all the rest of the sub-$500 Android phones you can find. And there’s support for 5G, of course, which is largely underwhelming in the US right now, but might actually be good toward the end of this phone’s lifespan. It all adds up to a $499 price that’s just under the wire for this category, though the Verizon version, unfortunately, costs $100 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ll5Zxc"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G has a slightly better camera system compared to the Pixel 4A, thanks to the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor. Google has also made its excellent Night Sight mode automatic and improved video with some new stabilization modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0i98AR"&gt;Otherwise, it follows the standard low-cost Pixel formula. It has a plastic back with a fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack. Google doesn’t load down the software with extra crapware you don’t want, but it does include some nice little touches like a voice recorder that automatically creates a transcription as it records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxYa1"&gt;Someday, not having 5G will be a serious downside for smartphones, but that reality is still at least a year or two away. Even if you ignore the potentially faster network speeds, the Pixel 4A 5G is a surprisingly great phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qyzV16"&gt;If you want 5G for the least amount possible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0wGhHB"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;If you can afford to spend a little more, you probably should. A device with better support in the long run will save you some money later. But if budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KnMCx2"&gt;The best phone if you want a big screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="T9fywV"&gt;Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 Android phone may well turn out to be the bestselling phone of 2020. Its predecessor, the Galaxy A50, outshone all expectations. For the A51, Samsung focused on nailing a big screen, good battery life, and the camera. It got the screen just right; the other two are just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJX5CI"&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED display on the A51 is bright and vivid, and you’d have to be pretty persnickety to find fault in it. It doesn’t offer the same high refresh rate you can get on the OnePlus Nord, but it makes up for that with Samsung’s great quality. If there’s one weird thing about the screen, it’s that Samsung put a chrome bezel around the hole punch for the front-facing selfie camera. It’s distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCdhK7"&gt;The A51 sports nice build quality, though you can definitely feel that it’s plastic on the back. It has a headphone jack and 128GB of storage, which is the number you should be aiming for on any phone these days. Battery life should be superb, thanks to a 4,000mAh battery, but because it has to power that big screen, it nets out to being just so-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jy99L8"&gt;As is becoming a (weird) standard on this class of phone, the A51 has a regular wide-angle, an ultrawide, a depth sensor, and a macro camera. And as is also standard, the regular wide-angle will get you the best images. The A51 can’t beat the Pixel 4A for quality, but the different lens options might be more fun for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryPHx5"&gt;Samsung recently committed to providing the A51 with three generations of Android software updates, which is great news. Less great is that it usually takes Samsung longer than you may like to get software updates out to the A-line of phones. Samsung has also started to junk up its previously elegant One UI software interface with ads and other junkware, so be prepared to do some cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNhSDh"&gt;On the whole, though, what the A51 gets you is a very big, very beautiful screen. If that’s your highest priority — and for many people, it is — the A51 is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;If top-notch battery performance is an extremely important feature in your smartphone, then the Moto G Power should be on your shortlist. It’s capable, and you really will get multiple days of battery life on a charge. But if you’re fine getting by on a battery that’s just average, then we think you’ll be happier with a more well-rounded device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly developing magnetic battery pack for iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AtM7sJ_nVFOMcQTgL86zzKsEotU=/0x0:1152x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841695/magsafe_main_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 was announced alongside a range of MagSafe accessories last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GkN3R9"&gt;Apple is reportedly developing a new iPhone charging accessory in the form of a battery pack that magnetically attaches to the rear of the device using MagSafe, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-19/apple-is-working-on-magnetic-battery-pack-attachment-for-iphones"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Although some prototypes have a rubber exterior, the battery pack isn’t thought to act as a protective case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18206642/apple-smart-battery-case-iphone-xs-xr-max-reveiw-test-specs-price-features"&gt;like previous iPhone battery accessories&lt;/a&gt; from Apple. Alongside details of the new battery case, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also notes that the iPhone lineup is unlikely to receive support for reverse wireless charging anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJdoq5"&gt;The battery pack accessory is thought to have been in development for at least a year, but it’s reportedly faced development issues relating to the iPhone’s software thinking that the pack is overheating. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Apple is cautious about announcing charging accessories, after it was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;cancel its AirPower charging mat in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, a year and a half after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16278310/apple-iphone-8-wireless-charging"&gt;it was first announced&lt;/a&gt;. Development problems could mean that the new battery pack accessory is delayed or even scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ro5Cht"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s reportedly faced development issues&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PfV6fm"&gt;The charging pack would be the latest in Apple’s lineup of iPhone 12 MagSafe accessories, which attach onto the back of the phone with the assistance of an embedded circle of magnets. Previous accessories have included wall chargers, as well as magnetically attaching wallets. MagSafe is said to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;returning to Apple’s laptops&lt;/a&gt; as well, only with a connector reminiscent of the old pill-shaped design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joluiK"&gt;Rumors of the new battery pack first emerged after a reference to it was found in code in the iOS 14.5 beta, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/everything-new-ios-14-5-beta-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that the reference has subsequently been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcHjrW"&gt;As well as the new battery pack, Apple is reportedly interested in allowing its devices to charge one another. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that it had planned for its 2019 iPhone lineup to be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/23/18278557/apple-iphone-11-wireless-charging-other-devices-airpods-watch-rumor"&gt;wirelessly charge AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, but the plans were later scrapped. The functionality is “unlikely in the near future,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrqO9g"&gt;Other accessory manufacturers are already attempting to offer similar functionality to the rumored MagSafe battery pack. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/27/21536837/mophie-juice-pack-connect-wireless-battery-qi-charging"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on one such pack late last year, which was being sold on Alibaba and Aliexpress under a variety of names.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly negotiating to build iPads in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fyWgILRvLhswLWuBqeY1XO8bJ1k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68840821/vpavic_190829_3709_1164.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1HWnMS"&gt;Apple is said to be lobbying the Indian government in a move that could see the company manufacture iPads in the country for the first time. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-india-idCAKBN2AI0TL"&gt;Reuters reports&lt;/a&gt; that the government is planning to launch an incentive scheme designed to boost India’s computer exports, and Apple wants in — but is angling for a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6dJlO"&gt;The initiative will have a budget of up to Rs. 70 billion ($964 million) over five years, according to Reuters, but Apple is reportedly asking for that to be almost tripled to Rs. 200 billion. The reason is said to be partly that India’s supply chain doesn’t yet have the scale to meet Apple’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jzy8"&gt;Apple already makes iPhones in India, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17506068/apple-iphone-6s-india-tariffs"&gt;started in 2018&lt;/a&gt; to avoid new import tariffs imposed by the Indian government as part of a “Make in India” initiative. The company has also been seeking to diversify its manufacturing out of China; last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252434/apple-manufacturing-china-vietnam-ipad-india-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that some iPad production would shift to Vietnam this year, which would be the first time major iPad manufacturing happened anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFrJOT"&gt;Two people that spoke to Reuters said it was likely that iPads would be assembled in India by one of its current contractors “as early as this year.” Apple’s partners in India currently include Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV app now available on the latest Google Chromecast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zVOSMThHUPqFqBdRZwA3O_niMzg=/0x0:1569x1046/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68837077/Blog_header.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rB2lJ"&gt;The Apple TV app is now available for Google’s 2020 Chromecast. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178364/google-chromecast-apple-tv-plus-app-2021-announcement"&gt;announced in December&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s streaming app, which offers access to its Apple TV Plus originals, would be coming to the awkwardly named Chromecast with Google TV. Starting today, owners of the excellent $50 device can download Apple TV and start using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlwBpL"&gt;Apple TV originals like &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt; will appear in Google TV’s recommendations and search results. Of note, you’ll also be able to add Apple’s original shows and movies to Google TV’s universal Watchlist. Some bigger streaming services like Netflix have decided against participating in Watchlist in the months since the Chromecast’s release, as they seemingly prefer to keep that sort of functionality inside the app itself. As &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/25/google-tv-netflix-dropped/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in November, the Google TV mobile app doesn’t even include Netflix recommendations anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wU5zHi"&gt;Apple TV is also getting Google Assistant integration on Chromecast; you can start watching any of Apple’s originals with a voice command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQPyiZ"&gt;In addition to being home to Apple’s original programming, the Apple TV app offers easy streaming of your movie / TV show rentals and purchases from Apple. And as on other platforms, any Apple TV Channel add-on subscriptions you might have — CBS All Access, Showtime, etc. — will be available in the app on Chromecast with Google TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO61r8"&gt;Jonathan Zepp, Google’s director of media and entertainment, says that “in addition to Chromecast with Google TV, the Apple TV app will also be available on Google TVs from Sony and TCL.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 12 series is already driving 5G adoption in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vAkeyL_t_xPNV7uq5rUlpNvT38=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832611/cgartenberg_201105_4276_006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $1,099 iPhone 12 Pro Max is currently the top 5G phone in the US, according to research firm M Science.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ArLmxh"&gt;Some new data &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/one-phone-dominates-us-5g-sales-can-you-guess-what-it-is"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-12-pro%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287683%2Fiphone-12-pro-max-5g-sales-adoption" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; Max, 12 Pro, and 12 are already the three top-selling 5G phones in the US. That the phones are just four months old speaks to the continued popularity of the iPhone in the US and just how big of a role it will play in driving 5G adoption in this country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04QSPM"&gt;These reports come from research firm M Science’s sales data and information gathered from Ookla Speedtest users. M Science tracks cumulative sales of 5G phones in the US. This data set includes sales as of the week of January 23rd and notably does not include Galaxy S21-series phones, which hadn’t started shipping at that point. These are third-party reports, so they should be taken with a grain of salt, but M Science’s findings line up with previous reports of &lt;a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/iphone-12-series-launch-review/"&gt;strong 12 Pro Max sales&lt;/a&gt; out of the gate and &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/iphone-12-mini-sales-reportedly-well-below-expectations/"&gt;less-good 12 mini sales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LSPm5E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is responsible for a bit less than half of all mobile phone shipments in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfB53P"&gt;Apple, as it is wont to do, took its time adding 5G to its phones. Samsung started in 2019 with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231384/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-verizon-announcement-specs"&gt;Galaxy S10 5G&lt;/a&gt; and added 5G &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21128230/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-ultra-price-camera-5g-features-video-hands-on"&gt;across its S20 series&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. Outside of those two manufacturers, 5G has trickled down from a once-premium feature into the budget phone class more recently. Despite this growing range of options, adoption has been slow. Since Apple is responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share"&gt;a bit less than half of all mobile phone shipments&lt;/a&gt; in the US, it makes sense that a 5G iPhone would give adoption rates a nudge. So far, that seems to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x21j74"&gt;In the US, 5G’s slow start certainly hasn’t been helped by a less-than-stellar product. While each major carrier offers nationwide 5G coverage, performance is often about the same as 4G — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;sometimes even worse&lt;/a&gt;. That’ll change when more spectrum becomes available to the carriers later this year and into next, but not before a lot of new iPhone 12 owners (unfortunately?) experience 5G for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
