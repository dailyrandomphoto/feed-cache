    <title>Samsung tries to woo iPhone users with a browser-based Galaxy test drive</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y70C9m"&gt;Samsung has released &lt;a href="https://www.itest.nz/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; to give iPhone users “a little taste of Samsung” from their mobile browser. When visited on an iPhone, the site prompts users to add it to their phone’s home screen, after which it turns into a shortcut to a simulated Samsung Galaxy device. The site appears to be the work of Samsung New Zealand, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/samsung-itest-galaxy-device-iphone-experience/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqyLej"&gt;The experience might be limited, but it’s a neatly designed bit of marketing. Open up the camera “app” and a video will automatically play featuring influencer Logan Dodds, who describes Samsung’s camera app features in the interface around him. Poke around the other “apps” in the home screen and Samsung happily markets its phone’s other features and accessories, while text messages and even a fake phone call outline others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8yqhwHjJNLmEPaYlw_596woOS5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431983/IMG_0574.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tooltip from the settings app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SoB9n6iGmuve8gHxjCxLgYflnkg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431982/IMG_0573.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are fake contacts in the message app to text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nCrW3d"&gt;There are also a couple of Easter eggs thrown in if you dig a little deeper. I particularly liked finding the “Friends with kids” contact in the text message app, who sends you garbled nonsense whenever you send them a message. Pry too much into the settings app and you’ll be shown a tooltip that reads, “We’ve simplified the settings menu experience, just so our developer could have a lunch break.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jgXzj"&gt;Samsung is targeting the experience squarely at iPhone users. Try to visit the site with another Android phone and you get a message that says, “You’re on Android already,” while if you try to visit using a desktop browser the site gives you a QR code to scan with your iPhone. Yes, it’s ultimately just a bit of marketing, but it’s more creative than most other smartphone ads out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRwl3z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U12vbn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says iMessage on Android ‘will hurt us more than help us’  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF0be5uHxP1MU1ILYSxxsJAbT9Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69099875/akrales_190513_3338_0008_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBZmZy"&gt;Apple knows that iMessage’s blue bubbles are a big barrier to people switching to Android, which is why the service has never appeared on Google’s mobile operating system. That’s according to depositions and emails from Apple employees, including some high-ranking executives, revealed in &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf"&gt;a court filing&lt;/a&gt; from Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;as part of its legal dispute&lt;/a&gt; with the iPhone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVNGvI"&gt;Epic argues that Apple consciously tries to lock customers into its ecosystem of devices, and that iMessage is one of the key services helping it to do so. It cites comments made by Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddie Cue, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller to support its argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oKuZvO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Three questions that will decide Epic v. Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="32yjX7"&gt;“The #1 most difficult [reason] to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage ... iMessage amounts to serious lock-in,” was how one unnamed former Apple employee put it in an email in 2016, prompting Schiller to respond that, “moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tLvPQo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AWdybq"&gt;“iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” was Federighi’s concern according to the Epic filing. Although workarounds to using iMessage on Android have emerged over the years, none have been particularly convenient or reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pj5gKJ"&gt;According to Epic’s filing, citing Eddie Cue, Apple decided not to develop iMessage for Android as early as 2013, following the launch of the messaging service with iOS 5 in 2011. Cue admits that Apple “could have made a version on Android that worked with iOS” so that “users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly.” Evidently, such a version was never developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwsUJV"&gt;Along with iMessage, Epic cites a series of other Apple services that it argues contribute to lock-in. Notably, these include its video chat service FaceTime, which Steve Jobs announced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOxf9tEXEKQ"&gt;would be an open industry standard&lt;/a&gt; back at WWDC 2010. FaceTime subsequently released across iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but it’s not officially available for any non-Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS2O37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q968OH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three questions that will decide Epic v. Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AU_82ZDjlEZqy_LndGkDcie7DE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096249/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;New filings show both sides’ legal strategies at work&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UzO5Bd"&gt;On May 3rd, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;publisher Epic Games will finally have its day in court, forcing Apple to defend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;kicking &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; last year. Epic’s antitrust lawsuit is bigger than a single game; it’s a direct challenge to the App Store model, the most significant legal challenge Apple has faced since the Xerox days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsUOSQ"&gt;Last night, &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/405/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/407/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;sides&lt;/a&gt; filed a document called a “proposed findings of fact,” essentially laying out every factual claim they’ll rely on in their arguments. The documents run more than 650 pages in total, giving a detailed roadmap of how each side sees the case — from the early days of the iPhone to Epic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493096/epic-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store-court-hearing"&gt;specific preparations for picking this fight with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. But the filings also bring the case into focus, raising three questions that will be central to the trial over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQYdC1"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Fortnite vs Apple: App Store Royale|78038" data-volume-uuid="e322ad1d6" data-volume-id="78038" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-605" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="VW8TJd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the exclusive App Store a necessary part of iOS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="SxoDNd"&gt;The heart of the case is the so-called App Store tax — a 30 percent surcharge Apple collects on purchases made through the App Store. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was kicked off the App Store for dodging that tax by installing its own payment system, which is forbidden under App Store rules. Now, Epic is making the case in court that the rules should never have been put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lRinUq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Legal monopolies and abuses of market power&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W88Sba"&gt;You often hear that this case is about whether the App Store is a monopoly — but Epic’s argument is more subtle than that, drawing on antitrust ideas around legal monopolies and abuses of market power. As Epic sees it, Apple’s monopoly over iOS is legal, but it’s using the market power from that monopoly to dominate the secondary market for app distribution. Epic compares the situation to Microsoft’s antitrust case in the ’90s: a legitimate monopoly over Windows, extended illegally to the secondary market in web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0MXLJ"&gt;It’s a good theory, but it only works if you see the App Store model as fundamentally separate from iOS. In its statement of facts, Apple describes the exclusive App Store as a fundamental part of the iPhone, part of the broader offering that makes the devices valuable. “Apple wanted to ensure that iOS devices were more protected from those malware and instability issues and quality issues that the PC world was used to,” Apple claims in its filing. App Store exclusivity is part of that, but so are security measures like the code-signing and hardware root-of-trust systems. On the software side, there is a range of private APIs and OS-level entitlements that are only enabled after App Store review, tying the systems that much tighter together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Jxu1g"&gt;Of course, it’s inconvenient for this argument that Google is offering a competing mobile operating system with none of these restrictions — to say nothing of Apple’s own macOS, which allows side loading. Clearly, it would be technically possible to allow competing app stores on iOS. The question is whether the court sees that as changing Apple’s business model or changing iOS itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NQj0UK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the iPhone different from a PlayStation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="n8lgwx"&gt;One of the biggest challenges for Epic is that the App Store model is fairly widespread. Consoles like Xbox and PlayStation operate on basically the same playbook, delivering games digitally through an open but curated digital store that’s locked to the hardware and controlled by the manufacturer. That alone doesn’t make it legal, but it adds credence to Apple’s claim that the App Store lockdown isn’t trapping consumers. If you don’t want to play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on an iPhone, you can play it on a console or a PC. Some devices come locked into a specific distribution channel and some don’t, giving users the chance to vote with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PlB1P2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Video game consoles operate under a radically different business model”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DPsUjD"&gt;Epic’s counter to this argument, as explained in the filing, is that “video game consoles operate under a radically different business model than smartphones.” Development for console games is slow and expensive work, and consoles are useless without a steady supply of those games, so console manufacturers are under immense pressure to attract developers. That means hardware itself is often sold at cost, leaving App Store commissions as the primary source of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXDPDw"&gt;Apple is different, Epic argues, because most of its profits still come from iPhone sales. “Developers do not participate in those profits,” the filing argues, “even though the availability of apps contributes greatly to the sale of devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rb70G5"&gt;On some level, this boils down to the argument that console companies are nicer to developers, so their platform power is less of an issue. The constant competition between Xbox and PlayStation gives game developers leverage to extract more favorable terms. But iOS and Android don’t compete for app developers in the same way, and the lower cost of mobile development means the competition happens on vastly different terms. Apple has given people lots of reasons to buy an iPhone, which means there’s less pressure on any given line of business. But that’s well short of the standard for monopoly power, and Apple ultimately comes away from the console comparison looking pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Ig69R4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much control can Apple exert over its hardware?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6ezXaY"&gt;Underneath everything else, Apple is facing a profound question of how much control it can exert over its own devices. For critics, this is Apple’s original sin, using industrial and graphic design to lure customers into a walled garden, then locking the gate. For fans, it’s Apple’s genius, integrating hardware and software to deliver a more purposeful and powerful user experience. But it all rests on Apple’s ability to maintain a closed stack, using hardware integration to control what happens in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMHW0v"&gt;This trial won’t undo that stack, but it could limit what Apple can do with it. The Epic Games fight started over payment processing, but the same legal standard could allow for alternative app stores or limit the restrictions Apple can place on rogue apps like Parler. It’s a first step toward setting regulatory limits on how tech companies operate, similar to the regulations on wireless carriers or banks. At its most basic level, Epic is arguing that Apple’s ecosystem has grown too big and too powerful for it to be run entirely out of Cupertino, and it’s time for it to be directly accountable to antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBIU20"&gt;Hundreds of pages in Apple’s filing are devoted to the benefits of that system for developers and iPhone owners, much of it undeniably true. There really is less malware on iOS devices because of Apple’s software controls, even if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;scam apps sometimes slip through&lt;/a&gt;. The system really does generate a lot of money for iOS developers, many of whom couldn’t compete outside of Apple’s walled garden. The shift to digital distribution really has saved money for developers who don’t need to distribute their product through brick-and-mortar retail anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wcd3uB"&gt;But in a sense, all of that is beside the point. Abuses of market power aren’t excused just because they’re sometimes helpful, and classical monopolies like Standard Oil or Bell Telephone had lots of side benefits, too. The bigger question is whether courts are ready to dive into the mobile software stack and start dictating the terms of how tech companies can set up their marketplaces. That’s a hard question, and it won’t be settled by a single ruling or a single case. But one way or another, it’s a question this court will have to take on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Global chip shortage hits iPad and MacBook production, says report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-mmOHzE302gzu7oYjA3qcwZvYk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093923/DSC01948.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LWGPCr"&gt;Apple has not been spared the effects of the ongoing global component shortage, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/MacBook-and-iPad-production-delayed-as-supply-crunch-hits-Apple"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The publication says that some production of MacBooks and iPads has been delayed, with “a portion of component orders” pushed back to the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORd6Hb"&gt;The issue with MacBooks is said to be related to the ability to mount certain components on circuit boards ahead of the device’s assembly. Delayed iPad production, meanwhile, is apparently because of a shortage of displays and display components. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/why-shortages-of-a-1-chip-sparked-crisis-in-the-global-economy"&gt;Bloomberg reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; on how the squeezed supply of display drivers is causing a bottleneck across the entire tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lgUF4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When will the global chip shortage end so you can finally buy a PS5?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Msa7vE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; didn’t state which MacBook or iPad models would be affected, nor whether the postponed production was for existing devices or yet-to-be-announced updates. Apple is widely expected to launch new versions of the iPad Pro this year, as well as continuing the transition to deploying its own processors across the entire Mac line. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/"&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; that a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Mini LED display would go into mass production this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O13ILA"&gt;iPhone production is said to be unaffected so far, though two sources described component supply as “quite tight.” Nikkei says the shortage “remains a supply chain issue for Apple and has not yet had an impact on product availability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzTFp3"&gt;Related: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chipolo’s new One Spot Bluetooth tracker beats Apple’s AirTags to the punch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIcKFONp23D8j1_YE8vMKmPyj4c=/7x0:1954x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091226/Apple_find_my_network_now_offers_new_third_party_finding_experiences_chipolo_040721_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nbliHC"&gt;The first Bluetooth tracker that can work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;Apple’s vast Find My Bluetooth network&lt;/a&gt; of iPhones, iPads, and Macs is here. But it’s not Apple’s long-anticipated AirTags tracker; it’s the &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/pages/chipolo-one-spot"&gt;Chipolo One Spot&lt;/a&gt;, an updated version of the company’s One tracker that’s designed to exclusively work with Apple’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLu17x"&gt;Chipolo calls the One Spot a “special edition” product. While it has the same 12-month battery life (with replaceable battery), 120dB ring, water resistance, and overall design as the regular One tracker, the One Spot &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works with Apple’s Find My network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9Di4LZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple officially starts letting your iPhone help find lost third-party products","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HscFen"&gt;That’s potentially an upgrade for anyone who already uses Apple products, given that a Bluetooth tracking tag is only as effective as the number of users who are on the same network. And while Chipolo has been around for a while, it’s still far smaller compared to more established players like Tile or the hundreds of millions of Apple devices around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bc0tl"&gt;The One Spot also features some Find My specific functionality, like a “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/use-lost-mode-mmfc0f0165/icloud"&gt;Lost Mode&lt;/a&gt;” that allows users to tag an item as missing — which will, in turn, notify other Find My users if it’s found with a short message and a phone number to help you get your stuff back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5j34u"&gt;It’s a sort of bewildering product, given the context of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;Apple’s rumored AirTags tracker&lt;/a&gt; that’s potentially going to be released later in 2021, and it would similarly be a Find My-exclusive Bluetooth tag for keeping track of lost or missing items. Chipolo’s tracker lacks the rumored Ultra-WideBand radio support that Apple’s tag will reportedly feature for more precise tracking, but that aside, it’s hard to imagine what else Apple’s tag will bring to the table that’s not already available on the One Spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLoWGI"&gt;Preorders for the Chipolo One Spot will start in May, with shipping planned for the beginning of June. No price has been announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k5oMWW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22372016%2Fapple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is officially opening up&lt;/a&gt; its Find My tracking network to third-party companies (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;as it had promised last year&lt;/a&gt;.) Now, any hardware manufacturer can add software-side support for Apple’s localized network to track missing items — so long as they play by Apple’s Made for iPhone (MFi) accessory rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3KKTk"&gt;The first wave of items that can now be tracked starting today include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof’s S3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22162936/vanmoof-x3-long-term-review"&gt;X3 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;Belkin’s SoundForm Freedom True Wireless Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, and the Chipolo One Spot tracking tag — all of which can now rely on Apple’s crowdsourced Bluetooth network (which encompasses millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oBlSj"&gt;Users will be able to add those devices to the updated Find My app starting today and can track them through that app much in the same way that they’d track any missing Apple product. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRWl47qcc_MooRKhCYbIzv0ePy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427260/Apple_find_my_network_now_offers_new_third_party_finding_experiences_chipolo_040721_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chipolo’s Find My-compatible One Spot tracker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HAu2KR"&gt;Apple says that third-party devices looking to add support will have to apply through the company’s MFi program for authorized accessories and “adhere to all the privacy protections of the Find My network that Apple customers rely on.” Approved products will sport a new “Works with Apple Find My” badge to let customers know that they’re compatible with Apple’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oc3g2t"&gt;Additionally, Apple announced that it’d be offering a chipset specification for third-party hardware companies to integrate with the Ultra-Wideband systems in Apple’s more recent phones for even more precise tracking in the future. Apple has also long been rumored to be working on its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529927/apple-airtags-location-tracker-find-my-accessory-patent-applications-posture"&gt;AirTags product&lt;/a&gt;, which would offer similar UWB-based tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKEozp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jon Stewart’s Apple TV Plus show will debut this fall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Late Show with Stephen Colbert..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NcrQ2qvtXJUOI1zSbaGRSYkS14k=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089773/1150560659.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9KIamC"&gt;Jon Stewart is heading back to TV with a new Apple TV Plus show, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, which will debut this fall, Apple announced on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yso27H"&gt;“‘The Problem with Jon Stewart’ is a multiple season, one-hour, single-issue series which will explore topics that are currently part of the national conversation and his advocacy work,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-reveals-series-title-for-jon-stewarts-highly-anticipated-return-to-television-as-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-to-debut-in-fall-2021-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22371914%2Fjon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Each season of the series will be further explored in a companion podcast to continue the discussion.” Apple didn’t specify how many episodes will be included in each season or how many seasons the show will run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmjsb0"&gt;The iPhone maker says this is the first project of a multiyear partnership with the popular political commentator, so it sounds like we could see more shows with Stewart’s involvement on Apple TV Plus in the future. Apple has also signed a first-look deal with Stewart and his production company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFQf5Q"&gt;Apple first announced the show was in development &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"&gt;last October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt; marks Stewart’s return to TV, following the end of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, which wrapped in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kcSLEQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jon Stewart will return to TV with an Apple TV Plus series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade finally got the boost it needed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNbAP2eGnJ4kxD39kEkqb8vSygk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088559/opening2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoZQ7K"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad"&gt;Apple Arcade received its biggest update since launching back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. More than 30 titles were added to the subscription service, including much-anticipated games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362624/fantasian-release-date-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;Hironobu Sakaguchi’s roleplaying epic &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But while the quantity and quality of titles added were impressive, the most important part of the announcement was a change in direction. Among those big-name exclusives were a number of classics, ranging from &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/em&gt; to chess to &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;, that help round out the service. Apple Arcade has finally matured into something close to a Netflix for mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="xRwD9v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432584"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKXwLy"&gt;Since the beginning, the pitch for Apple Arcade has been entirely centered on quality. While the App Store continues to devolve into a space dominated by free-to-play games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman"&gt;Arcade provided an alternative&lt;/a&gt; where some of the most talented developers in the world could create great mobile games without having to worry about monetization. It launched alongside new games from the likes of Zach Gage and Ustwo, and it has continued to add titles on a near-weekly basis. Subscribers get all of those games for a flat monthly fee. It’s been a solid service — but it’s always felt like something was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91717B"&gt;When you sign up for something like Netflix, it might be because of one of the service’s big exclusive titles like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;. But that won’t necessarily keep you hooked. Part of what makes Netflix so compelling is &lt;em&gt;everything else&lt;/em&gt;, from reality shows to classic sitcoms, that give you something to watch after you’re done with the big tent poles. Frequently, these aren’t traditional exclusives: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297077/the-office-friends-peacock-hbo-max-streaming-wars-disney-plus-star"&gt;think of how important &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; have become in the age of streaming TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1gxGs"&gt;Those kinds of experiences are something Apple Arcade didn’t really have before this shift. Now, though, when you’re done playing a short narrative game like, say, &lt;em&gt;Creaks&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Assemble With Care&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a lot more to keep you invested with recent additions like &lt;em&gt;Good Sudoku&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EjgYix6_JhkfSAb-fHIf2BxEsqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425030/01_Welcome.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonderbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kM6Tyn"&gt;Even better, while many of these games are available on other platforms or through the App Store, the Arcade versions are generally improved because they feature no form of in-app purchases or monetization. You won’t find puzzle or card games saddled with ads or have to open loot boxes in &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K21&lt;/em&gt;. There’s even &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Legends&lt;/em&gt; — essentially a character-collecting gacha game — which almost feels strange to play without being prodded to spend money. (This lack of microtransactions makes Arcade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164414/apple-arcade-family-kids-crossy-road-butter-royale-loud-house-netflix"&gt;a very family-friendly service&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ayy0Rw"&gt;It’s also important to note that this change in strategy is additive. Apple has introduced two new categories to Arcade — one for older App Store hits, another for classic games like chess or solitaire — but it’s still releasing those big exclusive titles. In addition to &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, last week’s update included &lt;em&gt;Wonderbox&lt;/em&gt; (think &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; for younger players), &lt;em&gt;World of Demons&lt;/em&gt; (the latest action game from PlatinumGames, the team behind &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bayonetta&lt;/em&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin: Pop Tap Beat&lt;/em&gt; (a new entry in an excellent long-running rhythm game series). It’s a great and diverse lineup of experiences; sometimes scrolling through games on Arcade can feel like heading into an alternate reality version of what mobile gaming could have been if the race to free-to-play never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAVEO8"&gt;Obviously, none of this is a guarantee of success. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308657/apple-arcade-canceling-games-subscription-service-engagement"&gt;if previous reports are to be believed&lt;/a&gt;, the shift appears to be a result of Arcade’s inability to keep subscribers hooked. While the subscription model is now dominant for the music, film, and television industries, it’s still relatively nascent for games. Outside of Xbox Game Pass, there hasn’t been a major success to date. Apple Arcade arguably faces a greater challenge being on mobile, where users have long been conditioned to expect games for free. The Netflix of games still feels inevitable, even if we’re not there yet — but Arcade feels closer than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Series 6 Watch is down to $320 at Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A new Apple Watch watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQYXnAB0Y0lkOH4SSRPYFNxjxhM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69083354/vpavic_200929_4216_0171.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OYnGU6"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can save $80 on the Apple Watch Series 6. Normally $400, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 40mm model with GPS for only $320 if you buy the wearable in red&lt;/a&gt;. The sale price on the product listing notes $385, but the retailer will knock an additional $65 off that price at checkout to bring it down to $320. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yssRql"&gt;The Series 6 is currently the flagship watch by Apple and features an always-on display in addition to new sensors that allow users to keep tabs on their blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dyKFO4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IV8gv8"&gt;If you are looking to buy Apple’s most affordable iPad, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737008739520232562#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has a deal on the 128GB storage model, which you can buy for only $380&lt;/a&gt; — $50 off its usual retail price of $430. This iPad model includes a 10.2-inch display, an A12 Bionic processor, a Smart Connector to connect to a Smart Keyboard, and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3b6LRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431710"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5fNuD9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers &lt;/em&gt;is a sequel to the critically acclaimed JRPG game &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with gameplay similar to the &lt;em&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/em&gt; franchise. If you are looking to buy the game on either &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737009243776759335#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737010170367657302#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt;, Best Buy has knocked $20 off its usual retail price, bringing it down to its lowest price yet of $40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdU617"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yy8cIC"&gt;PlayStation Plus is an online subscription service that allows both PS4 and PS5 owners to play games (that are not normally free to play) online. But the service also includes some other incentives, including regular discounts on the PlayStation Store, access to free games each month, and, if you have a PS5, access to the PlayStation Plus Collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhnEpJ"&gt;If you are looking to renew your membership, Eneba is offering a deal to readers of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; based in the US. From now until April 11th, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals04062021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership for $27&lt;/a&gt; when you enter code &lt;strong&gt;APRILVERGE &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="vSzAlX"&gt;The Apple TV 4K hasn’t been updated for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;more than three and a half years&lt;/a&gt;, which is an eternity in technology. But &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/05/tvos-14-5-beta-code-suggests-120hz-support-coming-to-a-new-apple-tv-model/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the new tvOS 14.5 beta references support for 120Hz refresh rates — a capability that no currently available Apple TV models have — which could indicate Apple is working on a new version of its set-top box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFM1DX"&gt;While it’s not clear what Apple may use a 120Hz refresh rate for in a new Apple TV, one of the more intriguing possibilities is for smoother gaming, like what’s offered with 120Hz support on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Apple has been showing increased interest in gaming as of late, so it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if the new Apple TV had more gaming-focused features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni0cS9"&gt;For example, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad"&gt;just added&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of new games to its Apple Arcade gaming subscription service, which lets you play games on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV and carry your progress across platforms. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;the iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/macos-big-sur-113-adds-fixes-for-ios-apps-on-desktop-support-for-ps5-and-xsx-pads"&gt;macOS 11.3&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1612241720"&gt;tvOS 14.5 betas&lt;/a&gt; also all include support for the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller and the Xbox Series X controller — presumably, that support will carry over to the final software releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3a7Zc"&gt;The rumored 120Hz support for Apple TV would also line up with a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from December&lt;/a&gt;, which said Apple was working on a new Apple TV for sometime this year with a “stronger gaming focus.” (That report also said the new set-top box would have a redesigned remote, which will hopefully be easier to use.) While we don’t know exactly when Apple will announce this rumored device, or if it will announce it at all, if you’re in the market for a new Apple TV, you might want to wait just a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
