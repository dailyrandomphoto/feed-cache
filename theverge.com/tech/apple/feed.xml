    <title>How the M1-powered iPad Pro compares to other iPad models</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kk2fuz1qoN65Gtr9IWma5nu9h8U=/3x0:977x649/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69162095/ipad_pro_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oYWndI"&gt;Apple has announced the next generation of its iPad Pro line. But most of the biggest changes for Apple’s flagship tablet are largely on the inside. The latest iPad Pros feature a new eight-core M1 processor; the same chip featured in the most recent model refreshes for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;newly announced iMac&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIw2yY"&gt;Like last year, the iPad Pro comes in two sizes: 11 inches and 12.9 inches. The 12.9-inch model this year also includes a new Mini-LED screen, which Apple is branding as a “Liquid Retina XDR” display. The iPad Pro 2021 refreshes also include support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB 4, in addition to 5G connectivity. Both iPad Pros also feature a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that can automatically track you during video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7V3r5T"&gt;Of course, specs don’t always tell how much has changed between model refreshes. And it can be easy to presume, at first glance, that not much has changed — especially if you own a 2020 iPad Pro. If you want to see how both iPad Pro models with the M1 chip compare to the other three iPads Apple currently sells, along with the 2020 Pro models, take a look at the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Any video conferencing app can use the iPad Pro’s fancy zoom and pan camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WzipxLaS7ueC_Y9xzx7EXXkc9IQ=/0x26:600x426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161443/Center_stage_ipad.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Pro’s front-facing camera can digitally pan and tilt to track video conference participants.&lt;/em&gt; | Video: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mFm6sw"&gt;Apple has confirmed that the digital pan and zoom feature of the new M1 iPad Pro’s front-facing camera can work with any video conferencing app, not just FaceTime. That opens the door for popular apps like Zoom and Microsoft Teams to make remote work and e-learning blend more seamlessly into the realities of pandemic life — a hybrid lifestyle that’s likely to continue even after the outbreak subsides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHdkaS"&gt;Center Stage, as Apple brands it, keeps video conferencing participants properly framed even as they move about a room by combining machine learning with a fixed 12-megapixel sensor touting an ultra-wide 122‑degree field of view. We’ve seen similar tracking on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871173/facebook-portal-camera-price-release-date-availability"&gt;Portal TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;, and even the Xbox Kinect accessory. But those are niche devices compared to the iPad, which saw sales surge last year as students and remote workers snapped the tablets up in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDTFsN"&gt;“Center Stage works with FaceTime and other video conferencing apps,” says Apple on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395325%2Fipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro landing page&lt;/a&gt;. Apple missed its chance to scale FaceTime to compete with the likes of Zoom and Teams by reneging on its promise to make it an industry standard in favor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;ecosytem lock-in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m2tpdGV2oDI6nPCbtkc4DhWyros=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459122/lcimg_b1916176_0880_4bb5_9b1c_bfaee6cd2f4d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultra-wide front-facing camera is still located at the “top” of the new iPad Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UQG24u"&gt;Apple demonstrated Center Stage with two participants, both of whom are recognized and framed appropriately as they move about a kitchen, on a FaceTime call with a third. It’s a good demo; the COVID-19 pandemic has blended work and life so hard that it’s now fairly common to see people making dinner during a Zoom meeting across international time zones, or a kid asking for a parent’s help during a Teams school lesson. Tech like Center Stage can help further infuse this sense of humanity into our otherwise stoic professional and educational pursuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuwYuF"&gt;Unfortunately, the position of the front-facing camera, unchanged on the new M1 iPad Pro, makes participants appear to be staring off to the side when used with a keyboard dock, as is common for business and school uses. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;iPadOS creates other frustrations&lt;/a&gt; for video conferences. Hopefully the iPad Pro is just a start and we’ll see ultra-wide Center Stage cameras coming to the much maligned, but better positioned, MacBook webcams soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching the most egregious scams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RiP7jjgMFJRfUbjrdRBS5eHQf_Y=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161392/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A one-man Bunco Squad is poking holes in Apple’s App Store image&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qQn2RS"&gt;Recently, I reached out to the most profitable company in the world to ask a series of basic questions. I wanted to understand: how is a single man making the entire Apple App Store review team look silly? Particularly now that Apple’s in the fight of its life, both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;in the courts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378697/apple-witness-senate-judiciary-hearing-antitrust-app-stores"&gt;in Congress later today&lt;/a&gt;, to prove its App Store is a well-run system that keeps users safe instead of a monopoly that needs to be broken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnxRWd"&gt;That man’s name is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou"&gt;Kosta Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt;, and over the past few months, he’s made a convincing case that Apple is either uninterested or incompetent at stopping multimillion-dollar scams in its own App Store. He’s repeatedly found scam apps that prey on ordinary iPhone and iPad owners by luring them into a “free trial” of an app with seemingly thousands of fake 5-star reviews, only to charge them outrageous sums of money for a recurring subscription that many don’t understand how to cancel. “It’s a situation that most communities are blind to because of how Apple is essentially brainwashing people into believing the App Store is a trusted place,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOIPmq"&gt;There’s a lot to unpack there: fake free trials, fake reviews, subscription awareness. We could write an entire story about each. Today, I’d like to focus on how one guy could find what Apple’s $64-billion-a-year App Store apparently cannot, because the answer is remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lYDL7A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Can it really be this easy?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zwzUSt"&gt;You simply look at the apps that are making the most money. Then, you find ones where the user reviews are suspicious and look for ridiculously high subscription prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHzVUl"&gt;That’s it. There’s no step four. Eleftheriou tells us this is how he started finding these scams, but you don’t need to be a coder to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJ0ZZh"&gt;Heck, let’s try it together right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mT5Gf8"&gt;While Apple doesn’t share “top grossing” charts for the App Store any more (that seems to have died with the introduction of iOS 11 in 2017), companies like SensorTower still publicly share that data. All you have to do is pick an app category — &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/rankings/top/iphone/us/business?date=2021-04-15"&gt;say, Business&lt;/a&gt; — and click through the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5ukZd"&gt;Here’s “&lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/us/appitate-llc/app/call-recorder-icall/1447098963/overview"&gt;Call Recorder iCall&lt;/a&gt;,” the #26 top-grossing app in the Business category on the day I checked. As you can see below, “Charlier Brown” says he’s 100 percent satisfied and there’s a 3-day free trial, so what do we have to lose other than... &lt;em&gt;$9.99 a week?&lt;/em&gt; Hooo boy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rESiNvMmQvBR9xF-Tv31PWBlrz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453912/icall_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Charlier Brown” thinks you’ll like this call recorder app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pdxBfX"&gt;Users of the app tend to complain they can’t figure out how to cancel that $520 a year  subscription — and that the app often stops recording after just a handful of seconds. Yet somehow it’s got a 4.5-star rating on the App Store. And fake reviews clearly have something to do with it. Here are a few &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/US/publisher/app/appName/1447098963/review-history?selected_tab=reviews"&gt;that app data firm SensorTower recently archived&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BVUdpL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No real downside&lt;/strong&gt; by Leena Hayes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2E8hgU"&gt;The app is free and is very versatile. Obviously if you are more into working out it may not be the best (there are high lv’s so it can be difficult) but for what it offers you it’s fantastic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89XJAI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best at home at I’ve found&lt;/strong&gt; by Darren Gorham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezVce8"&gt;Ive tried various at home apps to use in between the gym and none of them are as easy to use. The workouts are effective and I love the tracking it provides along with caloric counts and timing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xM0gc5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No equipment needed&lt;/strong&gt; by Rosalba Noble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J70tk8"&gt;If you want to feel better about yourself &amp;amp; not join a gym, highly recommend this app as it gets you motivated to bigger as in more reps - not weights. I think its great to use your own body weight to get that burning workout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nnHDKv"&gt;Call Recorder iCall is clearly not an exercise app, but that doesn’t seem to have stopped these “reviewers” from trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xw0eN9"&gt;Now, let’s try the #8 top-grossing app in the Utilities category: “&lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/us/tv-cast-co-ltd/app/roku-remote-control-roki/1481938145/"&gt;Roku Remote Control - Roki&lt;/a&gt;,” which seems a little suspicious when you consider that Roku gives away &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roku-official-remote-control/id482066631"&gt;its own official remote control app&lt;/a&gt; for free. Here are a few choice one-star reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RxbZZW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking my money&lt;/strong&gt; by 804user&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdhrE0"&gt;I paid for the $19.99, but I am still being charged each month and still have yet to hear back from any type of customer SERVICE....BEWARE!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7qpoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Didn’t work&lt;/strong&gt; by lawstudent1989&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHtwze"&gt;And now I can’t cancel my subscription in the app it and I’m worried it’s just a farce to get my credit card info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9bAAE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not impressed&lt;/strong&gt; by FallenWish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVIzy7"&gt;So originally I had this app on my android and it was free but now we have to pay for it?Like we don’t already dole out 300 dollars or more for the tvs   ‍♀️There is just no winning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="f0PrJV"&gt;And here’s the first screen you’ll see after downloading:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fndrSL7Q0saqUf7aNYqGgnEJFM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453914/roki_subscription.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Roku remote looks like such a good deal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TMkewI"&gt;How could an app like this possibly have a 4.5-star rating in the App Store? Well, it wouldn’t if you actually averaged out each written review: Apple’s “4.5” counts every disembodied rating where someone punched in a number of stars, even if that was just to dismiss an annoying pop-up so they could try the app. As Eleftheriou tells me (pointing to his tweet, which I’ve embedded below), Roki would have had a rating of just 1.7 stars if you only counted reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yJSncF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Out of 15,000 ratings, only 338 reviews! And their average?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.7 stars&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ONE. POINT. SEVEN.&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1360146173340704775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14eOzT"&gt;Here’s the kicker: Eleftheriou called out this app’s behavior &lt;em&gt;two months ago&lt;/em&gt;, and yet &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1481938145?l=en"&gt;it still exists in the App Store today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear why, but it brings me to another important point. Even when people point out these shady apps, Apple doesn’t necessarily take action — and as Eleftheriou pointed out to me during our conversation, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has some direct experience there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3URwfR"&gt;On February 8th, we brought a bunch of these scams to Apple’s attention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;with this story&lt;/a&gt;, which prominently embedded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938981866860550"&gt;a tweet by Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; about another scammy app called “&lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/US/dragon-game-studio/app/star-gazer/1474038335/overview"&gt;Star Gazer+&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4j60ea"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;4.6 stars, with over 80,000 ratings, and a glowing 5-star "featured" review: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Aup1ehYTdk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Aup1ehYTdk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938981866860550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qCB7ma"&gt;Apple didn’t remove that app for two whole months, and won’t tell us the reasons for the delay. On the record, Apple would only provide this statement for our story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y6rze1"&gt;“We designed and built the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for our users, and are constantly improving our processes to reduce fraud, malware and spam. To provide our users with the best experience, we regularly reject and remove apps, as well as fraudulent ratings and reviews, resulting in millions of removals every year. We intend to keep at this important work to ensure users can confidently download the apps they love and developers continue to make the App Store a great business opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jxbpnQ"&gt;Star Gazer+ finally disappeared on April 8th, after Apple was approached by another journalist &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2021/04/07/apple-iphone-ipad-app-store-scam-warning-new-iphone-problem/?sh=7231e8a960aa"&gt;who publicly asked why it was taking so long&lt;/a&gt;. (It also happened to be the day Epic Games drew attention to some of these scams in a legal filing, though we’re not sure either is the true reason.) And while it appears that its publisher Dragon Game Studio has been booted off the App Store in the process, Apple appears to have overlooked its &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; publisher account &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/publisher/publisher/631073615"&gt;for co-founder Jonas Johnsson&lt;/a&gt;, whose current claim to fame — no joke — is a “Ghost Detector+” with a $5/week recurring subscription fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qam2H9"&gt;Johnsson’s also got &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/horoscope/id1273077875"&gt;an $8/week horoscope app&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m sorry, this juxtaposition of angry reviews and a 4.5 score makes me laugh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YALilJ9VUTMVQajkcbSkuvP9qKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453915/Clipboard01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seems like a bit of a mismatch here, Apple?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wVq2ga"&gt;While it’s impossible for us to tell how many of the horoscope app’s 32,000 star-only ratings are fake, Eleftheriou says Apple should have no problem with that. “When you consider refund request rates, app usage, and other associated info that only Apple has, you could imagine a totally revamped discovery system that does away with the current crude star-rating system that hasn’t seen any innovation since Bezos pioneered it 20 years ago,” he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99ZpZ8"&gt;During my hunt for scam apps, I also notice that some reviewers of these shady apps complain that developers are asking them for money a second time, even though they already purchased full premium access, and Eleftheriou says it sadly appears to be a theme: “A lot of scammers go and buy successful apps from people, and all they need to do is take that skeleton, make minor modifications and make a lot of money,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu8vQN"&gt;To get a sense of just how much money these scams are bilking out of people, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263766331494402"&gt;here are some comparisons&lt;/a&gt; Eleftheriou made when he spotted a VPN app scam last week, one that Apple was remarkably quick to shut down (after myself and a number of other journalists reached out to Apple about the painfully obvious scam):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GOSyil"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To give you an idea, that’s more recurring revenue than apps like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Microsoft Word&lt;br&gt;- Microsoft OneDrive&lt;br&gt;- Google Drive&lt;br&gt;- Washington Post&lt;br&gt;- Fox News&lt;br&gt;- Reddit&lt;br&gt;- Bloomberg&lt;br&gt;- NBC Sports&lt;br&gt;- Grand Theft Auto&lt;br&gt;- NBA LIVE&lt;br&gt;- Monopoly&lt;br&gt;- DocuSign&lt;br&gt;- Udemy&lt;br&gt;- LastPass&lt;br&gt;- GoPro&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263766331494402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSbuHf"&gt;But it’s only “quick” if you ignore that Apple didn’t stop the scammers for six whole months, even though they caught the &lt;em&gt;exact same developer&lt;/em&gt; doing the &lt;em&gt;exact same thing &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263777865846787"&gt;months before&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="237PTA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It gets worse. This developer is a repeat offender inside Apple’s “walled garden”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They had *another* VPN scam that netted them over half a MILLION dollars before it was shutdown early 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now knowing Apple’s lack of punishment they’re even more brazen &amp;amp; more profitable. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R99l9Rn21u"&gt;pic.twitter.com/R99l9Rn21u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263777865846787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VznQX9"&gt;You would think Apple would keep these off the App Store, right? And if not then it would at least root them out, catch the scam artists, and keep them from doing it again. Yet that doesn’t seem to be happening. While Apple currently makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;an estimated $64 billion a year from its App Store&lt;/a&gt; and tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it has computer automation, proprietary review tools, huge volumes of internal data, and a dedicated “Discovery Fraud team” of humans at its disposal, a single person on a laptop in his living room is finding egregious scams that Apple continues to host, and I was able to use his basic technique to do the same thing. As Apple faces down hearings in Congress and lawsuits in court, its argument that it needs to maintain total control over the iPhone app ecosystem to keep users safe doesn’t mesh with the obvious examples of grift that anyone can easily find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxDzim"&gt;Here’s another scam Eleftheriou spotted (I highly recommend this whole thread):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="75urnh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You think the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; is “a place you can trust”?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Think again! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to spot a $5M/year scam, in 5 minutes flat: &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1381463196280610816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6rk0YT"&gt;And another:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cdx7sV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I don't know what's worse about this app:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- “Translated” fake reviews&lt;br&gt;- “Recommended by Apple” popups in Safari&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kq5lRrKCWc"&gt;https://t.co/Kq5lRrKCWc&lt;/a&gt; contact email&lt;br&gt;- Blank website, registered in India&lt;br&gt;- $9.99/week subscription&lt;br&gt;- Grossing $1M (!) a month&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is Apple even doing?? &lt;a href="https://t.co/5oUBCJ2GNh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5oUBCJ2GNh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1379682377304211457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s8pjCr"&gt;And another. (If you find some, too, Eleftheriou would love to hear from you at bunco.squad@hey.com.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zAHGv8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So once again, Apple took down another app I exposed but is cool with the developer running their other, even *more* profitable scam. I'm speechless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below you see "Live Wallpaper Z", allowed to keep stealing $40k/month from unsuspecting people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do I know?  &lt;a href="https://t.co/KkehMixic8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KkehMixic8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357446762949054464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ubGJ3M"&gt;Eleftheriou tells me that Apple has removed over 100 apps due to his reports — and if you’re wondering whether his online crusade is personal, the answer is most definitely yes. He began digging for scams after his own app FlickType, a keyboard for Apple Watch, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011082075148291"&gt;was overtaken by scam apps that didn’t work and charged ludicrous fees&lt;/a&gt;, yet prospered due to fake reviews. What’s more, he claims Apple gave his competitors (and scammers) a leg up by refusing to initially approve his app — because Apple was hoping to acquire it from him at a cheap price instead. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he filed a lawsuit against Apple&lt;/a&gt; for two years of lost revenue and other damages. So he’s absolutely got skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdQ4IV"&gt;But I don’t think that lessens the impact of his Twitter threads about where, precisely, Apple’s App Store is falling down on the job. The fake review situation seems bad. So do the difficult-to-cancel recurring subscriptions. While I like to think most &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers will see the fine print and know how to cancel, and Apple’s been getting better about mandated warnings, the bewildered reviews on these apps are a sign that many iPhone and iPad users are still having trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mhph4"&gt;Eleftheriou suggests to me that the kind of users who might be most vulnerable to these scams are experiencing a kind of perfect storm: “They get virus pop-ups in Safari, they’re directed to the App Store and think the app is recommended by Apple, they download the app thinking it’ll help them, it’s got the perfect ratings, and they’re not savvy enough to know.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cs9uOD"&gt;He shares a chart with me (from &lt;a href="https://appfigures.com/"&gt;AppFigures&lt;/a&gt;, see below) about how long it can take for vulnerable users to turn off recurring subscriptions: “Only half will have figured out how to cancel it two months later. The other half still hasn’t figured it out after 8 whole weekly billing cycles,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3JMtrtvtCzjrtE4NikKBOpM4qo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22454671/QTKjQiuW.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chart by AppFigures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;“Only half will have figured out how to cancel it two months later.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JYCDB0"&gt;Situations like these make it harder than ever for Apple to justify its constant rhetoric about how the App Store is safe, secure, and defended, or that it’s necessary for Apple to be solely in charge, something that has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647249/wwdc-apple-parental-control-app-store-mdm-spotify-moderation-developers-2019"&gt;already been in question&lt;/a&gt; for years due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;the company’s arbitrary enforcement of its rules&lt;/a&gt; and recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;App Store cash grabs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tQevDt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7HZ4dh"&gt;And we’re starting to hear from Apple insiders, too, that the company’s claims about App Store security are overblown. Eric Friedman, the head of the company’s Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk (FEAR) team, will be testifying in next month’s Epic Games trial. In a recent deposition he spoke of the App Review team as “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight” and “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog.” His team reportedly believed App Review’s job was incentivized to get apps “through the pipe” and “move people through” like TSA employees. “App Reviewers typically review between 50 to 100 apps per day,” reads part of Epic Games’ filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61G2Bb"&gt;Other App Store executives deposed for the Epic Games trial admitted that they were aware of a number of the types of scams we’re discussing today, including ringtone apps that reportedly raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars a month despite users warning against them — &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf"&gt;start at page 170 here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; for examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pv1LNy"&gt;“Apple likes to tie the App Store together with the system level protections, and bundle them together as the reason why the distribution is secure, but really it’s the system-level protections that are doing all the work,” says Eleftheriou. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slU8nz"&gt;Meanwhile, Apple former senior director of worldwide marketing (and noted tech analyst) Michael Gartenberg praised Eleftheriou’s recent efforts to highlight scams, suggesting that the Apple ecosystem is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gartenberg/status/1383122033588985856"&gt;“breaking at the seams.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="owr4Jb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I believe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@keleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; has brought an important issue about the App Store to a mainstream audience. I hope Apple gets its act together soon. The ecosystem that is often praised is breaking at the seams IMHO&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Gartenberg (@Gartenberg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gartenberg/status/1383122033588985856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gloOn0"&gt;But the thing I’m stuck on is how the most profitable company in the world, a company that has long justified a 30-percent cut of the App Store’s billions because of its App Review efforts, a company with multiple enforcement teams and access to internal data, isn’t doing the simple task of auditing the App Store’s top-grossing apps for fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGV82N"&gt;It’s not a novel idea: &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/12/03/barnard-game-app-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;’s John Gruber suggested it in December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and again &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1169078580703375361"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and again &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/09/widgetsmith_bunco_squad"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="WF8q98"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They don’t have to look through them all. Even if that were possible it’d be stupid. All they have to do is police the most popular ones. If they simply looked at the top charts and scanned for scams they’d find most of them.&lt;/p&gt;— John Gruber (@gruber) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1310634858499190792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mRxkda"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapp-store%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22385859%2Fapple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;though Apple claims&lt;/a&gt; “the apps we offer are held to the highest standards for privacy, security, and content,” and that “moderators review worldwide App Store charts for quality and accuracy” every single day, it doesn’t seem to have taken this simple step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMLMpL"&gt;Apple would not tell me why one man is continuing to find egregious apps that Apple’s fraud and app review teams are missing, or whether it goes back to inspect the App Store’s most lucrative apps for fraud. The company would not say how it protects customers against fake reviews, or whether any customers that fell for these scams will get refunds, or how it plans to combat scams in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGefny"&gt;Apple did say generically that it does offer &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084"&gt;the ability to &lt;em&gt;request&lt;/em&gt; refunds&lt;/a&gt;; that it does re-review apps against its App Store guidelines; and that it has improved its subscription processes both by 1) requiring app developers to clearly display what customers are getting into and how to cancel, and 2) prompting users to “manage” their subscription at the time they delete an app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2NWfIg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I repeat my request from last year: the App Store needs a bunco squad — a team that hunts for and is empowered to take action against scammy apps. And ban repeat offenders. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nGpZeALUdw"&gt;https://t.co/nGpZeALUdw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Gruber (@gruber) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1169078580703375361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 4, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYUNiw"&gt;By the way: you know that app that John Gruber helped draw attention to in 2019, the one that reportedly charged $10 every week for wallpaper you could find free online? &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/background-beautiful-photos/id1171036231"&gt;It’s still on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Never got removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Rh0Nwo"&gt;It currently has a 4.1 rating, despite countless negative reviews, and &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/US/tron-apps-inc/app/background-beautiful-photos/1171036231/overview"&gt;SensorTower estimates&lt;/a&gt; the app still makes its developer $10,000 a month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech announces cheaper Magic Keyboard alternative for new iPad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cIhR5Hfs7KeT1zVyy3kYGUa0DJI=/0x1:1497x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161192/lct.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="efHctY"&gt;Apple just announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;M1-powered update to the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and Logitech has followed up with a new keyboard and trackpad accessory for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch models. The Combo Touch is a case with a Microsoft Surface-style kickstand and a detachable backlit keyboard with a trackpad. It connects over the iPad Pro’s Smart Connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSDFxZ"&gt;Logitech already released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231088/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-keyboard-trackpad-case-review-price-specs-features"&gt;similar Combo Touch keyboard for 10.2-inch and 10.5-inch iPads&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a related &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Ffolio-touch.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395219%2Flogitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Folio Touch&lt;/a&gt; for the 11-inch iPad Pro and 10.9-inch iPad Air. The Folio Touch’s keyboard isn’t detachable and its trackpad is a little smaller than the new Combo Touch, but otherwise it’s a comparable product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKbpM07pVTlgcVfm02zqpYAPk0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459035/lct2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d5nEia"&gt;This is the first time Logitech has offered a keyboard/trackpad option for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, however, and it’s significantly cheaper than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple’s own Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. The 11-inch model is $199.99 and the 12.9-inch model is $229.99 versus the $299 and $349 that Apple charges, meaning you could save about $100 or more on the sticker prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX4sJC"&gt;You might actually prefer Logitech’s design, as well. It’s not as sleek as the Magic Keyboard, but the case will offer better protection for the iPad, the detachability and kickstand offers an extra degree of versatility, and the keyboard has a useful function row. The 11-inch model is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Fcombo-touch-ipad.920-010095.html%3Fcrid%3D1762%23buy-combo-touch-ipad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395219%2Flogitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to pre-order now&lt;/a&gt;, while the 12.9-inch version is listed as “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hs4Xss"&gt;After what feels like ages of rumors, speculation, and worry that I was getting way too obsessed with a Bluetooth item tracker that seemed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/2/17924312/tile-mate-pro-premium-subscription-launch-battery-range-price"&gt;similar to ones&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date"&gt; other companies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;AirTags are finally here&lt;/a&gt;. But before you preorder the Mentos-esque pucks, there’s something you should be aware of: if you want to engrave your AirTags, you can’t combine a horse and poop emoji in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20rRSu"&gt;That’s right, the emoji version of “horseshit” is a no-go when getting an engraving for Apple’s newest product. Here’s what happens when you try to make that your engraving of choice:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NutL9CXqgO33Uqx7XCe7_CRxh-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458423/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_4.48.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says no to “horseshit” in emoji form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QMOxcH"&gt;Curiously, poop and then horse (“shit horse”) is totally fine, though. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q1Uymr65Ow6aJYNmaOZraMUcD6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458224/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_3.20.01_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has no problem with “shit horse”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JxnslX"&gt;Fictional horse excrement is fair game too. Despite being a horn away from being exactly the same emoji, “unicorn shit” works fine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6JUfeJdQV-RlelRmLeRZXEqBfg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458484/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_5.27.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is more forgiving of fictional horses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AMOJ6R"&gt;As do emoji representations I tried for “snake shit,” “monkey shit,” “chicken shit,” and even “shit bird.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="93hkSZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10457217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86gPs9"&gt;Similar limitations apply to actual offensive words as well. Apple gives you &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough letters for some creative diction, but catches some of the obvious offenders. “SUCK,” “NSFW,” and “BUTT” are still on the table though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjKJne"&gt;This is all very silly on some level, but consistent with the conservative California Dad lens through which Apple seems to make most of its product decisions. The same emoji restrictions are present on AirPods and iPad engravings, for example. Though on those devices, “horseshit” does seem to work — so if you really want to brand your AirPods case that way, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mabrO7"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple to see if these limitations are deliberate or a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who knew Tim Apple was a professional thief?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jCEFnGDhoGu_YcMPvSjC4NS90rs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69160236/tim_cook_spy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ca3vDl"&gt;Tim Cook, the mild-mannered Apple CEO, probably didn’t have to lift more than a finger to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394227/apple-ipad-pro-2021-how-where-to-buy-preorder-link"&gt;a new line of iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; with the company’s Arm-based M1 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlFWXE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254958/tim-cook-apple-trump-username-changed-twitter-name-potus-president"&gt;Tim Apple&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand? He’s the kind of daring superspy who can pull off a high-security heist, slicing through plate glass, rappelling down buildings, and dodging lasers, all with a trusty grappling hook at his side — as you’ll see in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYlMcEJK9MWmfi8-NurEkdWKq_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458419/tim_apple_cook_mission_impossible_4.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0cOS2X"&gt;Also, he’s apparently able to &lt;em&gt;unsocket&lt;/em&gt; a soldered-down chip, perhaps the most impressive trick of all — except perhaps for the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974999/trump-is-lying-about-the-new-apple-factory"&gt;where he gave Donald Trump a “new” factory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241646/apple-tim-cook-gave-the-first-mac-pro-to-trump"&gt;the “first” Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; off its assembly line. Not bad for a 60-year-old, even one who’s in charge of the most profitable company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3KzH0"&gt;I sure hope he’s ready for the memes! Here’s one single GIF with everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYC-sV9f26gLYdwC4ya5f937KLY=/821x0:2261x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159412/airtag_accessories_header_202104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afQCgp"&gt;The Apple AirTags &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;have finally been announced&lt;/a&gt;, and with them come a ton of accessories to make them easier to use (so much easier than if it had, say, a built-in way to attach it to things). While a small tracking puck could be carried in a bag, there are a variety of other things that you may want to put an AirTag on that require some sort of holder or the judicious use of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aibtVD"&gt;These are all the accessories we could find that are either listed for preorder on the maker’s site or have a page on Apple’s store. We don’t have official ship dates for most of them, but it’s probably a safe bet that the ones on the Apple Store will become available when the AirTags do, on April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zukTwfmRIxQklWUdl7oFS7ls-Ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457924/HNPX2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belkin’s AirTag holder. Tie it to anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pAbwNc"&gt;Belkin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RWmQC6"&gt;Belkin currently has two offerings, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPR2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPX2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-strap%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a strap&lt;/a&gt;, which both sell for $12.95. Both products have a circular holder for the AirTag and come in white, black, blue, and pink. They’re currently listed as unavailable in Apple’s online store and as “coming soon” on Belkin’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACO1OVMfOG9bRTqGaMafFuiVKRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457922/7245bb43_16cd_47d2_9cb4_94bc7f177b9a.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I genuinely love this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lTlcNk"&gt;Nomad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="678fYv"&gt;Nomad also offers its take on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-leather-keychain&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a keychain&lt;/a&gt;, but (characteristically) its version is a leather pouch that encases the AirTag. The company also has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-glasses-strap&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a glasses strap&lt;/a&gt;, which acts both as a strap to keep your glasses handy and as an AirTag holder in case you manage to misplace them. Both are listed for $39.95 but are marked down to $29.95 if you preorder, which you are able to do now on Nomad’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spigen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spigen’s rugged AirTag case. Maybe you could attach it to your rock climbing gear?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XGObNE"&gt;Cyrill / Spigen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IwxThP"&gt;Cyrill is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.cyrill.com/collections/airtag/products/black-airtag?variant=36909671776414"&gt;vegan leather keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; in two colors, black and “stone” (which is a light gray). It costs $19.99 and seems to be available now. Spigen, Cyrill’s parent company, is also offering its own AirTag cases: a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-valentinus%3Fvariant%3D32709738725423&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-rugged-armor%3Fvariant%3D32709737971759&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a ruggedized case&lt;/a&gt; with a hefty clip connector (and what appears to be a bottle opener, though it’s not listed as a feature). Both are $24.99 — the keychain is available to order today, and the rugged case is available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAOJkLEdPjYmgkJgBM3cysqxx9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457912/MX852.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the bag charm. I dare you to put it on a Gucci or Louis purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kuvoxz"&gt;Hermès&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5fM4hd"&gt;Apple has a history with Hermès; the French luxury company made some jaw-droppingly expensive Apple Watch bands. True to form, the Apple Store lists a leather &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX872AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX8A2AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-luggage-tag%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;luggage tag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX862AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-bag-charm%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bag charm&lt;/a&gt; made by Hermès — costing $349, $449, and $299 respectively. It is worth noting, though, that the accessories do include an AirTag with a custom “Hermès” engraving, so you can flex while you find. The key ring and bag charm come in orange, brown, and what looks like black but is listed as “bleu indigo.” The luggage tag is currently only shown in brown. Like Belkin’s offerings, they are currently unavailable through the Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple forgot to revolutionize the Magic Mouse’s infamous charging port</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_H3Aff0QEFsuLJU19YnTZ4K1AP8=/231x0:2639x1605/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159997/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_2.11.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the new Magic Mouse colors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kX4Lxl"&gt;Apple revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;a redesigned iMac and Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;its “Spring Loaded” event&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, but didn’t, for some reason, decide to change the Magic Mouse 2’s infamous charging solution. While the mouse will come in new colors to match the new iMacs, Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its charging port is still on the bottom — meaning that five and a half years after its introduction, Apple still seems to think that the best way to charge the mouse is by flipping it over (rendering it useless) and plugging in a Lightning cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmjxDi"&gt;The Magic Mouse’s charging situation has long been a bit of a joke — my former colleague Nick Statt equated it to looking like “a beetle with its legs in the air” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse"&gt;all the way back in December 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and frankly, I’m having a hard time coming up with a better description.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JY7mfNejfVDbX486GvNIzYAolMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9833361/Apple_Magic_Mouse_Bad_Design_2.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Mouse 2, charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2oB2Xr"&gt;Why didn’t Apple didn’t take the opportunity to change things up alongside the new iMac and Magic Keyboard? The company made obvious and good improvements to both of those products. Why not tweak the Magic Mouse’s design to have, say, a charging port in the front? That’s how wired / wireless mice have done it for years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;including our favorite gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woB3ta"&gt;There is some hope that Apple is willing to dump bad design, though. The first Apple Pencil had a similarly meme-worthy charging solution that required you to plug it directly into a iPad’s Lightning port, but Apple fixed that years later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18023772/new-apple-pencil-2-2018-ipad-stylus-price-release-date"&gt;with the Apple Pencil 2&lt;/a&gt; by letting it wirelessly charge off the side of iPads that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H29froDJmJ7jGd02m_Yr6TsF07M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13358115/Apple_Pencil_Bad_Design.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old Apple Pencil, charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p46ecz"&gt;And Apple finally responded to complaints about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300891/apple-tv-siri-remote-touchpad-button-design-form-function"&gt;frustratingly finicky&lt;/a&gt; touchpad on the Apple TV’s remote today by unveiling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394196/apple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons"&gt;the new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which has a scroll wheel and a clickpad. I’m crossing my fingers Apple will update the Magic Mouse next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will now let you buy an M1 Mac Mini with 10-gigabit networking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIff1-czpgmAu09IH-jKzuHA-cU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159929/cwelch_201114_4292_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z1igo4"&gt;The M1-powered Mac Mini &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394631%2Fapple-m1-silicon-mac-mini-intel-networking-10gb-ethernet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can now be configured&lt;/a&gt; to included 10-gigabit networking, an option that the computer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;notably missing compared to its Intel-powered counterpart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/20/apple-silently-updates-m1-mac-mini-with-optional-10-gigabit-ethernet-port/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The update to the 2020 computer seems to have come during Apple’s store update that came with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;bigger product announcements today&lt;/a&gt;, including a new iMac and iPad Pros. Adding the faster networking will add $100 to the price of the computer — the same price as if you were to add 10Gbps to the Intel version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="expeBB"&gt;When Apple added the 10Gbps port as an option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18097117/apple-mac-mini-2018-review-upgrade-faster-more-powerful-features-price"&gt;the Mac Mini in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, it was welcomed by those running home and professional servers, as well as anyone who needed fast network access from a cheaper Mac (like video professionals using network-attached storage). But when Apple introduced a faster version of the computer with its own custom chip, the ability to add networking faster than the standard Gigabit Ethernet was no longer there. If the lack of 10Gb networking took the (as of now) least expensive M1 computer out of the running for you, it’s now an option again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NI1UyM"&gt;You can order the Apple Silicon Mac Mini with faster networking today, but it may be a bit of a wait for the configuration — Apple estimates that I could have a stock M1 Mac Mini shipped to me in two days, but adding the 10Gb ethernet turns that into two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You may have to actually pay for Apple TV Plus to watch Ted Lasso’s second season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B1EptwL5tAw0vo1N4La88skGlJI=/108x0:1280x781/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159678/ted_lasso.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkJGBf"&gt;Apple TV Plus launched on November 1st, 2019, but odds are that you (along with almost two-thirds of other Apple TV Plus customers) aren’t actually paying for it, thanks to Apple’s lengthy free trials. But Apple may have finally found the carrot to convince people to actually shell out their hard-earned cash for another streaming service: the upcoming second season of sleeper hit &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which is set to debut on TV Plus on July 23rd — just after Apple’s free subscriptions for its earliest customers end on July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bfKm3"&gt;It’s no secret that Apple TV Plus has a paying subscriber problem: as of January, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-freeloader-problem-percent-free-1234890385/"&gt;research firm MoffettNathanson noted&lt;/a&gt; that approximately 62 percent of TV Plus subscribers are enjoying Apple’s free ride. The free trials for the service were originally intended to last a year, but Apple has kept extending them — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;first to February&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233276/apple-free-tv-plus-service-trials-extended"&gt;and then to July&lt;/a&gt;. The company still offers a free year for new customers, but July 1st will be the day that anyone who signed up at or shortly after launch runs out of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="joZ5Oh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple TV Plus is still looking for its big win","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21262291/apple-tv-plus-morning-show-licensed-movies-netflix-disney-plus-quibi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wINydT"&gt;Apple has been trying to grow TV Plus into a hit, but some of its highest-profile shows (like &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt;) failed to be the big, breakout hits that Apple was hoping for. And the ongoing extensions of the free trial period have started to feel like Apple was fishing for a big enough hit to hook customers into signing up — and somehow, it seems that the wildly popular &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; might be it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ow2nfS"&gt;The first season of the show (which is based on a series of Jason Sudeikis commercials) debuted quietly last summer, but the charming cast, heartfelt storytelling, and sheer optimism of the series have resonated with fans in the past several months. It’s also won Apple some of its streaming service’s most prestigious awards, including a Golden Globe for Sudeikis’ role as the titular coach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQv0wd"&gt;The show is by far the biggest hit for Apple’s service, which makes the upcoming second season Apple’s best shot for hooking subscribers. That’s especially true since &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season will offer 12 episodes, which could guarantee several months of customers given Apple’s weekly releases — enough, perhaps, for Apple to get subscribers on board with another big marquee show like &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295512/apple-tv-plus-foundation-show-trailer-isaac-asimov-wwdc-2020"&gt;its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; adaptation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
