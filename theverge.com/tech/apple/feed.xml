    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A standing desk with a tangle of cables&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tDOzAR"&gt;There are a lot of topics, both serious and fun, that are out there to be covered by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it falls on our news writers to cover them: from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/coronavirus"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/space"&gt;space exploration&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22337007/matpat-game-theory-10-year-anniversary-youtube-interview-gaming"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;Super Nintendo World&lt;/a&gt;. Mitchell Clark is one of those writers; among other articles, he wrote one of the best explanations you can find of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;what exactly NFTs are&lt;/a&gt;. We took a look (remotely via photos) of Mitchell’s desk and asked him some questions about his stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYQo9n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at The Verge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhnlnH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310104/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox"&gt;Like Jay, I’m a news writer&lt;/a&gt;, tasked with keeping &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s readers up to date with news about pretty much anything you could think of. Lately, it’s been a lot of NFTs, but it’s really just a grab bag every day I come into work, which keeps it exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNhGWr"&gt;I also literally just got here — I started in December. I previously did a little of everything, from slinging fast-food chicken fingers, professionally fixing people’s phone problems, and doing training, testing, and coding for software the government uses. Basically, pretty much anything not related to my degree in video production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EF91IsdPbOTFBN5WP7q2vD4ltQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22390076/mclark_210311_4470_0022.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Er8AyX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wI5mbB"&gt;I live in a relatively small and cheap city, so I’m luxuriating in a two-bedroom apartment. I’ve worked at home ever since we moved here in 2017, so as soon as we got all the moving boxes out of the second room, I claimed it as my office. As for where the desk is: it used to be up against the window, but the sun kept getting in my eyes, so I moved it against the wall instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnyXAC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nhx3iJ"&gt;It’s called the &lt;a href="https://www.imovr.com/imovr-energize-standing-desk-workstation.html"&gt;iMovR Energize&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a motorized standing desk. And yes, I do actually work standing up a lot. I don’t often work sitting at it, though — the cat is banned from the office, but if I’m in here he’ll sit outside the door and scream. So if I’m going to work sitting down, I do it on the couch so he doesn’t guilt-trip me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CVwlK"&gt;Half of the reason why I chose the Energize was because it’s ostensibly made in the US, and the other half is that there are almost no reviews of it, and I wanted to do one and have it stand out. As far as I can tell, I’m still the only person who’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wiuu9C5iMYw"&gt;done a video review of it on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, the TL;DR of which is that it’s a good desk. If it lasts for 10 years, it may actually be worth the almost $1,000 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="p0FWIp"&gt;
&lt;div id="vnv1dg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401527" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="U4sroo"&gt;
&lt;p id="z4sx47"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that’s the simplest desk chair I’ve seen so far.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBlWLO"&gt;Yeahhhh, it’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Ftrollberget-sit-stand-support-glose-black-60388258%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339963%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-mitchell-clark-macbook-shure" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Ikea Trollberget&lt;/a&gt;. I went with it over an office chair in the optimistic hope that it would help me not slouch so much. The seat part of it tilts back and forth, so it really requires some core strength to sit up straight, which is great when I actually do that, but honestly I usually just put my elbows on the desk and curve my body into some horrible “S” shape. If I lived somewhere I could find a used Herman Miller, I’d probably give one of those a try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7R21kK5RdrkxXTuoaiZ764SWj9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376751/mclark_210311_4470_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q2RyiT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a bit about your audio setup. It looks like you’ve put considerable thought into it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji4EC7"&gt;Yes, I have. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Supercardioid-Condenser-Microphone-Applications/dp/B0002BACBO?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shure Beta 87A&lt;/a&gt; microphone, mounted on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heil-Sound-PL-2T-Overhead-Broadcast/dp/B000SZVZ74?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Heil PL2T arm&lt;/a&gt; and connected to a Focusrite Scarlett 2i4 audio interface. The headphones are the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FDT770pro80--beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-80-ohm-closed-back-studio-mixing-headphones&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339963%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-mitchell-clark-macbook-shure" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro 80 ohms&lt;/a&gt;, which aren’t super fun for music (hence the fifth-gen iPod with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/KZ-ES4-Balanced-Technology-Earphones/dp/B07D57F1RK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;KZ ES4 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;) but are great for accurately reproducing vocals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpZSEa"&gt;The whole setup is optimized for one thing: making sure that my voice is as clear and echo-free as possible. I was tired of having to go into a cave of blankets to record voiceovers, so I got a microphone with a very narrow (supercardioid) pickup pattern, and it works great. I also sometimes use it as an improvised video mic, for which it’s only okay. Usually, it just makes me sound really great on Zoom calls (and lets me pretend I’m going to make more episodes of a podcast I made three episodes of and then gave up on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EgkG2Q"&gt;
&lt;div id="qpkPur"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401995" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UlnhHC"&gt;
&lt;p id="cooLyE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your other tech: your computer, display setup, and other tech stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfeGSO"&gt;Alright! My computer is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch M1 Macbook Pro&lt;/a&gt; — I went with the Pro over the Air mainly for the brighter screen. When I’m working from my desk and not the couch, I plonk that on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-Laptops-MacBooks-ergonomic/dp/B07377XVNY?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Twelve South Curve stand&lt;/a&gt;, and plug it in to a… *checks B&amp;amp;H order history* &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1090259-REG%2Fdell_u2415_24_ultrasharp_led_monitor.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339963%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-mitchell-clark-macbook-shure" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell U2415 24-inch monitor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F783KC"&gt;It’s 16:10, which is nice, but unfortunately it’s got a 1920 x 1200 resolution. I seem to be especially sensitive to low resolutions (I can immediately tell the difference between YouTube at 1080p and 720p on my &lt;em&gt;iPhone Mini&lt;/em&gt;), so my next big upgrade may be to LG’s 24-inch UltraFine 4K (if I can find one used).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpH7Dq"&gt;I switch between a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Trackpad-Wireless-Rechargable/dp/B016QO5YWC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Magic Trackpad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G502-Performance-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07GBZ4Q68/ref=sr_1_2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt; for my mousing needs. Changing which device and hand I use helps stave off wrist pain, and I’ve discovered that any mouse without Logitech’s ratcheting / free-spinning scroll wheel is almost unusable for me. For my keyboard, I use the peculiarly named &lt;a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;amp;p=3732"&gt;Ducky One 2&lt;/a&gt; with Cherry MX Browns. The main theme is wired: I’ve always run into weird, annoying issues with Bluetooth keyboards and mice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPENuQ"&gt;The final Big Thing on my desk is an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1071815-REG%2Fowc_other_world_computing_owctb2ivkit0gb_thunderbay_iv.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339963%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-mitchell-clark-macbook-shure" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OWC ThunderBay 4&lt;/a&gt;. Being into video production and photography (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body/dp/B07H3Y9CJY?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fujifilm X-T3&lt;/a&gt; for digital, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F3"&gt;Nikon F3HP&lt;/a&gt; for film, by the way), I accumulate a lot of absolutely&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;massive files: I’ve currently got 11TB of data spread out across 17TB of drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kWDylL"&gt;
&lt;div id="gnOXMp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221788" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zJUyPX"&gt;
&lt;p id="orCBuk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned that you had a bit of a cable issue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhqQos"&gt;Yeah, I just up (down? side-to-side?)-graded from an iMac Pro, which had just enough ports to plug in my five bajillion peripherals. Now my computer has two ports, so I have an absolute nightmare of a situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGLShM"&gt;Here’s my current setup: I connect my laptop with Thunderbolt to the ThunderBay 4. Somehow that provides enough power to trickle-charge the laptop, and provides a Thunderbolt pass-through, which I currently have a USB-C &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Aluminum-Type-C-Clamp-Reader/dp/B078853NCS/ref=asc_df_B078859974/?tag=&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=309779531175&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=7357722852296212524&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9033789&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-431341047288&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;adgrpid=62412137260&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Satechi Clamp Hub Pro&lt;/a&gt; plugged into. Plugged into &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; are my mouse and keyboard, and my monitor’s built-in USB hub, which has even more devices plugged into it (notably the scanner and Scarlett). Then I use my laptop’s second Thunderbolt port to plug in the monitor (good thing the ThunderBay can charge the computer, I’m out of ports).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnRcei8vz886eWNtykb-7uXUpRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22390077/mclark_210311_4470_0024.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="soK6sR"&gt;I’ve got an &lt;a href="https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt-dock"&gt;OWC Thunderbolt 4 Dock&lt;/a&gt; on preorder to save me from this triple-hub chain nightmare, but until then, I’ve just got a mess of wires and am hoping nothing breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzNNez"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see your keyboard is right near your desk. Do you ever take a break to make some music?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pF5Tvn"&gt;I can’t actually play piano to be honest, even though I’ve literally had this keyboard since I was seven years old. I do have it hooked up to my computer through the Scarlett’s MIDI interface, so sometimes if I find a really cool-sounding synth in Logic, I’ll mash at the keyboard until I get something that sounds good. Its main job, though, is to sit there, guilting me until I actually learn even a drop of music theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3dsen"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looks like a great setup for storing your bikes, but I’d be nervous about crashing into them if I push my chair back too hard…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYsewR"&gt;I’d never even thought about that, but thankfully my chair doesn’t have wheels so I’d really have to try for it. The biggest risk with the bikes is that I’ll look out my window, see the paved trail that runs right outside it (and keeps going for 100 miles into a different state), and not be able to resist the temptation to take a ride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFLCvy"&gt;For any other apartment-dwellers, the bike stand is probably a great option: it’s made by a company called Delta Design. I bought mine at Costco, but as always when I find something I like there, it’s no longer available. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Delta-Cycle-Home-Michelangelo/dp/B08PL2K4RG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon still sells it&lt;/a&gt;, and REI &lt;a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;amp;website_id=0f9b0f6f-13ac-4498-8e0f-b3beae765e07&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F884870%2Fdelta-cycle-michelangelo-rugged-2-bike-gravity-rack&amp;amp;ctc=VergeWOYDMitchellClark03222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has a nicer-looking version&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RI7KZi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a bit about your decorations: the great collection you’ve got on your bulletin board, the sculptures on your windowsill, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADQcPi"&gt;I always want to have things that, as Marie Kondo would put it, spark joy around me while I’m working. So, I try to decorate with things made by creators or friends, or with art that is associated with some sort of memory. Some of the pins are from webcomics or podcasts that I enjoy, some are from Etsy, and the vintage and Michigan-related ones I got from my grandma, who apparently collected them. I’m on the record as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1352770201314447360?s=20"&gt;absolutely loving &lt;em&gt;Kentucky Route Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so I figured I’d get a poster of it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qw6orj"&gt;The coolest story, though, goes with the metal bonsai trees. I did karate for about 10 years (and have missed doing it for six), and my sensei had a friend who would make the trees by hand. He’d give them out every year as awards for people who exemplified certain qualities of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dj%C5%8D_kun#Interpretations"&gt;Shotokan dojo kun&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t remember which I got them for, but they’re good reminders of some pretty good rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LJDWf9tINegala4OHe-NwqaL-Y4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376761/mclark_210311_4470_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RU0tInTcpSsVo4dKKvO_yCKLyZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376754/mclark_210311_4470_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCKjdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s on the shelving beneath the bulletin board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fA13a5"&gt;A little bit of everything! There’s an Epson Perfection V550 scanner, which I use for everything from the mundane (scanning documents and birthday / holiday cards) to the exciting only to me (scanning all the film negatives I’ve developed). I also keep all my camera gear there, with one of the drawers having a mishmash of GoPro accessories, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Lightweight-Microphone-Integrated-Shockmount/dp/B00GQDORA4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rode VideoMic Go&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zoom-H5-Four-Track-Portable-Recorder/dp/B00KCXMBES?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom H5&lt;/a&gt;, and other video gear. The other drawer has “ancient media” like VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and vinyl records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ist68X"&gt;Oh, and there’s a label maker, which I’m pretty sure doesn’t have any tape left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCrnTU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally — do you often hide under your desk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUUqaE"&gt;Only in the summer, when it’s hot and I need to get out of the sunlight! But I do work from the floor a lot, either just sitting on it or laying down. I’ve been told it’s weird (usually by my wife, who comes home and finds me laying on the floor, with the cat having sprawled himself across my legs), but it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob6Ibn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQXlbe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="mN8Z0R"&gt;Valve is launching a dedicated Steam Link app for macOS this week. The app allows Steam users to stream games from a PC to devices with the Steam Link app installed. While the Steam macOS app has offered streaming already, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/steam-link-launching-on-mac/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that this lightweight Steam Link app is just 30MB in size &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/steam-link/id1246969117?l=en"&gt;from the Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt; compared to the full Steam app, which requires 1GB of storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pq9e4o"&gt;Steam Link will be useful on Macs, particularly as it’s rare to see big AAA games debut on macOS. Mac users typically have to dual boot Windows, use virtualization apps, or Steam games from a PC to get access to most of the latest titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPLbj9"&gt;Steam Link launching on macOS follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22310321/valve-steam-linux-steam-link-remote-play-together-account"&gt;Linux version of the app earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, and it now means Steam Link is available on macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi. All you need to do is download the Steam Link app, pair your device with a compatible controller, and connect to a PC over your local network to stream PC games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltkQPz"&gt;Valve also rolled out a big update to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20924545/steam-remote-play-together-beta-valve-online-co-op-local-multiplayer"&gt;Remote Play Together feature&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, allowing Steam users to stream local multiplayer games with friends over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 20-year head of developer relations retires ahead of Epic App Store trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dodo6jd71U9-4Kr_0-CM10-WKt8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69007782/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgylad"&gt;Twenty years ago, Apple CEO Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/160968/amp"&gt;poached Ron Okamoto away from Adobe&lt;/a&gt; to become vice president of developer relations and later help build the App Store. Now, we’re learning he has retired — less than a couple months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341511/apple-epic-trial-tim-cook-tim-sweeney-craig-federighi-phil-schiller-mark-rein-testify"&gt;before Apple’s App Store is set to go on trial&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DQmgd"&gt;The eagle-eyed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-s-longtime-app-store-developer-relations-chief-retires?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Mark Gurman at&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; that not only was Okamoto listed as a potential witness in that trial, but that &lt;a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20518642/2021-03-19-apple-tentative-initial-witness-list.pdf"&gt;court documents describe him&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; VP of worldwide developer relations, not the current one. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting that he’s been replaced by Susan Prescott, a product marketing exec who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8744943/apple-wwdc-2015-female-executive-on-stage"&gt;started becoming one of the public faces of the company&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MwApg"&gt;Okamoto’s still set to be deposed in the trial, but perhaps for less than an hour. He’ll seemingly be testifying about the App Store’s policies, business model, how it compares to developing for macOS, and the “transformation of the application software business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D385I6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Angry MacBook owners get class action status for butterfly keyboard suit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple has updated the options on the function row" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TcEZHNRHyTP-6dgttIU6jdb3xJE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69006345/vpavic_4291_20201113_0428.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PqEMwp"&gt;A judge has &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.326502/gov.uscourts.cand.326502.306.2.pdf"&gt;certified a class action suit&lt;/a&gt; against Apple for its fragile butterfly keyboard design. The suit covers anyone who purchased an Apple MacBook with a butterfly keyboard in seven states: California, New York, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Washington, and Michigan. That includes people who bought a MacBook model dating between 2015 and 2017, a MacBook Pro model between 2016 and 2019, or a MacBook Air between 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSU6Sr"&gt;Judge Edward Davila certified the case with seven subclasses on March 8th in California, but the order remained sealed until late last week. It raises the stakes for a suit that was first &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/05/23/second-macbook-pro-keyboard-class-action/"&gt;filed in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, three years after Apple added the controversial butterfly switches to its laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ei0D91"&gt;The butterfly keyboard was slimmer than Apple’s previous design, which used industry-standard scissor switches. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17366334/macbook-pro-keyboard-not-working-faulty-butterfly-lawsuit-wwdc-2018"&gt;many disgruntled MacBook users&lt;/a&gt; found that Apple’s revamped keyboard failed when even tiny particles of dust accumulated around the switches. That resulted in keys that felt “sticky,” failed to register keypresses, or registered multiple presses with a single hit. Apple tweaked its butterfly keyboard multiple times, but after continued complaints, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;abandoned the switches&lt;/a&gt; in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eiZilm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No matter how much lipstick you try to put on this pig ... it’s still ugly.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PistL0"&gt;This suit claims Apple knew for years that its butterfly switches were defective — and that its incremental changes weren’t fixing the core problem. It cites internal communications inside Apple, including an executive who wrote that “no matter how much lipstick you try to put on this pig [referring to the butterfly keyboard] . . . it’s still ugly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BC1CG"&gt;The plaintiffs accuse Apple of violating several laws across the seven states mentioned above, including California’s Unfair Competition Law, the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, and the Michigan Consumer Protection Act. They aren’t asking for a nationwide certification at this time, but the law firm behind the suit has invited &lt;a href="https://www.girardsharp.com/work-pending-macbook"&gt;any US buyer&lt;/a&gt; of an affected MacBook to complete a survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxH9XS"&gt;Apple argued against class action certification, saying one consolidated suit shouldn’t cover multiple tweaks to the butterfly keyboard. But the plaintiffs successfully argued that all butterfly keyboards may have the same fundamental problems due to their shallow design and narrow gaps between keys. “None of the design differences that Apple points to changed the tight spaces between the keys, nor the low-travel aspect of the design,” the order reads. Apple will have to argue later that these basic features didn’t actually make the design unreliable — and that it didn’t spend years knowingly making defective keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/spJhXlqpS2ljV6inVMR0CTAysv4=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005552/jpeters_210301_4457_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our desks can tell their own stories — and ours&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CGOpiX"&gt;Now that many of us are working from home (and it looks some will continue to do so, even after we’ve gotten past the worst of the pandemic), one of the most important places in those homes is our workspaces — in other words, our desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6iJY2"&gt;Everyone’s workspace is different. What kind of desk — and desk chair — do you use? Is your workspace neat and organized or filled with tchotchkes and toys? Do you have an old-fashioned wooden desk or a mechanized standing desk? Are you sitting on a stool or the latest Herman Miller desk chair? Is your workspace filled with this year’s high-end tech for working and gaming, or are you happy with a five-year-old laptop and a pair of headphones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EiPNnQ"&gt;In our “What’s on your desk?” series, we look into how people organize and use their workspace so that you can find out all of the various ways we see our spaces and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C33Cp8"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod mini reportedly has a secret temperature and humidity sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TD_fj5raCoRVePli0YJ9Ge0ocWo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005418/dseifert_201107_4281_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HomePod mini, released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="77cWg6"&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini smart speaker has an as-yet-undisclosed temperature and humidity sensor in its casing, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The sensor’s exact location was confirmed by iFixit, and it appears to be placed away from the speaker’s internal components so it can measure the external temperature. The exact sensor used is a 1.5 x 1.5mm HDC2010 Humidity and Temperature Digital Sensor from Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70XPfF"&gt;Although the sensor isn’t currently usable by HomePod mini owners, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;Apple has internally discussed allowing the sensor to provide information to other smart home devices like thermostats or fans. This could give smart heating equipment more information about how warm a room is or allow the speaker to trigger a device like a fan if it senses a room has reached a certain temperature. The functionality could work via HomeKit, Apple’s smart home ecosystem, which currently integrates with dozens of internet-connected thermostats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N5TJSb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The sensor may eventually be used with HomeKit devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8qi1Th"&gt;Amazon has previously included temperature sensors in Echo speakers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;its 2020 model&lt;/a&gt;, where the sensor can be used to trigger other devices via Alexa routines. Meanwhile, Google sells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17820594/nest-thermostat-remote-temperature-sensors-review-price-specs"&gt;standalone sensors via its Nest sub-brand&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Hub announced last week&lt;/a&gt; also includes a similar built-in sensor to help monitor your room’s temperature while you sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQzZm6"&gt;Although Apple declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; on its report (and did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; request for comment), on at least one occasion, it’s included hardware in a device that’s only been officially activated months later. Its 2008 iPod touch included a Bluetooth chip, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, but it wasn’t able to connect with Bluetooth devices until the year after its release. The hope is that a similar software update may be on the way for the HomePod mini. For those keeping track, major new HomePod firmware tends to release in the fall of each year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple ordered to pay $308.5 million after jury finds it infringed on  digital rights management patent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0R_xEYwzRpsShoBQaIwxoJ8GT0I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69002741/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sfBOqS"&gt;Apple has been ordered to pay $308.5 million to Personalized Media Communications after a federal jury in Texas found the company had infringed on a technology patent related to digital rights management, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/apple-told-to-pay-308-5-million-for-infringing-drm-patent?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. PMC had sued Apple over its FairPlay technology, used to distribute encrypted content from iTunes, Apple Music, and its App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlRcXH"&gt;PMC, which is a patent licensing firm, originally sued Apple in 2015, claiming the tech giant had infringed seven of its patents. Apple successfully challenged the case to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, but an appeals court reversed the patent board’s decision last March, and the case went to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnqclD"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday, but told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; it would appeal the ruling. “Cases like this, brought by companies that don’t make or sell any products, stifle innovation and ultimately harm consumers,” Apple’s statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKEr2U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-ip-idUSKBN2BC04I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Sugarland, Texas-based PMC also has infringement cases pending against Netflix, Google, and Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro looks even better than a real one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKfzK4MEgHc9NL_E6dxEaIyDTDA=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68996280/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_1.50.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="48SGu8"&gt;Intel launched a new ad campaign starring Justin Long, Apple’s “I’m a Mac” actor, but for this campaign, Long is singing the praises of PC laptops and comparing them to MacBooks. The thing is, for reasons that we can’t quite figure out, Intel actually made the MacBook Pros in its commercials look &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than they do in real life, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/my4ZjCUkTsI"&gt;tech YouTuber Rene Ritchie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHxUsS"&gt;Take a look at these two photos. The one on the left is a photo of a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip taken for &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; review. The one on the right is taken from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;this Intel ad&lt;/a&gt;. Can you spot the difference? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gCbYEy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10402291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQAO3Z"&gt;I’ll spoil it for you: Intel’s version of the MacBook Pro has &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; thinner screen bezels, making it a nearly edge-to-edge display. I’d love it if my MacBook’s bezels were this thin! (Though Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro doesn’t have a webcam. Bummer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfrVaf"&gt;But Intel’s fabled all-screen MacBook Pro didn’t make just one appearance. It’s also &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;in this ad&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to ding the MacBook Pro for not being a 2-in-1. Look at that Mac — all screen! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Umm86hxxxDCxyXPZek-082_221Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383686/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.08.32_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="deOxPX"&gt;Intel did confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Friday that it used real MacBook Pros with an M1 chip in the commercials, but the company wouldn’t initially say what it may or may not have changed about them: “With respect to filming and showcasing details, we’re not commenting at this time,” an Intel spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NmIWF"&gt;However, Intel’s Ryan Shrout confirmed a likely theory on Saturday: Intel changed the look of the MacBook Pros’ screens in post-production, which had the happenstance effect of making their screens look better than they do in real life. It was a rush job, apparently, and they made a mistake when compositing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ZhPwq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Also, the composite on the Macs made the bezels look smaller than they should be, another mistake in composite due to time. We recorded using the current shipping M1-based machines.&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Shrout (@ryanshrout) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanshrout/status/1373339942533926917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e0FVO2"&gt;(If you look at the image from the second ad, you can also see some kind of blackish-haze applied over the screen, which probably wouldn’t be there in reality.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Q96gD"&gt;These ads, in my opinion, are also kind of missing the point. None of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;Intel’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfHplU5fatE"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HebkohrCns"&gt;commercials&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate how Intel’s chips can compete with the MacBook Pro’s real advantage: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s speedy and battery-efficient M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;. (So far, Intel has only produced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272041/intel-apple-macbook-m1-performance-benchmarks-processors"&gt;cherry-picked benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; to try and hit back at the M1.) And by trying to dunk on the MacBook Pro, Intel is also, in a way, dunking on itself, since it still provides chips for some models of the Apple laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1k50q1"&gt;And seriously, doesn’t that all-screen MacBook Pro just look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnauH2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 20th, 9PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Intel’s confirmation that it was a compositing error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IsIoq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Shrout tweeted on Saturday, not Sunday, because it is not Sunday yet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22340964/twitter-accounts-bots-days-of-the-week-what-day-is-it"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I blame Daniel Craig.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brazil regulator fines Apple $2 million for not including chargers with iPhone 12</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9RLt8N"&gt;The consumer protection agency in Brazil’s São Paulo state has fined Apple $2 million for failing to include chargers within iPhone 12 boxes, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/20/brazil-agency-fines-apple-iphone-12-charger/"&gt;according to&lt;em&gt; 9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Procon-SP says Apple engaged in “misleading advertising, selling a device without the charger and unfair terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhGqAY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple announced in October&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 12 and would not come with chargers or earbuds in their boxes, citing environmental concerns. By only including a USB-C to Lightning cable with iPhone 12 and other new models, Apple said it would be able to reduce the raw materials for each iPhone it sells, in addition to reducing the size of the phones’ boxes. Critics suggested the change had more to do with allowing Apple to reduce shipping costs, and environmental experts said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;impact on the environment would likely be minimal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5YEJv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/procon-na-midia/"&gt;Procon&lt;/a&gt; said it asked Apple whether the company would reduce the iPhone 12’s price since there were no chargers included, and did not receive a response. The agency also accused the company of failing to help customers who had “problems with some functions” on their iPhones following updates. A spokesman for the agency said Apple “needs to respect these laws and these institutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL1kTN"&gt;The fine does not seem like it would be particularly troubling for Apple, which had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;$111.4 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt; in the first quarter of 2021 (that total includes 2020 holiday sales of iPhone 12 models). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mw50E"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple discontinuing two configurations of its 21.5 inch iMac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUWgd5-YJjYedvU_sL9yJ_k_sj8=/48x0:2808x1840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999258/Screen_Shot_2020_08_04_at_11.10.17_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The 21.5 and 27 inch iMacs | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fGSntk"&gt;Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316831/apple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last"&gt;discontinued the iMac Pro,&lt;/a&gt; and two configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are now joining the Pro in retirement. As spotted &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/20/512gb-1tb-ssd-imac-21-discontinued/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 512GB and 1TB SSD configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are no longer available for purchase, with only the 256GB SSD and 1TB Fusion drive versions available to buy on Apple’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlNXBM"&gt;Both configurations appeared &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/21-5-inch-imac-ssd-upgrades-unavailable/"&gt;unavailable for purchase&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s website as of last month, but at the time it was not clear if that was a supply issue or a permanent discontinuation of the two options. But now both the 512GB and 1TB SSD options are gone from the iMac configuration page, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugEhbO"&gt;A big iMac redesign has been rumored in the works for some time. Apple is expected to replace the 27-inch and 21.5-inch versions of the iMac with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt; and will likely revamp the Mac Pro sometime this year. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the update would have a flat-back design and do away with the “chin” beneath the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuOIe5"&gt;The new iMacs are expected to use Apple silicon chips, as the company continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;shift away from Intel chips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
