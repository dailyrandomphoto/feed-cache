    <title>Apple sues 11-year veteran MacBook designer for allegedly stealing trade secrets for a journalist</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8u8rBK"&gt;Apple is suing Simon Lancaster, a former product design architect at the company, accusing him of selling trade secrets and details on unreleased Apple products to an unnamed media correspondent. Lancaster apparently did this in hopes of gaining publicity for his next venture after leaving Apple. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/11/apple-sues-former-employee-over-device-leaks-to-media"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported on the legal filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03nWQN"&gt;“Tens of thousands of Apple employees work tirelessly every day on new products, services and features in the hopes of delighting our customers and empowering them to change the world. Stealing ideas and confidential information undermines their efforts, hurting Apple and our customers,” commented Apple in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We take very seriously this individual’s deliberate theft of our trade secrets, violation of our ethics and our policies, all for personal gain. We will do all we can to protect the innovations we hold so dear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbXqLk"&gt;According to Apple’s suit, Lancaster and his correspondent began communicating in 2018 about the possibility of obtaining information; the two then spent the next year in communication. Lancaster then reportedly contacted his correspondent in spring 2019, asking him to investigate rumors of a potential Apple product that could “mean trouble for my startup.” The lawsuit also claims that Lancaster boasted to a third party shortly after that conversation that his media contact would be writing a story on his startup if it hit $1 million in funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpnIE4"&gt;In October 2019, Lancaster reportedly notified his correspondent that he was planning to leave Apple, giving over secret information on Apple products and asking if they wanted “to write a story about a 12-year Apple Design Veteran leaving for an amazing startup?” The correspondent also allegedly asked Lancaster to get additional information on an unannounced project that Apple refers to as “Project X.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ0Uz1"&gt;Lancaster then submitted his notice of resignation to Apple on October 15th, but kept chatting with his media source — the next day, they allegedly asked for specific documents they wanted Lancaster to get before he left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDRJhH"&gt;Apple also alleges that Lancaster specifically attended a meeting about “Project X” even after he had submitted his resignation notice, specifically to get more information to pass along to his media contact, despite the fact that he had been instructed by other employees not to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSZRmH"&gt;The company also claims that Lancaster used his Apple credentials to download confidential information almost up until his employment ended at midnight on November 1st, 2019. According to Apple, Lancaster logged in from an external location at 10:24PM that day — this time, to get materials that the company says would help his new employer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARMU4S"&gt;Lancaster &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fwhy-i-left-apple-joined-arris-composites-simon-lancaster-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325827%2Fapple-lawsuit-macbook-designer-simon-lancaster-trade-secrets-leaks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;started working at Apple in 2008&lt;/a&gt; and spent 11 years working at the company, serving as advanced materials lead and product design architect in his final role there &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fwhy-i-left-apple-joined-arris-composites-simon-lancaster-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325827%2Fapple-lawsuit-macbook-designer-simon-lancaster-trade-secrets-leaks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;before leaving in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to join Arris Composites, a material design company, as its head of consumer products. &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191122005108/en/Simon-Lancaster-Former-Advanced-Materials-Lead-at-Apple-Joins-Arris-Composites-to-Unlock-Future-of-Consumer-Products"&gt;According to a press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing his switch to Arris, Lancaster worked on the 13-inch and 15-inch Macbook Pro with Touch Bar redesigns, along with “unreleased Apple products.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is down to its lowest price yet at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gp87MpEN52NqscYEa18exklB5S8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948540/dbohn_201109_4283_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XmzMm7"&gt;At $129, Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is an expensive accessory. But if you are looking to buy this charger at a more reasonable price, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734624700779477900#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has knocked $29 off the MagSafe Duo&lt;/a&gt; today, bringing the price down to $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLZ0eF"&gt;The MagSafe duo is a 2-in-1 charger that allows you to wirelessly charge select iPhones, Apple Watches, certain AirPods wireless charging cases, and other Qi-certified devices. If you plan to buy this charger, keep in mind that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;does not include a USB-C charging brick&lt;/a&gt;, which you will need to buy separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DM0Q7t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTx0D8"&gt;If you’re an Apple Watch owner who has either a 40mm or 44mm model and you are looking to buy a new loop for your wearable, you’re in luck. &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-sport-loop-for-apple-watch-40-or-44-mm"&gt;Daily Steals&lt;/a&gt; is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers the opportunity to buy an Apple Watch Sport Loop in select colors for only $18 with code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEAPL &lt;/strong&gt;applied at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AGuII"&gt;We think this is a good deal for a few reasons, most notably because these are Apple-branded Sport Loops, which normally retail for $49 on Apple’s direct website. Additionally, a few colors are not available on Apple’s website that Daily Steals has available, such as a Pride-themed Sport Loop. These Sport Loops also include a one-year warranty through Apple. It’s worth noting, though, that there are more options for the 44mm-sized Apple Watch models than 40mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCHb2t"&gt;This promotional code only applies to one strap in your cart, so if you buy more than one, the code will only adjust the price for one unit. However, we had luck getting this deal twice with two separate transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bpArmf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386212"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qzizg3"&gt;Best Buy knocked down the price of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734506907090543434" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a refurbished pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; to $80. If you are apprehensive about buying refurbished products, Woot is currently selling a brand-new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://sellout.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-wireless-earbuds-13?ref=w_gw_dd_8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s bean-shaped wireless earbuds in black for only $105&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QeIuf9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="F8Wn77"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly denies Parler’s App Store appeal, citing derogatory terms and ‘Nazi symbols’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yP8YutyzG6d7B9X6LQEDp11Oglw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944888/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9cLIw"&gt;Apple has reportedly denied social media company Parler’s bid to reenter the iOS App Store, saying its platform hasn’t addressed problems with offensive content. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/parler-cuts-ios-team-after-apple-blocks-return-to-app-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported the news earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, quoting a message reportedly sent on February 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVsGFX"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple said that Parler’s &lt;a href="https://legal.parler.com/documents/guidelines.pdf"&gt;latest community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; still didn’t meet its standards. “Simple searches reveal highly objectionable content, including easily identified offensive uses of derogatory terms regarding race, religion and sexual orientation, as well as Nazi symbols,” it reportedly told Parler. “For these reasons your app cannot be returned to the App Store for distribution until it complies with the guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eUzW2M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Parler expects and hopes to keep working with Apple”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwnqMt"&gt;Parler’s guidelines ban threats, spam, and some other categories of content. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;right-wing-friendly network’s&lt;/a&gt; policies remain permissive compared to other social platforms, and its stated goal is that “removing users or user-provided content be kept to the absolute minimum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6lPLq"&gt;That strategy has put it at odds with several major companies. Apple and Google both banned its app from their mobile stores in January, following the January 6th mob attack on the US Capitol. And Amazon took the site offline by suspending its web hosting agreement, saying representatives had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;raised concerns about violent threats&lt;/a&gt; preceding the attack. Parler responded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;filing suit against Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, although it has since relaunched on a different hosting service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnaONX"&gt;In a statement on Thursday, Parler said the network had added significant new filtering mechanisms since the initial ban. “We have since engaged Apple to show them how we’ve incorporated a combination of algorithmic filters and human review to detect and remove content that threatens or incites violence,” said Parler Chief Policy Office Amy Peikoff. “Parler expects and hopes to keep working with Apple to return to the App Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gMbx3"&gt;Peikoff also touted new filtering options that enable users to block racist and gendered attacks out of their feeds. However, the filters are optional, and are consistent with Apple’s claim that derogatory terms and hate symbols remain present on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aW47qi"&gt;While Peikoff maintains that Parler hopes to return to iOS, the company is already taking steps to divest from the platform. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;also reports that Parler cut ties with its last three iOS app developers alongside four other employees. The company still maintains an Android app that can be side-loaded from outside Google’s Play Store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284036/parler-social-network-relaunch-new-hosting"&gt;its site relaunched&lt;/a&gt; on February 15th. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KJzwW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9:10 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Added statement from Parler.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on a Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="adobe signature" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjbjjFADHTq31dc0jvrpDmyryDw=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941923/Adobe-Reader-EchoSign-iPad-Ink_Signature_Tool.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="biDYjK"&gt;Even before the COVID-19 pandemic closed most offices, more and more official papers were being turned into PDF documents. (PDF stands for Portable Document Format; it is a standard created by Adobe in the early 1990s that allows paper documents to be turned into exact digital copies.) These days, hard copy paperwork is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule. However, even digital documents have to be signed. You can do it the long way — print those documents out, sign them, and then scan them back into your computer — or you can create a digital signature and place it directly on the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldxgQF"&gt;If you’re using a Mac, the process is refreshingly easy — just use the built-in Preview app to create and save your digital signature.  (If you’re using a Windows PC, unfortunately, it’s not quite as simple.) After that, when you open a PDF using Preview, it will be a simple matter of dropping the signature into the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wuj5t1"&gt;To create your signature, you first have to have a PDF ready:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FqdcaZ"&gt;Open a PDF document using your Mac’s built-in Preview app. (If you don’t have a PDF document handy, you can create one with your favorite word processor and save it as a PDF file.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTP7Vf"&gt;Open the Markup tool, either by clicking on the “pen in a circle” symbol on the top right of the Preview window or by selecting View &amp;gt; Show Markup Toolbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9tESYh"&gt;Click on the Signature icon (it’s the one that looks like a signature on a line)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the Signature icon to create your signature via trackpad, camera, or phone" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UUzOkY0V_xOxGmA2jcph5CZPuPQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357983/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_3.00.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the Signature icon to create your signature via trackpad, camera, or phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gOqMsK"&gt;Now, you can create your signature. As you can see from the three buttons on top of the window, you have a choice of three methods: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YZoTUM"&gt;Select Trackpad. Click on the “Click Here to Begin” button in the center of the screen, sign your name on the trackpad, hit any key, and then click on “Done.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tF4TPe"&gt;Write your name on a piece of white paper, select Camera, and hold the paper up to the camera (and on the line that appears across the screen) until you see the signature appear on the screen. (Two notes: first, the signature will appear reversed as you hold it up, but the digitized version will be correct. Also, if there are any other markings on the paper or if the paper doesn’t fill the screen, you are likely to get other markings recorded besides the signature, so you may need to try it a couple of times to get it right.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="As you hold your written signature up to the camera, it will appear reversed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bw8S_766-dKovKfLDHMnZFnJVsg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357988/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.26.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you hold your written signature up to the camera, it will appear reversed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror-image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DH8G9WgqNgZSplZCnVpDfYeaBYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357992/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.29.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="HedzDU"&gt;Select iPhone. If you have an iPhone associated with the Mac, your phone will almost immediately pop up a field on which you can write your signature; your signature will be mirrored on your Mac.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror-image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O7c_r1m6Yo-O7GwkqYvJqIRUBFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358000/mysig.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This screenshot shows what the signature field looks like on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="As you write, the signature will simultaneously appear on your screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9X2ZS9zUPN0qTZ-lpYuolp4Kh0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358019/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.34.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you write, the signature will simultaneously appear on your screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AgSFFf"&gt;With any of these methods, if you need to try again, just hit the “Clear” button on the lower left of the window to get rid of the unwanted signature. Once you’re happy with it, click on “Done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWPnNK"&gt;Now, whenever you want to add your signature to a document in Preview, just click on the Signature icon and click on your signature. It will appear in a box on your document which you can then use to adjust the size and location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your signature will now appear under the Signature icon in the Preview app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1t60BhdsgBtpswS5moYEm85nzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358020/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.42.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your signature will now appear under the Signature icon in the Preview app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can move the signature to where you want it and make it larger or smaller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="53mHeR"&gt;And if you want a second signature, just create it in the same way. After that, when you click the Signature icon, you’ll see both signatures and can select the one you want to use. Don’t need one of the signatures anymore? Hover over the signature until you see a small “x” next to it, and click on that to delete it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can save up to $21 on select Nintendo Switch games for Mario Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Mario Odyssey" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x50RGKR90fsJSF3z8stwJIAgJt4=/96x0:1161x710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941706/mario.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XVmATT"&gt;Today is “MAR10 Day,” and although it is not Mario’s “birthday” (which is September 13th), this day usually has some of the best deals on games published by Nintendo. Nintendo rarely discounts its first-party games, so if you recently purchased a Switch and want to stock up on some games, today is a good day to expand your game library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPa1fQ"&gt;Several retailers — including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Mario+bros+Switch+games&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734509568504630408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fcollection%2Fmario-bros" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fnintendo-switch-games%2F2636_4646529_4234943&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; — are slashing the prices of some Nintendo games, with up to $21 in savings available. Most of the games feature the mustachioed plumber, some of which are available for $39, such as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-Odyssey-Switch-Nintendo-Digital-Download%2F967828360&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03092021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fmario-tennis-aces%2F10157967.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Tennis Aces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1005868/9383?subId1=VergeDeals031021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNew-Super-Mario-Bros-U-Deluxe-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496592691%2F214311136&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Super Mario Bros.

Other deals include $40 for titles like &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496590475%2F55432571&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPaper-Mario-The-Origami-King-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496596767%2F720441771&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Mario: The Origami King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496592998%2F467273231&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.

&lt;div id="tUWACf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514828"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FCcO8q"&gt;The DualSense controller is a successor to the DualShock 4 and features adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, and haptic feedback technologies that aim to deliver better in-game feedback. You get one when you buy a PS5 console, but if you want to grab another or if you want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591013/steam-input-api-ps5-dualsense-controller-support#:~:text=Valve%20has%20officially%20announced%20that,display%20the%20correct%20button%20prompts."&gt;use this controller on Steam&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab one &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/sony-sony-ps5-dual-sense-white-sony-dual-sense-wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $60 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;; that’s $10 off its usual price of $70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7HELnA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JE13Qw"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are some of the best true wireless earbuds on the market right now. My colleague Chris Welch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;named the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners last year. You can grab &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new pair for $190 at Woot&lt;/a&gt; while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kN98th"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fva4HV"&gt;One of the most unconventional wireless earbuds available on the market right now is Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live. Despite the odd design, these bean-shaped earbuds produce a powerful sound and have lengthy battery life. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734506907090543434" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly overestimated iPhone 12 mini demand, by a lot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PX2wXenA5__HmquoXnkOMHZwero=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940493/vpavic_4279_20201107_0043.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GwFmuf"&gt;Apple is cutting production of the iPhone 12 mini in the first half of this year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-slashes-planned-iPhone-12-mini-production-for-1H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Planned production of the smallest iPhone 12 model has reportedly been reduced by 70 percent or more in the first half of this year, making up the majority of a 20 percent cut in total iPhone 12 production. Some suppliers have been asked to temporarily stop producing iPhone 12 mini-specific components, while other parts are being reallocated to the Pro and Pro Max, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCFt4B"&gt;Alongside the iPhone production news, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple has pushed back production for two new Apple Silicon MacBooks. Originally due to enter mass production in May or June, the laptops will now be manufactured in the second half of the year. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t reveal which of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; these could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="93q6qX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iPhone production is still expected to be up overall compared to 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOTPMS"&gt;Despite the cuts, iPhone production is still scheduled to be up overall compared to 2020. Apple reportedly plans to produce 75 million handsets in the first half of the year, and 230 million phones over the course of 2021. Part of the reason is though to be because Apple was overly aggressive in booking up production capacity in the first place ahead of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. The shortage is now creating problems for companies both inside and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;outside&lt;/a&gt; of the technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqyNCZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report is the latest indication that Apple’s miniature addition to its flagship smartphone lineup hasn’t lived up to expectations. Last month&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/apple-iphone-12-mini-sales-slow-as-smaller-smartphones-lose-appeal-report-idUKKBN2A91N0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on analyst data which claimed sales of the 12 mini had made up just five percent of Apple’s smartphone sales in the first half of January. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports that as of the end of last year, the mini made up 10 to 15 percent of Apple’s iPhone 12 series orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7HjEh"&gt;Although we liked the iPhone 12 mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;when we reviewed it&lt;/a&gt;, overall smartphone demand is trending towards phones with bigger screens. And while the 12 mini also benefits from being cheaper than the other handsets in the iPhone 12 lineup, customers have the option of &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-disappointed/#h-iphone-12-mini-sales:~:text=The%20CIRP%20report%20also%20touches%20on,be%20more%20enticing%20for%20certain%20buyers%3A"&gt;buying previous year’s models&lt;/a&gt; if they want to save money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to block ad tracking on your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7i381_390v3EmPJR4vG1EUJHbKc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68932275/akrales_180620_1777_0259.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jwd5Mq"&gt;In 2019, an &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/28/its-middle-night-do-you-know-who-your-iphone-is-talking/?utm_term=.f643c2a83a4c"&gt;article in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Geoffrey Fowler described the author’s shock when he discovered just how many of his iPhone apps were collecting and uploading information about his usage while he slept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqUHGx"&gt;As we all know by now, data is a huge commodity these days. If you use a phone, laptop, or any type of computing device (unless you’re a security expert or a high-end hacker with access to sophisticated blocking tools), you’re paying for your apps by contributing marketing and other info to the companies that supply them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdXttf"&gt;As Fowler’s article demonstrated, iPhone users are not immune to this. Since his article was published, Apple has made some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;laudable changes to its privacy policies&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s still a good idea to take charge of your own data. There are some simple ways to minimize the amount of tracking that app vendors can do and the amount of data they can access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="exJEUb"&gt;Turn off personalized and location-based ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WBCofK"&gt;According to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223"&gt;Advertising &amp;amp; Privacy&lt;/a&gt; page: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="q8RHB4"&gt;Apple’s advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wLQYsb"&gt;However, the page goes on to say that contextual data, such as info about your device, its location, your App Store searches, and what you read on Apple News could be collected. You can get around this somewhat by &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074"&gt;turning off personalized and location-based ads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qhWD8Y"&gt;To turn off personalized ads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WdWeaM"&gt;Select your “Settings” app, tap on “Privacy,” and scroll down to and select “Apple Advertising” (it will be near the bottom of the list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7xqUx9"&gt;Toggle “Personalized Ads” off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYufa7jODsVR4KBYI-5I5otB6oc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354741/IMG_DBA61BE67C50_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can toggle off personalized ads from Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also toggle off Location Services" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgXwGGyt03lg7-aKZwHOjlkcjEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354742/IMG_B32453FF7846_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also toggle off Location Services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tFThlr"&gt;To turn off location-based ads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="exNzsg"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services” (at the top of the display).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RGKWdi"&gt;Toggle off “Location Services.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IuI4ot"&gt;On this page, you can also change several of your apps, such as the App Store or Maps, to allow location access never, ask next time, or while using the app. Also, note that you can still use the “Find My Phone” feature; it will temporarily enable Location Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGtgw9"&gt;If you want to see how effectively your phone is protected, you could try taking the &lt;a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/"&gt;Panopticlick test&lt;/a&gt;, which is offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It monitors device fingerprinting, among other things. I ran it on an Apple iPhone 11 after following the above instructions, and I got a “partial protection” result for blocking tracking ads, blocking invisible trackers, and protecting from fingerprinting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1wLgon"&gt;Lock down Safari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2syYGD"&gt;If you use the Safari browser on your iPhone, there are several things you can do to make it safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In your iPhone’s Settings, select “Safari”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yP9Skpg9JRA8To7I-bgYpfkkBp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354806/IMG_6A5B7FC23344_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your iPhone’s Settings, select “Safari.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Enabling “Block All Cookies” is more secure, but can also be inconvenient" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U0R5Ln16IilJQLWG23TK8Q4zXJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354812/IMG_06711E4C44E2_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enabling “Block All Cookies” is more secure but can also be inconvenient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9Lo0v1"&gt;Go to “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zdMkKN"&gt;Select “Safari,” and scroll down to the “Privacy &amp;amp; Security” section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="or38q5"&gt;Turn on “Prevent Cross-Site Tracking” (which means advertisers and other third-party content providers can’t track you from one site to another).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oX8nX2"&gt;Turn on “Block All Cookies.” The cookies collected by various websites can contain a great deal of information about how you use the site, what info you put into it, etc. By blocking cookies, you prevent that data from being collected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8bM4Zf"&gt;However, you will probably make things very inconvenient for yourself. Your visits to sites will not be recorded, so, for example, you may not be able to revisit a playlist or repurchase the same T-shirt you bought last year. Some sites will even refuse entry if you don’t allow them to collect cookies. It’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fv7b88"&gt;Turn off Background App Refresh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0XgVrk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202070"&gt;According to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, the reason to have Background App Refresh turned on is to allow suspended apps (apps that aren’t currently active) to “check for updates and new content.” According to Disconnect, the privacy app company that Geoffrey Fowler cites in his article, it also allows apps to collect marketable tracking data and transmit that data even when you’re not using the app. Interestingly, iPhones ship with Background App Refresh turned on, but it’s not terribly hard to turn off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eAlq90"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:6359379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2sishI"&gt;Go to “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EKg5tY"&gt;Select “General.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NxM8Zy"&gt;Select “Background App Refresh.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UX9E4h"&gt;You’ll see a list of all the apps that use this feature, and they’re all going to be turned on. Find “Background App Refresh” at the top of the page, and tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ITsFC2"&gt;You’ll be brought to a page that lets you enable it for Wi-Fi and cellular data, for Wi-Fi only, or you can turn it off altogether. Select “Off.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XNsYpK"&gt;If you go back to the previous page, you’ll see that all of the toggles for the various apps are completely gone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ahdHe2"&gt;You may want to be selective about which apps can work in the background. Some apps might not work well otherwise. For example, Google Photos won’t automatically back up your camera roll unless this feature is enabled. So you can, if you wish, leave “Background App Refresh” on, and then choose which specific apps you want to toggle off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spice up your daily pandemic walk with these apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JTL09TXMNTLmfl06h24EoUsf-k=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68931867/final.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Keep the routine fresh&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vfp7Lm"&gt;As you may have heard one or two times, we’re now roughly a year into COVID and pandemic lockdown life. To fill the void in our lives that was once occupied by social gatherings, visiting family, and breathing indoor air freely, many of us have turned to new hobbies and habits. Some of them are even healthy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEv0XJ"&gt;Taking a daily or, if I’m being honest, &lt;em&gt;semi&lt;/em&gt;-daily walk is a lockdown habit that has seen me through These Unprecedented Times. I’m &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roobeekeane/status/1347644813320073220?s=20"&gt;not alone, either&lt;/a&gt; — without gyms or really anywhere else to go at all, lots of us have embraced (or at times, endured) a daily walk around the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5qr1L"&gt;To be sure, it’s not always easy. I got tired of walking by the same houses and the same pieces of fossilized trash about six months in. It rains a lot where I live and that can turn an otherwise pleasant walk into a real bummer. Other days, the motivation just isn’t there and the mailbox is as far as I get. But a few tricks along the way have helped me and fellow &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers stay committed to the walk ritual. Here are some techniques to keep your pandemic walk routine fresh and the apps that can help you put them into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BIctUh"&gt;Find a new route&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vw0WdGgH1BgVp5TrwbEgDrqQfgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354699/footpath.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footpath helps you map out new routes and gives you key information like elevation change along the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bEBgeP"&gt;This year I’ve embraced the life-changing magic of hauling myself out of my own neighborhood and going on a walk somewhere else. It feels counterproductive driving somewhere to take a walk, but it really does help shake things up when I’m burned out on my usual route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zvSG2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alltrails.com/"&gt;AllTrails&lt;/a&gt; is an app popular with hikers, but it’s also great for finding nearby parks and trails you may not know about, whether you’re in an urban spot or farther from the city. There’s also an active community who leave helpful tips, like whether the restrooms are a horror show or if the parking lot is a hotspot for break-ins. All of its basic features are available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZygxB3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://footpathapp.com/"&gt;Footpath&lt;/a&gt; is another good tool to help identify a new route, whether it’s close to home or somewhere unfamiliar. Use the app’s detailed street map to draw roughly where you’d like to go; the app will snap your route to the nearest streets and pathways. Footpath gives you important details about the route like mileage, elevation gain / loss along the way, and even a time estimate that factors in hills so you know what you’re getting into. You can trace out the full route or draw a path to a destination you’d like to reach and the app can create a loop route back to your starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEtefm"&gt;The free version will help you brainstorm some new walks, but more advanced features like turn-by-turn navigation — iPhone only for now but coming to Android soon — require an Elite subscription ($23.49 annually). Alternatively, you can add Elite features to individual saved routes for a one-time fee of $1.99 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Rmyp3f"&gt;Make it mindful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khOWzU"&gt;Any therapist or Silicon Valley CEO will tell you about the benefits of meditation. My brain is too noisy for a traditional sitting-and-breathing meditation, but I find walking meditations a lot easier to get into. &lt;a href="https://app.www.calm.com/program/wAzjO76/mindful-walking"&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.headspace.com/meditation/walking-meditation"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; (each is $69 for an annual subscription) offer walking meditations of various lengths; the ones offered by Headspace are tailored to more specific circumstances, like walking in a city or just back and forth at home. There are also plenty of free options if you search YouTube or your streaming music service of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aES93I"&gt;Find something to tune into&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/05OGacEC6uRchhIWbp9WT1AFXww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354708/apple_time_to_walk_apple_watch_airpods_01252021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time to Walk is an Apple Fitness Plus feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vhm8rP"&gt;Finding a bite-sized podcast to listen to during walk time is a nice bonus incentive to take a break and head out the door. &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2rTT1klKUoQNuaW2Ah19Pa?si=b5snZO3iT66QKGQPD24Yqw"&gt;NPR’s &lt;em&gt;Short Wave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a quick ten-ish minutes with episodes every weekday. One of my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues uses her walk to catch up on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/06iGnWl5EnkJktsKhSNeAQ?si=brnULdIcRHi2RbOUrfm4lQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gamertag Radio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Or check out an audio book from your local library with the &lt;a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/"&gt;Libby app&lt;/a&gt; to make walk time double up as your reading time. And for something a little more freeform, use the time to listen in on a conversation on &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; or Twitter Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONIgIv"&gt;If you’re an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-fitness-plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22320002%2Fwalking-apps-pandemic-strava-footpath-alltrails-seek" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; subscriber, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;Time to Walk&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. Featured celebrities like Dolly Parton share stories, recorded as they walk in places that are meaningful to them. It’s a nice, reflective experience with a diverse range of hosts. You will need a subscription to Apple’s $79 / year fitness service and an Apple Watch, so it’s more likely to be an option if you’re already invested in those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LOz6NS"&gt;Gamify it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f12e8YMF5OIjGprB0TbULvPTCmw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354714/seek.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seek helps you identify local animals and plant life, rewarding you with badges as you observe more species.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WFthGB"&gt;It works on kids and it works on adults: when all else fails, turn it into a game. Tracking walks on &lt;a href="https://www.mapmyrun.com/app"&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/mobile"&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt; can give you that extra sense of accountability and accomplishment when you get back home and tap the “finish” button. It’s a neat little trick that works on my lizard brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJypyF"&gt;Or, do as another of my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues does and take note of local critters and plant life with the &lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app"&gt;Seek app&lt;/a&gt;. It uses your phone’s camera to identify plants, birds, and other kinds of fauna. Best of all, it will keep track of species you’ve indentified and award badges as you identify more. Badges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="asxYQT"&gt;Of course, that’s just the real-life version of the classic catch ‘em all game. Another &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer uses that oldie but goodie &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to keep her neighborhood walks interesting. If you missed its rise in popularity the first time around, here’s the gist: several years ago, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; tricked a bunch of us into going outside to look for AR characters in real-life locations. Once you find them, you can capture them by flinging virtual pokéballs at them on your phone screen. Keep it casual and just see how many different pokémon you encounter and capture on your walk route, or seek out rarer pokémon more aggressively. It’s your world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and nonprofit Common Sense Media team up to provide kid podcast recs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5yi4JxpFcgJiPb1wdfjGZdTZY_s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68928583/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJce2y"&gt;Apple is making it easier for parents to find podcasts to listen to with their kids. The company is teaming up with nonprofit Common Sense Media, which specializes in age-based content reviews, to curate various collections that’ll appear in the Apple Podcasts app in the US and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshowsforkids&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F8%2F22316197%2Fapple-podcasts-common-sense-media-kids-content" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. The initial four themes focus on narrative storytelling, shows that kids themselves recommend, mysteries and dramas, and Common Sense’s “all-time” picks. Programming comes from Tinkercast, American Public Media, WNYC Studios, Rebel Girls, and Nickelodeon, among others, and Common Sense will provide age group recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nljTL"&gt;The collections will be updated monthly with new themes being tied to “important historical and cultural moments,” like Women’s History Month. You’ll see these show suggestions starting today in Apple Podcasts’ main homepage carousel, and then they’ll be available through the Browse tab indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZWk5bi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Four collections will launch today&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wTL4E9"&gt;Podcasts for children have become increasingly popular as the hype around audio grows and parents look for ways to keep their kids entertained without relying on a screen. Common Sense &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/the-best-podcasts-for-kids"&gt;previously published&lt;/a&gt; podcast recommendations, but this new partnership with Apple represents its biggest commitment to audio programming yet. Hot Pod writer Nick Quah &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/kids-podcasts-see-a-bump/"&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt; that kid podcast creators saw huge bumps in listenership at the start of the pandemic. One company, Gen-Z Media, said its show &lt;em&gt;Six Minutes &lt;/em&gt;performed about 2 million downloads a month, but during the pandemic, it was on track for 3 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYSdcw"&gt;Other companies, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200272/spotify-kids-playlist-rollout-app-launch-beta"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436457/amazon-kids-rebranding-freetime"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, place their kid-approved content into separate apps and experiences. Apple seems to think that’s unnecessary for now and that parents can instead rely on themed collections to oversee what their kids enjoy listening to. Apple &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; provide a kid-oriented device experience, but that’s more to give parents control and insight into what their children are consuming than having Apple actually whitelist content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple mixed-reality headset likely coming sometime in 2022, analyst predicts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GM6j7JAfkcWWDb-2Kqv5qjSxH0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925839/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rC9zwg"&gt;Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts in a new research note that Apple will release a “helmet-type” mixed reality headset next year, augmented reality glasses in mid-2025, and an AR contact lens product by 2030-2040, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jLmg9"&gt;“We foresee that the helmet product will provide AR and VR experiences, while glasses and contact lens types of products are more likely to focus on AR applications,” Kuo writes in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAGYsV"&gt;While several prototypes of Apple’s mixed reality headset weigh between 200 and 300 grams, Kuo says, if Apple can solve some technical problems the headset could end up weighing between 100 and 200 grams, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reported. He added that the headset will likely be priced in the $1,000 range in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERZ1mP"&gt;The headset will be able to offer an immersive experience Kuo says will be “significantly better” than those on the market now, with Sony micro-OLED displays, and should be able to run independently of an iPhone, “more like a portable product” than a mobile one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b5abT"&gt;Kuo’s note is mostly in line with other predictions of a headset &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;hitting the market sometime in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but with the price tag closer to $3,000. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that Apple was using a fabric mesh material to reduce the weight of the headset, and had a rendering based on “internal Apple images of a late-stage prototype” that showed what the headset might look like. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEEyykaSpa2_RPdULlxgpgJj3aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280992/3b786602_c662_4696_b68c_21f89e4a4e95.jpg"&gt;
