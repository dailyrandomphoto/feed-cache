    <title>Apple TV Plus teases its WeWork series with Jared Leto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qaqc5gTRluquHR5cZVdYm-1xw40=/0x0:4664x3109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410005/Apple_TV_WeCrashed_key_art.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JTUWwi"&gt;A new trailer gives us a glimpse of Apple TV Plus’ &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming miniseries about the real-life buildup and dramatic downfall of WeWork, the coworking space with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;weirdly bombastic public filing&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975831/wework-layoffs-ipo-adam-neumann-softbank"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; thousands of employees while later giving its brash CEO a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926583/wework-founder-adam-neumann-softbank-takeover-payout"&gt;huge golden parachute&lt;/a&gt;. The script practically writes itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urg8uV"&gt;Jared Leto stars as WeWork’s former eccentric CEO, Adam Neumann, while Anne Hathaway takes on the role of his wife, Rebekah Neumann, who served as the company’s chief brand and impact officer and was former CEO of WeGrow. The trailer opens with Leto reimagining a run-down building as a vibrant office space — and then making that vision a reality. Leto and Hathaway are then seen leading a “WeWork” chant in front of a crowd, emphasizing the almost hypnotic energy of the company and its leaders. The company managed to secure a $47 billion valuation before ultimately plummeting to just $9 billion as the company went public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ1hC4"&gt;The series is based on the &lt;a href="https://wondery.com/shows/we-crashed/"&gt;Wondery podcast &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed: The Rise and Fall of WeWork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is set to debut on Apple TV Plus on March 18th, with new episodes airing every Friday until April 22nd. Last year, Hulu created a documentary that followed the WeWork rollercoaster ride, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22358602/wework-documentary-adam-neumann-hulu"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fe9Z1y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEQP4VVuyrY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwKHAI"&gt;Also coming to Apple TV Plus is &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt;, a series that depicts the ultimate balance between work and home. Adam Scott plays Mark Scout, a manager at Lumon Industries, who undergoes a procedure called “severance.” The procedure splits Scout’s (and his co-workers’) personal and work-related memories — when he’s at the office, he has no memory of his home life and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLrnjA"&gt;The trailer shows what seems to be Scout’s verbal acknowledgment of the procedure’s risks. It also previews the robotic interactions that take place between him and co-workers, as well as hints at a darker mystery brewing inside the workplace. &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt; premieres on February 18th and is produced by Ben Stiller.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s Boost Charge Pro is a $60 MagSafe puck with a kickstand and braided cable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ymzF4VRYu34a_agF_PV6_giTyo=/0x123:1000x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408973/webdam.web.1000.1000.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cable is also a meter longer than Apple’s version.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mbMu6O"&gt;Belkin’s new Boost Charge Pro wireless charging pad takes Apple’s MagSafe puck and ... well, makes it “pro” with a 2-meter-long braided cable and a kickstand for propping your phone up to make it easier to see while it’s charging (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/18/belkin-launches-magsafe-charger-with-kickstand/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It also comes in black, a must for any accessory sporting the pro moniker. There is a bit of a catch, though — like many accessories with official MagSafe certification, it doesn’t come cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BZjfn"&gt;At $60, which it’s listed at in both the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPT72ZM/A/belkin-boost%E2%86%91charge%E2%84%A2-pro-portable-wireless-charger-pad-with-magsafe-special-edition"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fmagsafe-magnetic-accessories%2Fmagsafe%2Fboost-charge-pro-portable-wireless-charger-pad-with-magsafe-15w%2Fp%2Fp-wia004%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F19%2F22890567%2Fbelkin-boost-charge-pro-magsafe-puck-kickstand-braided-cable-expensive-chargers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin&lt;/a&gt; stores, the Boost Charge Pro costs significantly more than &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHXH3AM/A/magsafe-charger?fnode=d76192b5c56e1c17af16d3c4b14699bc630d952cc4a5270eb57358c107d1627abb5684e394d566146208b03ae324c2aaaa5c81a50cc7b3e2458e016fb69760a3460ed0958f075e9ce2c4d0b285230d910e243d7c13efecd8d63a2f62b679a8140b7cb0349a986f62055ef44ac3ff3196"&gt;Apple’s $40 MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;, which was already seen as a bit on the pricy side. Yes, you do get that kickstand, and having a longer cable is definitely a plus. But is it really worth an extra $20, especially considering that you may need to budget for a USB-C charging brick, as it’s not included with either option?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ScN-V7xljU_DRjkbjNT6mJtOjDM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23178248/HPUC2_AV4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll admit it does look good in black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C0BeEF"&gt;This is a familiar story with MagSafe; despite the technology launching with the iPhone 12, MagSafe certified charging accessories aren’t particularly common. Amazon is full of MagSafe &lt;em&gt;compatible &lt;/em&gt;wireless chargers that’ll magnetically attach to your phone (some of them even have a kickstand!), but they’re almost certainly going to max out at 7.5W of charging instead of the 15W that MagSafe affords on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"&gt;non-Mini iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. (It’s also worth noting that some Amazon vendors still advertise their charging pucks as being capable of putting out 15W, but the listings usually&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;admit that number is only achievable on Samsung phones.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jZ55d3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The handful of MagSafe accessories that are out have eye-popping prices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JekqBu"&gt;When manufacturers do come out with MagSafe accessories, the prices are often eye-popping. Perhaps one of the most infamous instances is Belkin’s $40 Car Vent Mount Pro with MagSafe, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22387722/apple-magsafe-belkin-car-vent-mount-pro-review-no-charger"&gt;&lt;em&gt;is not capable of charging your phone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But Belkin is far from the only company putting out pricy MagSafe accessories — &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/18/mophie-magsafe-travel-charger/"&gt;Mophie just announced&lt;/a&gt; a $150 three-in-one travel charging mat that has a MagSafe phone charger, an Apple Watch charging puck, and a (presumably Qi) charger for AirPods. Apple’s own MagSafe Duo Charger, which doesn’t include that extra AirPod pad, will set you back $130. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0fdA8"&gt;Compared to those products, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPP82ZM/A/mophie-3-in-1-stand-for-magsafe-charger?fnode=4e74707df6f53e9bea4a2730e6b91cc8e624a572af1b687dea4d8ba0f88f9a40a92e8c22b7be656ee1ca763cca646e95d9e1d17ce95265d37db2ba9c5e3b330a9dc2ef381460f0e183da6eae69971d7d1867d2eb196a2b5a5488fb315e9486761d4932a636f839dd87b6803cbb5dda19"&gt;Mophie’s $90 three-in-one stand&lt;/a&gt; that’s meant to stay at home almost seems reasonable — except for the fact that you have to bring your own MagSafe puck, putting its price in line with &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPU82ZM/A/belkin-boost%E2%86%91charge%E2%84%A2pro-3-in-1-wireless-charging-pad-with-magsafe?fnode=4e74707df6f53e9bea4a2730e6b91cc8e624a572af1b687dea4d8ba0f88f9a40a92e8c22b7be656ee1ca763cca646e95d9e1d17ce95265d37db2ba9c5e3b330a9dc2ef381460f0e183da6eae69971d7d1867d2eb196a2b5a5488fb315e9486761d4932a636f839dd87b6803cbb5dda19"&gt;Belkin’s similar $150 home charging mat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SuTcSh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A year later, Apple’s MagSafe continues to underwhelm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728967/apple-magsafe-duo-wallet-cases-charging"},{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sVKV2e"&gt;This isn’t to say that MagSafe is bad or that these manufacturers should feel bad. It’s just that over a year since they were first introduced, MagSafe accessories are still quite expensive. And while Belkin’s latest puck doesn’t buck that trend, it is at least nice to have a MagSafe charger with a longer, braided cable that you won’t have to buy a separate stand for. It’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265910/belkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch"&gt;not as cute as Belkin’s charging tree&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue’s four-pack of white ambiance smart bulbs are half off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Philips Hue’s white smart bulbs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u6cAkNAlTZ5Qc8KQvQcRF5i1pGg=/0x63:1500x1063/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407478/PhilipsHue.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Philips Hue’s white smart bulbs have dropped to an all-time low. | Image: Signify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jisN9F"&gt;If you’re looking to light up your home with smart home tech for less, Philips Hue is selling an E26 starter kit containing &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-ambiance-starter-kit-e26/046677530297#specifications" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;four white ambiance smart bulbs and a Hue Bridge for just $59.99 instead of $119.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is an all-time low. These steep discounts come well after Philips Hue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22650951/hue-light-tube-gradient-filament-brighter-bulbs"&gt;launched new 1,100 lumen smart bulbs&lt;/a&gt;, which means it’s likely offering this steep discount on the 800-lumen bulbs looped into this deal until they’re sold out for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMmVIq"&gt;These popular smart bulbs can be customized with adjustable smart timers, and they allow you to set different hues of white light, with a warmer color temperature to help you relax, or a brighter, cleaner color temp to help you focus. You can also pair the bulbs with your existing setup via the Bridge, which uses the Zigbee protocol, thus allowing you to control it all with the most popular smart home ecosystems, including Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, and Amazon’s Alexa. The included Bridge allows you to set lighting routines, control varied scenes, and connect up to 50 lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gpXlSp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10984520"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="TxLqqe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sengled’s newest smart bulb can track your heart rate","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864783/sengled-smart-health-monitoring-smart-bulb-ces2022"},{"title":"All the smart home gadgets worth knowing about from CES 2022 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22870187/smart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vtyYaI"&gt;Whether you travel often, or perhaps you just frequently forget where you placed your keys, Apple’s AirTags can be helpful in a variety of situations. These Ultra Wideband-ready Bluetooth trackers make it easy to monitor and find missing items that they’re attached to by using Apple’s Find My app, which taps into the expansive Find My network, allowing any iOS device within range to send the location of your AirTag to you. Each tracker has the ability to make a chirping sound when requested, and its user-replaceable battery should last for up to a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWF5NC"&gt;Unfortunately, like most Apple products, they’re usually a little costly, which is why today’s modest discount on a four-pack is notable. Typically $99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532AM-A-AirTag/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling four AirTags for $94&lt;/a&gt;. It usually costs $29 for each AirTag, so with this deal, you’re spending about $24 per tracker instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="05MRqr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873581"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nop9oI"&gt;For those on the market for a security camera deal, Arlo makes some good-quality devices — one of which is $120 cheaper today. Arlo’s $599.99 Ultra 2 Spotlight wireless security system &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HRSWY37?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is on sale at Amazon for $479.99&lt;/a&gt;, matching its best price to date. The deal includes two security cameras that run on rechargeable batteries and boast an ultra-wide 180-degree lens, which can zoom into objects and record video in 4K with HDR. Other notable features include free local storage from the Arlo Smart hub, colorized night vision, two-way audio, a siren, and support for HomeKit, Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DnSCzW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10984187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="XsMB0x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The secret weapons in Arlo’s new security system are the all-in-one sensors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="g15Le5"&gt;If you’re still resolved to get fit this year but missed out on one of the great smartwatch deals after New Year’s, it looks like you have another shot. Amazon is once again selling the Apple Watch Series 7 at its best price ever. Regularly $399, the green, 41mm GPS model and its matching Sport Band are selling for $339 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HF1DC1J/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrIjyP2Ouw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $60. Best Buy is also throwing in an additional month of Apple Fitness Plus with each purchase. Compared to the previous generation, the Series 7 boasts a larger display than its predecessor, and features IP6X dust and water resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bvNuzB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VCyaQB"&gt;Gamers shopping for a new entry-level wireless mouse can get a swell deal on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CMS5Q6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s G305 Lightspeed in black for just $32.42 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (normally $49.99). That’s just $3 shy of its best price ever and a 35 percent total discount on the lightweight mouse, which sports six programmable buttons, a 12K DPI sensor, and built-in USB receiver storage so you can easily stow it when you need to take it on the go. The peripheral, Logitech claims, is also capable of lasting up to 250 hours on a single AA battery. If you’re not a fan of the black colorway, the white model is on sale for $39.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CMS5Q6N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrJ9Pj6Egg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s5IihW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10821865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Smixhg"&gt;Here are some other great tech products you can save on today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8z2tx6"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling the standard edition of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrLXaEfFlf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; for Nintendo Switch for just $37.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $56.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hqn2yC"&gt;If you’re on the market for an affordable, basic smart 4K TV, Best Buy is selling the 55-inch configuration of TCL’s 5-Series QLED TV for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrLTrOrt6G" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 instead of $649.99&lt;/a&gt; right now. The retailer is also offering additional perks with each purchase, including a $50 discount on a Google Nest Hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wokii9"&gt;As the Senate Judiciary Committee inches towards passing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726897/amazon-apple-google-app-stores-marketplace-antitrust-competition-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;legislation that could loosen Big Tech’s grasp on consumers&lt;/a&gt;, Big Tech is expectedly outraged. Both Apple and Google have written letters publicly opposing new pieces of legislation, while a coalition of smaller tech companies has voiced their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEN952"&gt;The outcry comes in response to two pieces of proposed legislation: &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3816/text?r=8&amp;amp;s=1"&gt;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents Big Tech from favoring their services over others, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;Open App Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to promote competition on app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oN5xKr"&gt;Apple’s senior director of government affairs, Tim Powderly, penned a letter, viewed by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-IL), Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the panel’s ranking Republican, Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and the subcommittee’s ranking Republican, Mike Lee (R-UT), criticizing the legislation. Powderly says the bills, particularly the Open App Markets Act, would be detrimental to the safety of the App Store, as it would allow users to sideload apps, also known as downloading an app from a third-party source. Since these apps exist outside of the Apple ecosystem, they aren’t subject to the same &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/app-security-overview-sec35dd877d0/web"&gt;safety and security standards&lt;/a&gt; that apps must meet to earn a spot on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eKpApl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cChANh"&gt;“After a tumultuous year that witnessed multiple controversies regarding social media, whistle-blower allegations of long-ignored risks to children, and ransomware attacks that hobbled critical infrastructure, it would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices,” Powderly writes. “Unfortunately, that is what these bills would do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLt3Dx"&gt;Downloading an app from outside the App Store wouldn’t subject them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users choose the kinds of data (if any) that apps are allowed to track. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tim-cook-claims-sideloading-apps-would-destroy-security-and-privacy-of-ios/"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook said&lt;/a&gt; sideloading “would destroy the security of the iPhone and a lot of the privacy initiatives that we’ve built into the App Store where we have privacy nutrition labels and app tracking transparency, where it forces people to get permission to track across apps.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761724/apple-craig-federighi-ios-sideloading-web-summit-2021-european-commission-digital-markets-act"&gt;Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi has spoken out against sideloading&lt;/a&gt; as well, stating that it “undermines security and puts people’s data at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14OBO7"&gt;It’s also worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;Apple currently collects a 15 to 30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; on any in-app purchases on apps downloaded from its App Store. The company prevents developers from incorporating alternate payment processors for this very reason, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the prevailing issue behind the Epic v. Apple case&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/15/22885065/apple-netherlands-dating-apps-third-party-payment-options"&gt;Apple recently conceded to the Dutch government&lt;/a&gt; to allow dating app developers to include other payment options, however, the company says it will still take a commission from those purchases, and it’s unclear how much that commission will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GqMZTP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says the legislation could harm “US technological leadership” by giving Americans “worse” and “less relevant” products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hC6OJa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/the-harmful-consequences-of-congresss-anti-tech-bills/"&gt;In its own post&lt;/a&gt;, Google made a similar case against the “legislation being debated in the House and Senate,” arguing it would not be able to offer the “best” services to consumers if the antitrust laws pass. Since the American Innovation and Choice Online Act would prevent Google from prioritizing its own services ahead of others, the company claims it may not be able to offer consumers the best online experience, as users may be swayed by other apps that apparently just aren’t as good as Google’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8AVll"&gt;The company says the legislation could harm “US technological leadership” by giving Americans “worse, less relevant, and less helpful versions of products like Google Search and Maps.” Google also claims it would prevent the company from integrating security features into its apps and services by default, such as its SafeBrowsing service and spam filters in Gmail and Chrome, which block pop-ups, viruses, and malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvQINa"&gt;“We believe that updating technology regulations in areas like privacy, AI, and protections for kids and families could provide real benefits. But breaking our products wouldn’t address any of these issues,” Kent Walker, the president of global affairs and chief legal officer at Google and Alphabet explains. “Instead, it would eliminate helpful features, expose people to new privacy and security risks, and weaken America’s technological leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtGU9O"&gt;Like Apple, Google also charges developers a 15 to 30 percent commission on apps and in-app purchases. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;Dozens of states filed lawsuits against the company&lt;/a&gt; last year, citing that the practice violated antitrust policies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;Epic Games also sued Google in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the company’s payment restrictions on the Play Store constitute a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="exa816"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Dominant technology companies can: use manipulative design tactics to steer individuals away from rival services”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PTLa9I"&gt;But there are still several other voices, albeit a bit smaller than Apple and Google, voicing their support of the legislation. Companies including Wyze, Yelp, DuckDuckGo, and the Tor Project, &lt;a href="https://wesupportsb2992.medium.com/re-s-2992-the-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act-f49cc61abd87"&gt;posted a letter&lt;/a&gt; urging Chairman Durbin and ranking Republican Grassley to vote “yes” on the American Innovation and Choice Online Act. The companies say that Big Tech’s dominance and “gatekeeper status” have prevented them “from competing on the merits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYeU3J"&gt;“Dominant technology companies can: use manipulative design tactics to steer individuals away from rival services; restrict the ability of competitors to interoperate on the platform; use non-public data to benefit the companies’ own services or products; make it impossible or complicated for users to change their default settings or services or uninstall apps,” the letter states. “These tactics not only harm competition, but also deprive consumers of the innovative offerings a vibrant market would yield.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7XW71"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549025/big-tech-antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google-house-judiciary-jim-jordan"&gt;the House Judiciary Committee passed a package of six similar antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt;, none of which have become law. The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to review the bipartisan American Innovation and Choice Online act later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple digital keys reportedly coming to some Hyundai cars this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Launch Of Hyundai Motor Company’s All-New Genesis In Seoul" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfdEivnIMZV3kc1Edqsn1Bhzhyg=/95x0:2906x1874/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399186/452075859.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyundai’s Genesis cars could soon get access to the feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WTe4XF"&gt;Hyundai and its Genesis brand are reportedly close to adding support for Apple’s digital car key feature, which lets you unlock and start compatible vehicles using the iPhone’s Wallet app, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-01-16/what-will-apple-aapl-call-its-new-ar-vr-headset-apple-vision-apple-reality-kyhmibia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;. According to Gurman, the so-called “CarKey” feature is set to come to Hyundai’s Genesis lineup this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOF2SK"&gt;Hyundai already offers proprietary iOS apps, including &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myhyundai-with-bluelink/id893514610"&gt;MyHyundai with Bluelink&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genesis-intelligent-assistant/id867941329"&gt;Genesis Intelligent Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, which include the ability to remotely start, or unlock the doors of compatible vehicles. But adding support for Apple’s implementation of the digital key feature should make the functionality more seamless, and benefit from system-level Apple Wallet shortcuts. &lt;a href="https://owners.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/resources/technology-and-navigation/frequently-asked-questions-about-hyundai-digital-key.html"&gt;Hyundai’s site&lt;/a&gt; notes that its NFC-based digital key feature is currently only available on Android phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JdaKwA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;References to Hyundai have previously been discovered in iOS code&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MnE6MA"&gt;Apple first announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;digital car key feature in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but so far it’s only available on select BMW models. Reports that it would be coming to Hyundai’s cars date back to at least January 2021 when &lt;a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=58446"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Korea&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the plans, and reference’s to Hyundai’s Genesis cars &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/genesis-digital-car-keys-code/"&gt;have also been discovered in iOS 15 code&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbuKMs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t specify whether Hyundai plans to make use of recent iPhones’ ultra wideband (UWB) technology, which could allow owners to unlock their car without having to take their phone out of their pocket, or whether it will just use NFC. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;BMW previously announced&lt;/a&gt; the feature for its all-electric iX, relying on the U1 chip found in the iPhone 11 and later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dGDqG"&gt;Apple and Hyundai were previously rumored to be in discussions to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;produce an electric car together&lt;/a&gt;. Hyundai later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271748/hyundai-apple-car-talks-stopped-report"&gt;downplayed these rumors&lt;/a&gt;, and said it was no longer in talks with the iPhone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Safari 15 bug can leak your recent browsing activity and personal identifiers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q-QZjSU3L78a6LZ3zw-_6BJ96aI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70397170/acastro_200207_3900_Safari_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XYwPrx"&gt;A bug in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;Safari 15&lt;/a&gt; can leak your browsing activity, and can also reveal some of the personal information attached to your Google account, according to &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/indexeddb-api-browser-vulnerability-safari-15/"&gt;findings from FingerprintJS&lt;/a&gt;, a browser fingerprinting and fraud detection service (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/16/safari-bug-leak-browsing-history-info/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The vulnerability stems from an issue with Apple’s implementation of &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API"&gt;IndexedDB&lt;/a&gt;, an application programming interface (API) that stores data on your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQC8Ia"&gt;As explained by FingerprintJS, IndexedDB abides by the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy"&gt;same-origin policy&lt;/a&gt;, which restricts one origin from interacting with data that was collected on other origins — essentially, only the website that generates data can access it. For example, if you open your email account in one tab and then open a malicious webpage in another, the same-origin policy prevents the malicious page from viewing and meddling with your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ixhif6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s not much you can do to get around the issue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IhMBJI"&gt;FingerprintJS found that Apple’s application of the IndexedDB API in Safari 15 actually violates the same-origin policy. When a website interacts with a database in Safari, FingerprintJS says that “a new (empty) database with the same name is created in all other active frames, tabs, and windows within the same browser session.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHR6w5"&gt;This means other websites can see the name of other databases created on other sites, which could contain details specific to your identity. FingerprintJS notes sites that use your Google account, like YouTube, Google Calendar, and Google Keep, all generate databases with your unique Google User ID in its name. Your Google User ID allows Google to access your publicly-available information, such as your profile picture, which the Safari bug can expose to other websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1FgUpg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a huge bug. On OSX, Safari users can (temporarily) switch to another browser to avoid their data leaking across origins. iOS users have no such choice, because Apple imposes a ban on other browser engines. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aXdhDVIjTT"&gt;https://t.co/aXdhDVIjTT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1482627132903858176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9bYMxQ"&gt;FingerprintJS created &lt;a href="https://safarileaks.com/"&gt;a proof-of-concept demo&lt;/a&gt; you can try out if you have Safari 15 and above on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. The demo uses the browser’s IndexedDB vulnerability to identify the sites you have open (or opened recently), and shows how sites that exploit the bug can scrape information from your Google User ID. It currently only detects 30 popular sites that are affected by the bug, such as include Instagram, Netflix, Twitter, Xbox, but it likely affects far more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="St7eCX"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s not much you can do to get around the issue, as FingerprintJS says the bug also affects Private Browsing mode on Safari. You can use a different browser on macOS, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;Apple’s third-party browser engine ban on iOS&lt;/a&gt; means all browsers are affected. FingerprintJS reported the leak to the WebKit Bug Tracker on November 28th, but there hasn’t been an update to Safari yet. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will now require employees to submit proof of COVID-19 booster shot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store cube stock 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nbql_Y8lQk52pmKhPsCxgYqN-xw=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70394216/theverge3_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0bPp0"&gt;Apple now requires store and corporate employees to get a COVID-19 booster shot, the company announced in an internal email seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8JQJu"&gt;Once an employee is eligible to get a booster shot, they will have four weeks to comply, otherwise, they will need to take frequent tests to enter a retail store, partner store, or Apple office starting on February 15th. Apple will require unvaccinated employees — or those who haven’t yet submitted proof of vaccination — to provide negative COVID-19 rapid antigen tests before entering the workplace beginning on January 24th, although it’s unclear whether this applies to both corporate and retail employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8RVbxv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple boosts safety protocols as the omicron variant spreads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mILrja"&gt;“Due to waning efficacy of the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines and the emergence of highly transmissible variants such as Omicron, a booster shot is now part of staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccination to protect against severe disease,” Apple states in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgxOlg"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;Apple asked that unvaccinated corporate employees take daily tests&lt;/a&gt; before entering the office, with unvaccinated retail workers testing twice per week. The company also began requiring vaccinated individuals to take COVID-19 tests once every week, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679772/apple-vaccine-policy-covid-19-testing-unvaccinated"&gt;lowered the frequency of these tests&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that Apple’s “infrequent” testing policy no longer applies to employees who don’t receive the booster shot by Apple’s deadline, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sp61V"&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877332/meta-facebook-require-employees-covid-19-booster-vaccine-shot-return-office-reopening"&gt;Meta said employees will need to get a COVID-19 booster shot&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the company’s return to in-office work in March. While Google hasn’t mandated company-wide booster shots yet, it requires employees to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work"&gt;have the first two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884539/google-require-negative-molecular-test-covid-19-offices"&gt;take weekly molecular tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will let dating apps offer third-party payment options in the Netherlands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-G1OIsdNoZpjEYYJ4rTZp7cd0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393949/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oc0YNi"&gt;Apple will let dating app developers offer alternate payment options in the Netherlands in compliance with the Dutch regulator’s ruling, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-15/apple-will-add-additional-payment-options-for-dutch-dating-apps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow dating apps — and only dating apps — distributed in the country to potentially avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;Apple’s 15 to 30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; on in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSHZQL"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mbbs4zql"&gt;a message to developers on its site&lt;/a&gt;, Apple explains that it’s introducing two new optional “entitlements,” or specific app capabilities, that will let developers add third-party payment processors for dating apps in the Netherlands. Dating app developers can either direct customers to a website to complete their purchase or add a third-party payment service within the app. However, if developers choose to snub Apple’s payment service in favor of an alternative, Apple says it won’t be able to help users with refunds, subscription management, or any payment issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1ZtqF"&gt;There’s another, more concerning caveat, though — any developers that want to add alternate payment options will have to create a separate version of the dating app only available in the Netherlands, as noted on &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/"&gt;a developer support page&lt;/a&gt;. Apple will still charge dating apps a commission for using external payment processors, but it’s unclear how much it will be. “Dating apps that are granted an entitlement to link out or use a third-party in-app payment provider will pay Apple a commission on transactions,” Apple writes. “More information on all aspects of the entitlements will be available shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rEFNMv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests, we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWesu1"&gt;Apple has also appealed the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets’ (ACM) decision. “Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests, we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court,” Apple explains. “We’re concerned these changes could compromise the user experience, and create new threats to user privacy and data security. In the meantime, we are obligated to make the mandated changes which we’re launching today and we will provide further information shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K53ogY"&gt;In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852966/apple-netherlands-dating-apps-match-tinder-app-store-competition"&gt;the ACM ruled that Apple allow dating apps in the country to offer third-party payment services&lt;/a&gt;, and if the company failed to do so by January 15th, it would face a 5 million Euro-per-week fine. The &lt;a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-launches-investigation-abuse-dominance-apple-its-app-store"&gt;ACM began its investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s payment rules in 2019, concentrating specifically on dating apps following a complaint from Match Group, which owns popular online dating services Match.com, Tinder, OkCupid, and Hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHp9Z3"&gt;Apple’s payment policies have stirred up controversy across the globe, with South Korea introducing legislation that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22877952/apple-third-party-payments-app-store-south-korea"&gt;requires the company to allow in-app third-party payment services&lt;/a&gt;. Its restriction on alternate payment services is also the catalyst behind the ongoing battle between Epic Games and Apple — a court order that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;forces Apple to allow external payment options&lt;/a&gt; was just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;put on hold after an appeal from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, Apple made a small compromise and agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;let “reader” apps point customers to external sites&lt;/a&gt; for subscription signups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JHLAM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 4:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added clarification that Apple will require developers to create a separate app binary specific to the Netherlands in order to use third-party payment services, and that it will still take a commission on transactions that use external payment processors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s excellent Basilisk V3 mouse is selling for its best price ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Basilisk V3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93zvcK6thr59E8heEEsXStf-ij4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393670/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Basilisk V3 is on sale at Amazon today for just $59.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sEIbpk"&gt;We’re starting the weekend with some exciting news for gamers: our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;pick for the best wired gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; is now available for its lowest price to date. For only the third time, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming/dp/B09C13PZX7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling Razer’s Basilisk V3 for just $59.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $69.99. The comfortable mouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;delivers notable improvements&lt;/a&gt; over its predecessor, particularly in regards to its scroll wheel. Depending upon how hard your scroll, the mouse can switch between ridged scrolling and free-spin modes, which make it easier to scroll down the page more freely — a perk that comes in handy even if you’re not using the mouse for gaming. It also touts a 26K DPI sensor, RGB lighting, and 11 programmable buttons, so you can adjust the controls to your liking within Razer’s Synapse software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wjkAwO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ChiQ"&gt;If you’re on the market for a pair of affordable true wireless earbuds, today we’re seeing some great discounts on both the new Jabra Elite 3 earbuds &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Jabra’s older Elite 75t. Already considered Jabra’s budget buds, the Elite 3 typically retail for $79.99 but are on sale today for $59.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Built/dp/B09B45T59G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVt4AzUUic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Chris Welch praised the earbuds, noting that they sound better than he expected given their price. He was also impressed by their performance, decent call quality, no-fuss controls, and lengthy battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTXNHE"&gt;However, if you’re looking for wireless earbuds that offer features like noise cancellation, the $149.99 Elite 75t are also on sale at Best Buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp0dUvFa7T" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $79.99&lt;/a&gt;, which nearly matches their best price to date. While the noise cancellation on these isn’t quite as good as it is on the newer &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/26374473.5227/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxNTQ5NTg3L2phYnJhLWVsaXRlLTg1dC1yZXZpZXctZmVhdHVyZXMtc3BlY3MtcHJpY2U/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb3df85a2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t&lt;/a&gt;, they both boast excellent sound with a good amount of bass. The Elite 75t are also comfortable and capable of connecting to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, a feature still not commonly found in many wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Elite 75t review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="pPy4Pw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XILdnP"&gt;Shifting from wireless earbuds to high-quality microphones, the $129.99 Blue Yeti mic is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in select colors for $99.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp5KfMrnfX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;; this includes the black model, which Amazon hasn’t discounted since July. While not its best price ever, this is the lowest we’ve seen the mic sell for since the holidays. A popular staple with podcasters, YouTubers, and Twitch streamers, the Yeti is capable of conforming to a number of different recording environments. It also allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio, rendering it one of the more versatile budget options out there for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lggHuR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-4643279180604848904ZHRjPs"&gt;DJI’s Mavic Mini remains one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best drones you can buy for under $500&lt;/a&gt;, however, $450 is still a lot of money. Thankfully, if you’re looking for something more affordable, its 2019 predecessor is available today at Newegg with a handful of accessories. Right now, you can buy the last-gen &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=TheVergeDailyDeals1152022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F380-0002-00345" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI Mavic Mini Fly More Combo for just $299.99&lt;/a&gt;, a solid $100 discount. The bundle includes three sets of spare propellers, a carrying bag, a propeller guard, a gimbal protector, spare batteries, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-4643279180604848904Y1gSCr"&gt;Despite the fact the Mavic Mini is an older, more budget-friendly drone, it still shares many features in common with more expensive models, like a number of creative shooting modes and the ability to automatically return to its takeoff spot. It also doesn’t require FAA registration, a boon for experienced drone pilots and newcomers alike. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938530/dji-mavic-mini-price-specs-faa-ultra-light-combo-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mEkTeZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T07o9o"&gt;Some other ways to save this weekend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AWG8HQ"&gt;If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, Amazon is selling a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online Family Membership and a SanDisk 128GB Micro SD card for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BT4MTZS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just $34.99 (nearly $40 off&lt;/a&gt;), giving you a way to game online and expand your console’s storage space at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZwVNY7"&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods are still selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at the low price of $139.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. They originally sold for $179.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h5OXiV"&gt;Lenovo’s Smart Clock 2 with a built-in wireless charging pad &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgqmnNTjMYj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $64.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, down from $89.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The best noise-canceling headphone deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8ZQ6F2601Vo7AEwFugPl0G63SE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70392555/bfarsace_190903_3639_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless 3 headphones are just $241 instead of $399.99 at Adorama.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2yBGHO"&gt;With many people working from home than they used to, owning a good pair of noise-canceling headphones has become more appealing than ever. However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4B19IV"&gt;That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a buying decision, we’ve put together a guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L17MDv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFH8rh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10961832"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4 are the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GSgzPh"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XtIOrp"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 is our overall pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. They offer excellent noise-canceling, good sound and voice quality, and the ability to pair to two devices simultaneously. You can wear these for long periods of time as well, as their plush ear pads make them comfortable to wear for as long as you need. They can even last up to 30 hours on a single charge and can be charged via USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRoMJX"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the $349.99 headphones drop to $248 — their lowest price to date. They remained around that price throughout the holiday season, but, unfortunately, many retailers have since ended their sales. Some retailers, however, are offering bundle deals that are still worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE9AC9"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?subId1=TheVergeBestNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; is bundling the WH-1000XM4 with a 20,800mAh battery pack and a microfiber cleaning cloth for $348. Mophie’s power bank typically sells for $39.95, so this bundle is valued at around $390. If you don’t care for the battery pack or prefer to shop elsewhere, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863FR3S9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1582549-REG%2Fsony_wh1000xm4_b_wh_1000xm4_wireless_noise_canceling_over_ear.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the headphones for $348. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max is a good pick for those deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Yu5lCJ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UfClp3"&gt;If you’re looking for the best sound quality you can get in a pair of noise-canceling headphones, we recommend the AirPods Max. The headphones pair seamlessly with other Apple devices and sound superb, especially combined with Apple’s surround sound-like Spatial Audio feature, which allows for a more immersive experience when listening to or watching select content. They also tout the best transparency mode of all the headphones on our list while boasting incredible build quality thanks to a luxe design that takes opts for aluminum, steel, and fabric over plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqkx5j"&gt;At $549, these headphones are expensive, but we’ve been seeing a lot of discounts lately.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation Sennheiser Momentum Wireless headphones sound great and integrate with Tile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CZefdO"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j2k0rf"&gt;If you’re a non-Apple user looking for a pair of noise-canceling headphones that sound fantastic, Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless 3 is your best option. We found that they boast detailed, bass-rich sound, a stylish, retro-inspired design, and are extremely comfortable to wear — even when you’re donning glasses. Although their noise cancellation might not rival other models on our list, they make up for it with convenient software features like ambient passthrough and a customizable EQ. Plus, unlike many other headphones, they integrate with the location tracking device, Tile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TshVIF"&gt;The headphones typically retail for $399.99, but several retailers have been selling them for $241 since Black Friday. Right now, however, only &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107512/1036?subId1=TheVergeNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fse508234.html"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; has them for $241 (and only in black). That’s nearly half their usual price, saving you $159. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2 are great for multitasking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1HLSET"&gt;Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wB7ybM"&gt;Multitaskers will appreciate Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2 as they offer terrific, reliable multipoint Bluetooth support. You can seamlessly pair them with multiple devices, allowing you to juggle content and switch back and forth at the same time. These headphones also offer intuitive dial controls for volume and noise cancellation, with far better quality and battery life than their predecessor. While the noise canceling isn’t quite as effective as Bose’s and Sony’s, they still adequately silence outside noises so you can focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slxuWB"&gt;During Black Friday, Microsoft’s $249.99 Surface Headphones 2 dropped down to $162.49, which is almost half their typical retail price. We’re not currently seeing any similar big deals on them, but you can still a pair for $230.99 from &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-headphones-2%2F8WQ0BSX7G523%2FCS2R%3FOCID%3D%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/619711/9383?subId1=TheVergeNCHeadphones142022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Headphones-2-Black-Wireless%2F226974951&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEW-Microsoft-Surface-Headphones-Matte/dp/B086QCFRQ5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Note, however, the deal available from Walmart is sold and shipped by Microsoft. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267032/microsoft-surface-headphones-2-review-noise-canceling-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt; Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700 boast excellent voice quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7hB20N"&gt;Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl2BaG"&gt;If you plan to frequently use your headphones for voice calls, Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are the best option on this list for doing so. They boast excellent voice call quality, meaning everybody on your Zoom call will be able to hear you loud and clearly, and they offer great noise cancellation with satisfactory sound. Like the QC45, the over-ears can also connect to two devices simultaneously, but they can’t be folded and only offer 20 hours of battery life, which is also less than other headphones on this list provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FueOFu"&gt;We’ve seen several discounts on the 700s over the past year or so, with the best reaching an all-time low of $299. Lately, however, we haven’t seen any sales that steep. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X5F81JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has been selling them for $379&lt;/a&gt; instead of $399 for the past six months, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-11556694?sid=TheVergeNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fheadphones%2Fnoise_cancelling_headphones%2Fnoise-cancelling-headphones-700.html%23v%3Dnoise_cancelling_headphones_700_black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoJJjLU8c0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are currently selling the headphones for the same price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Studio 3 are nearly half off and thus a good alternative if you’re looking for a more budget-friendly pair of headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eO1gZ8"&gt;Beats Studio 3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4X0vv8"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we couldn’t recommend&lt;/a&gt; these to anybody outside of the Apple ecosystem, the Beats Studio 3 Wireless could be a decent alternative if you want a pair of over-ear headphones from Apple but find the AirPods Max to be too expensive. The Beats Studio 3 are comfortable to wear, fold inward for easy stowing, and feature Apple’s last-gen W1 wireless chip, which allows you to quickly connect and switch between Apple devices. Note, however, unlike those built with Apple’s newer H1 chip, the headphones lack hands-free Siri support. They also charge via a Micro USB port instead of a Lightning port or USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJn2Mp"&gt;They’re certainly showing their age at this point — they launched 2017, after all — but they're currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio3-Wireless-Headphones-Collection/dp/B08528ZCNX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale starting at $199 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in select colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Like newer Bose models, the QuietComfort 35 II are both comfortable and lightweight. They also come with a number of praiseworthy features, including good sound quality and the ability to seamlessly switch between two paired devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lint85"&gt;While their sticker price is $349, the QC35 II are frequently on sale for far less. In fact, until just recently, we saw them for as low as $179. Right now, however, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1227753/2092?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals122021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is only selling the headphones for around $299, about $30 less than Bose QC45 are currently selling for.&lt;/p&gt;

While its sticker price was $299.95, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp7ZJWzFZK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling them in blue and red for $199.99&lt;/a&gt;.

As a result, Apple no longer sells them, and the retailers that do — like Best Buy — are not likely to continue stocking them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
