    <title>Of course repairing the new Apple TV remote is harder than simply unscrewing it</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lMycCY"&gt;Apple, a company notorious for making its products difficult to repair, has given us a real head-scratcher of a repair situation with its next-generation streaming remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxu4M8"&gt;At issue here are a pair of screws that would appear to make repair semi-straightforward but absolutely do not. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-AmXttNmqA"&gt;iFixit tore down&lt;/a&gt; the second-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which will ship with the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; streaming box, and found that these two screws on the outside of the remote do basically nothing. Do not, in other words, expect to be able to fix your new remote or its battery easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1xfRQ"&gt;First off, Apple’s new wand features a one-piece &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-unveils-the-next-generation-of-apple-tv-4k%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F26%2F22455294%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-ifixit-teardown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;aluminum outer casing&lt;/a&gt; design — meaning that while minimal and pretty, this thing was probably already going to prove difficult to tinker with. You might think, therefore, that a pair of tiny screws at the bottom of the remote near its charging port would offer easy access to the thing most likely to need to be repaired on this remote: the battery. You would be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bflUJ0BqVtj70FwQYOsJ7UUuB2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529634/DSCF3938.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The previous generation of Siri Remote (left) shown next to the newer remote (right). The newer remote has two tiny screws at the bottom. They do nothing.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZBXF0"&gt;Instead, iFixit’s video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-AmXttNmqA"&gt;teardown indicated&lt;/a&gt; that the tiny plate that covers its Lightning port — another Siri Remote sin, if I’m being honest — effectively goes nowhere. To get inside the remote, iFixit needed to use a handful of specialized tools to pop off the buttons on the remote, remove more tiny screws and tiny component parts, wriggle the remote’s inner frame out of its aluminum shell, unscrew the logic board from the remote’s skeleton, and finally, pop out the 1.52Wh battery. Oh, and its cables are soldered together with those of the Lightning port, making DIY repairs all the more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AZ5q0"&gt;Is the lack of simple repairability on the next-generation Siri Remote entirely surprising? Well, no. Of course not. Repairing the first-generation Siri wand was similarly a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14Tz1DWIX4"&gt;whole entire thing&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is also notorious for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/microsoft-and-apple-wage-war-on-gadget-right-to-repair-laws"&gt;lobbying against&lt;/a&gt; right-to-repair legislation, has been shown to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348240/apple-right-to-repair-legislation-antitrust-investigation-policy"&gt;internally conflicted&lt;/a&gt; about its own position on the matter, and has used &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/right-to-repair-is-less-complicated-and-more-important-1834672055"&gt;bad-faith arguments&lt;/a&gt; to shield itself from criticism about how difficult its products are to fix, particularly where it relates to proprietary component parts and repair instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEZug1"&gt;But for a remote with a rechargeable battery, Apple sure makes it difficult to actually get in there and access one of the things most likely to need replacement down the road. And tricking us with a pair of screws that do little for repairability doesn’t exactly curry favor on the repair front, either.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV 4K (2021) review: much better remote, slightly faster box</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A new chip and some futureproofing, but no huge changes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NA4uQ5"&gt;It’s easy to be underwhelmed by the new Apple TV 4K. It looks identical to Apple’s first 4K streaming box introduced back in 2017, and the day-to-day experience of using it doesn’t feel dramatically better when compared to that device. The biggest improvement is undoubtedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;the redesigned second-generation Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; that comes bundled with the new Apple TV 4K — but you can buy that separately for $59. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEtUqm"&gt;Those who have long sung the Apple TV’s praises will find more to like with this updated hardware. It now has Wi-Fi 6 for speedier, more robust wireless performance. (A gigabit ethernet jack remains on the back for wired connectivity.) Apple has also built in support for Thread, the smart home networking protocol that will &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; be widely supported across the industry — even if it’s good for relatively little right now. The biggest internal change in the latest model is an upgraded chipset: Apple has moved on from the A10X Fusion to the A12 Bionic. But the A12 is far from Apple’s latest and greatest silicon; it first appeared in the iPhone XS line in 2018 and is still currently used in the entry-level iPad and iPad Mini. It’s an improvement, but not some game-changer for Apple’s set-top box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iLMSp1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10519883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JxET4M"&gt;On the outside, the Apple TV 4K is impossible to distinguish from its predecessor. It’s still the same nondescript black box that calls little attention to itself on a TV stand. I wish Apple would have done away with the glossy, dust-magnet sides, but we’re not so lucky. The company is sticking with the traditional set-top box form factor even as many competitors have moved to more discreet HDMI dongles that are usually hidden from view behind the TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQl3xb"&gt;There have also been more subtle technical improvements that aren’t being advertised, but it’s the type of stuff video nerds will notice. Apple has mostly resolved an issue with &lt;a href="https://www.avsforum.com/threads/apple-tv-4k-raised-dolby-vision-black-levels-fixed-on-2021-model-near-black-sdr-flickering.3183975/"&gt;raised blacks in Dolby Vision content&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3fH-v9NwKQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HDTVTest’s&lt;/em&gt; Vincent Teoh&lt;/a&gt;. However, the 2021 Apple TV 4K still doesn’t support bitstream audio passthrough, so the company hasn’t addressed all the wants of home theater enthusiasts. But it’s still checking off the essentials like Dolby Vision, Atmos, and HDR10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgrrI1"&gt;The tvOS software experience is identical between this Apple TV 4K and its predecessor. Navigating through menus and Siri voice searches both come with an extra dash of speed, and apps seem to load faster than before. But the differences are often marginal; the 2017 Apple TV 4K still holds up well today in terms of performance. That’s largely because tvOS is very polished at this point, and it doesn’t cheapen the viewing experience with in-your-face ads or sponsored content. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEEcVIBgXK-1bw4weScVml5NO6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529635/DSCF3939.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV’s home screen is still a basic grid of apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IWcyDj"&gt;The Apple TV’s home screen is still the same old static grid of apps, and Apple does what it can to steer you into using its Apple TV app, which aggregates TV shows and movies from numerous services and is also where you’ll find Apple TV Plus originals. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; is coming back soon, in case Apple hasn’t hammered that message into your brain enough already. The Apple TV app is fine and more than competent at recommendations (provided you aren’t looking for anything from Netflix), but aside from the Apple TV Plus section, it hasn’t changed a whole lot and feels stuck in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJPTKZ"&gt;Thankfully, Apple has evolved and added to tvOS elsewhere in recent years with new features like multiuser support, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and HomePod home theater audio. Speaking of which, the new Apple TV 4K lets you play audio through any HDMI device through the original HomePod. I don’t have Apple’s speakers around to try this myself, but early reports suggest that ARC audio works fine for video content. However, latency might be a dealbreaker if you attempt gaming with HomePods as speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKksQG"&gt;Another new trick of tvOS that’s also available on older Apple TV devices is an automatic calibration feature that uses your iPhone’s camera to process color patterns on-screen and adjust the image to make it look as good as possible. This doesn’t actually alter any of your TV’s settings; the Apple TV is optimizing its own picture settings, and you can toggle between this calibrated “balanced” result and the default to see the difference. The consensus seems to be that Apple’s feature can lead to improvements — often producing a warmer image — though most higher-end TVs come with accurate settings out of the box, especially in cinema or calibrated mode. If you’re serious about picture quality, it’s worth doing a legitimate calibration to get the best outcome across all of your TV’s various inputs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxuJOq-o28fiEPHDe-8suVrAQzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541099/DSCF3862_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Apple TV 4K looks identical to the first model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fCFbWZ"&gt;As before, the second-gen Apple TV 4K can serve as &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207057"&gt;a hub for your HomeKit accessories&lt;/a&gt;; having a hub lets you control those devices remotely when you’re out of the house. When you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; home, you can quickly access smart home gadgets or pull up camera feeds on-screen with a voice command on the Apple TV 4K. Apple has also included Thread, a wireless communication standard developed specifically for smart home purposes, in the new Apple TV 4K, allowing it to be a hub for Thread devices to connect to and access the internet through. Thread should lead to more reliable connections and faster response times between devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;that support the protocol&lt;/a&gt;; Apple also built it into the HomePod Mini, and it’s the basis of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;forthcoming multiplatform Matter standard&lt;/a&gt;. But other tricks that were once selling points of the Apple TV, like AirPlay, can now be found on many smart TVs and even Roku devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="cmMRnq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10519994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eE5sVw"&gt;Video streams on the Apple TV 4K still deliver exceptional quality, but some of the frustrations we mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;nearly four years ago&lt;/a&gt; still remain present in tvOS today. Apple has long enabled the box to match the dynamic range and frame rate of playing content, but not all apps have taken advantage of this feature. So if your preference in video settings is Dolby Vision with dynamic range matching enabled, you’ll still encounter some situations where SDR content looks unappealing due to forced HDR processing. (There’s also a strange bug on the new Apple TV 4K where &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/new-apple-tv-4k-lists-hd-content-incorrectly/"&gt;some movies are being labeled as “HD”&lt;/a&gt; — even when it’s very clear that a 4K file is being streamed.) Setting tvOS to SDR by default with matching enabled leads to the best outcome, though YouTube annoyingly doesn’t flip over to HDR if you do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtY08y"&gt;Live TV integration with Siri remains &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204181"&gt;limited to a frustratingly small list of providers and apps&lt;/a&gt;, though at least ESPN is there. I’d love to see tvOS offer deeper support for live TV apps like Sling TV, YouTube TV, and Hulu with Live TV beyond including them in single sign-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hT0KeV"&gt;One argument that Apple TV owners frequently make in support of the hardware’s premium cost is that they appreciate Apple’s stringent privacy policies. The new App Tracking Transparency feature recently introduced on iOS is also present in tvOS. And let me tell you, the number of apps that ask for tracking privileges is quite eye-opening. It feels like on this platform more than any other, I’ve been bombarded with the pop-up asking me whether an app has permission to track me across other apps and websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYDJbs"&gt;Here’s just a sampling of streaming apps that have shown it so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nOHf4q"&gt;ABC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nxWrFa"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WnaYq3"&gt;CNN Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LD0XAT"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6KPeaw"&gt;Discovery Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rt9lzV"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DINq8N"&gt;Fox Now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nZD87l"&gt;FX Now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XWaKfB"&gt;Hulu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IAH4mx"&gt;Nat Geo TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6uFgBN"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z0Nidx"&gt;Sling TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3zLxsT"&gt;TBS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U5ksAd"&gt;TNT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Qw2xyJ"&gt;In my experience, Apple doesn’t sync up your chosen preference between iOS and tvOS when it comes to ATT. I’m getting the prompts &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; for all these streaming apps after already having seen them on my iPhone. It’s almost like Apple wants to emphasize how common tracking and data sharing has become among popular streaming services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1wwNB"&gt;The new Apple TV 4K has been outfitted with an HDMI 2.1 port, but it’s fair to say that Apple isn’t leveraging the full potential of that upgrade. If you’ve been following the next-gen console hype over the last year, you know that the latest Xbox consoles and PlayStation 5 are capable of high frame rates up to 120fps. The Apple TV 4K, meanwhile, tops out at 60fps HDR. Apple still considers this “high frame rate,” and it does lend a noticeable fluidity to sports, nature documentaries, and other videos that were originally shot at higher frame rates. (YouTube now supports 60fps on Apple TV 4K as well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CGyVX"&gt;However, that 60fps ceiling is a bummer for games on the platform. No one’s realistically expecting the Apple TV 4K to square off against the latest home consoles or come anywhere close, but 120Hz can still make a difference in responsiveness for titles with simpler graphics. On the subject of games, it’s worth noting that the new Siri Remote can’t be used as a controller like the previous one could; you’ve got to use a third-party gamepad now. The latest Xbox and PlayStation controllers are supported (with haptics included), and tvOS also works with a wide mix of others. It’s overall an improvement if you really want to play games on an Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGfqfNUpkQIqqzKnv6M2f13zTSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529636/DSCF3948_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has redesigned the Siri Remote, which is now larger and much easier to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz3gER"&gt;I covered the new Siri Remote in its own review, but since it comes bundled with the Apple TV 4K, here’s a summary: it’s very, very good. The larger, thicker design is easier to handle (and more difficult to lose), and the circular D-pad will prove more intuitive for a lot of the people who were perplexed by the trackpad on the old remote. The center button still lets you navigate in the same way by nudging your thumb around, but if you liked the large gesture area on the original Siri Remote, this one might feel more limiting. On the whole, I think Apple absolutely made the right move in changing up the design. It’s dramatically simpler to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmz4ZF"&gt;One feature I continue to wish the Apple TV 4K offered is spatial audio for AirPods owners. Being able to have a private bubble of surround sound when watching the biggest screen in your home seems like it could be a visceral experience. I know there are technical challenges and the Apple TV doesn’t have the same sensors as an iPhone or iPad, but I’m hopeful Apple will bring spatial audio to the platform at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4r7YfRKNF6gfIOg1Om2Om31FAds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541102/DSCF3896.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV 4K is expensive, but it delivers a top-notch streaming experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w9u8HW"&gt;If you have the original Apple TV 4K, there’s really no sensible reason to upgrade to the new one. Wi-Fi 6 is nice to have, and Thread might prove important to the smart home someday, but that time isn’t now. Otherwise, you’re getting a slightly faster experience than what the old box is capable of. Just buy the Siri Remote, and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z1xYTu"&gt;But if you’re coming from something older or the wildly overpriced Apple TV HD, the proposition is the same as always: you can get a very good 4K streaming gadget for a fraction of the Apple TV 4K’s price. But it’s unlikely to offer the same user experience or reliable performance. Or maybe some apps won’t support Dolby Vision or Atmos to the same degree they do on Apple TV. The Apple TV 4K is still overpriced, but it’s also still arguably the best streaming experience you’ll find in a single box — especially if you’re entrenched in Apple’s ecosystem. Does this new hardware feel like a true upgrade or big leap from the 2017 Apple TV 4K? No, not really. But at least they got the remote right. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scammy iOS app discovered that refuses to open unless you give it a good review</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mJwUQO2mVOG0Bwa8r_RmzeFyMbA=/0x1:1898x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344133/E2QqsPEVUAA8_Rg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of app reviews detailing the scammy behavior.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288727349657604" target="_blank"&gt;Kosta Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; / App Store&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kxk3Bk"&gt;App developer and scam app hunter Kosta Eleftheriou’s latest discovery is a real doozy, an iOS app that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288720357679104?s=21"&gt;refuses to function&lt;/a&gt; before you give it at least a 3-star review in the App Store. Although the UPNP Xtreme app — which claimed to let users stream video to their TVs — now appears to have &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1223416942"&gt;been pulled&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to verify that it generates the App Store rating box the second it opens. You can’t dismiss the ratings box, nor can you tap the 1 or 2-star ratings, Eleftheriou said. We verified this behavior, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/prvrtl/status/1397301269279223809"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; other &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HenrickTheBull/status/1397346867965571073"&gt;users &lt;/a&gt;report they were able to dismiss the dialog box or leave a lower rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrXoCo"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars"&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; scammy app to have been unearthed by Elefheriou, who’s been waging a war against them after his own Apple Watch keyboard app, FlickType, was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011082075148291"&gt;overtaken by expensive apps&lt;/a&gt; with fake reviews. Eleftheriou says Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou#:~:text=eleftheriou%20tells%20me%20that%20apple%20has%20removed%20over%20100%20apps%20due%20to%20his%20reports%20%E2%80%94%20and%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20wondering%20whether%20his%20online%20crusade%20is%20personal%2C%20the%20answer%20is%20most%20definitely%20yes"&gt;removed over 100 apps&lt;/a&gt; as a result of his reports, but it’s concerning that the multi-billion dollar company isn’t catching these scams during its App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b9o50E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you think you can trust App Store ratings, you haven’t been paying enough attention. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the iOS *system* rating prompt, not a custom look-alike one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst part? This trick is EXTREMELY easy for any developer to do, and not limited to this app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288722706489353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QKwGD7"&gt;The UPNP Xtreme app’s behavior directly contradicts one of the best practices Apple lists on its developer site, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/requesting_app_store_reviews"&gt;which states&lt;/a&gt; that developers should “avoid showing a request for a review immediately when a user launches your app.” Generally, developers are allowed to prompt for a rating up to there times in a 365-day period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTXPiB"&gt;Apple’s review process has been under particularly intense scrutiny recently because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic Games’ lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt;. Central to the dispute is the 30 percent commission Apple takes on many App Store payments and in-app purchases. Apple argues it needs the commission to run the App Store and create a safe environment for users. But that argument gets undermined pretty quickly if obvious scammy apps are able to slip through Apple’s review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoIyyV"&gt;Apps like the ones discovered by Eleftheriou not only harm customers who end up downloading scammy software and can get tricked into paying for difficult-to-cancel recurring subscriptions. It also harms legitimate developers who have to contend with apps that are willing to play dirty to get the good reviews needed to rise up the App Store’s rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEMtkm"&gt;Eleftheriou filed a lawsuit against Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it exploits its monopoly power over iOS app to make money at the expense of app developers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero 6 and Pro 6 owners are now getting Apple’s HomeKit security features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Eero 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZRxpe6AmJTfRembxdj0gg1Nl6ZE=/0x0:1162x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342649/eero6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Eero&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaRHCK"&gt;Owners of Amazon’s Eero 6 and Pro 6 routers will now be able to isolate their HomeKit IoT devices from the rest of their home network and the wider internet, thanks to a new integration with Apple’s HomeKit that’s now rolling out (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/eero-6-routers-homekit-support/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new feature is coming as part of a firmware update, and makes the routers some of the first Wi-Fi 6 systems that support Apple’s integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGdrph"&gt;The added feature may be welcome, but it’s probably not a surprise for those who have been paying attention: Eero’s other, cheaper routers were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/2/26/21154531/amazon-eero-routers-apple-homekit-support-internet-connection-security"&gt;updated to support it in February, 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and an Eero Support account &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/jnyua3/got_new_eero_6_pro_no_homekit_support/"&gt;mentioned in November&lt;/a&gt; that the router was going through Apple’s certification process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdjsQQ"&gt;Setting up your Eero (or any other supported routers) with HomeKit lets you manage how much data your other HomeKit devices are allowed to share over the network. If, for example, you had some smart window blinds that were a bit shady, you could use HomeKit to only allow them to talk to your local HomeKit Hub, and not connect to the internet (or other apps). It’s a niche benefit, to be sure, but if you were holding off on an Eero 6 purchase until it was available, it looks like the time has finally come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbIgjS"&gt;It’s worth noting that, to use the feature, a separate HomeKit Hub is required: this can be either an Apple TV, HomePod (regular or Mini), or iPad that stays in the house. If you want to activate HomeKit on your Eero router, the company &lt;a href="https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036319531-How-to-use-HomeKit-with-your-eero-Network"&gt;has a support page&lt;/a&gt; laying out all the details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See inside Apple’s colorful new M1 iMac, thanks to iFixit’s latest teardown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1Fc9oVwTXiY7oUWw3ybKwopoK0=/0x272:6552x4640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341558/lqgEBjUUFgYXyDRU.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGTmOM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BM1%2B24-Inch%2BTeardown%2F142850%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has published a detailed teardown&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s newly redesigned M1 processor-equipped iMac, and it contains bad news about how easy the new all-in-one is to repair. Whether it’s the fans, USB ports, headphone jack, power button, or speakers, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; says virtually any repairs to the new desktop require battling through Apple’s adhesives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jf3GVX"&gt;Like the other M1 Macs, everything is soldered together now — so there’s no upgrading RAM or internal storage even if you do crack it open. The good news is if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; go through the effort of cracking it open, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; says most of the other internal parts (including the ports, webcam, and speakers) are relatively easy to swap out with replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fNY1Rz"&gt;These problems might not matter right now while the iMacs are shiny, new, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;generally excellent&lt;/a&gt;, but they could make a world of difference in a few years when their components start to wear out and fail. &lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has long been critical of the repairability of Apple’s devices, but it’s arguably much more important for a device like the iMac, which tends to get replaced less often than a phone or tablet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called it “the computer to get if you just want to buy it and not think about it for the next five to ten years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Z1vBML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iMac M1 review: the all-in-one for almost everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="yVFrQL"&gt;If you thought the new iMac looks a lot like a massive iPad on a stand, then you might not be surprised to hear that much of what makes the iPad difficult to repair has been inherited by the new iMac. &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; has awarded the machine a total score of 2/10 for repairability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2XaNh"&gt;Apple’s M1 processors haven’t even been around for a year yet, so we don’t yet know how they’re going to hold up over time. But if any issues do crop up, this design could make it harder and more expensive for users to fix the machines they’re powering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lydcJg"&gt;This is far from the first time that &lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has criticized the repairability of an iMac. In 2015, for example, it awarded &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BIntel%2B21.5-Inch%2BEMC%2B2889%2BTeardown%2F50961&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s 21.5-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt; a low score of 1/10 for its repairability for design elements like having its RAM and CPU soldered onto the motherboard, preventing easy replacements or upgrades. Other iMacs like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BIntel%2B27-Inch%2BRetina%2B5K%2BDisplay%2BTeardown%2F30260&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;27-inch 5K iMac from 2014&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BPro%2BTeardown%2F101807&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2018 iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; fared better, thanks to their replaceable CPUs and RAM, but these are absent from the new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHVaCs"&gt;“Apple’s newest iMac follows the other M1 machines down an interesting, but even-less-repairable path,” the teardown concludes — an expected, albeit slightly disappointing direction that Apple’s ever-thinner hardware has been trending in for years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A courtroom artist’s view of the Epic v. Apple trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook gestures evocatively towards Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lE7uk8cn9Jacg8XaD-oZq211HyA=/0x220:3557x2591/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340850/IMG_2803.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Eight of the artist’s favorite sketches from the three-week court proceeding&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nMUQgm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Monday, lawyers &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gave final statements in the &lt;/em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;em&gt; case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, finishing up just over three weeks of in-court proceedings that gave an unprecedented look at how Apple manages the iOS App Store. Both images and audio from the proceedings were tightly controlled (as is often the case in federal courtrooms), so the only images came from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://courtroomartist.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;courtroom artist Vicki Behringer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, who saw much of the trial from an assigned seat to the right of the jury box. We invited Behringer to share eight of her favorite sketches from the trial, showing off both her skill as an artist and her unique perspective on the case. -Russell Brandom, policy editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Katherine Forrest gives opening remarks at the Epic v. Apple trial" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZ6LAdpYyhSupMzmAg25GAvxIrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539000/image0.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJW8Rx"&gt;This shows opening statements by Epic Games attorney Katherine Forrest. It was my first day at the trial and my first sketch. There were plexiglass barriers all around the courtroom as a COVID precaution, and the attorneys wore plastic shields covering their faces. When I saw this graphic, showing a wall being built around the iPhone, I started to understand what was at stake in this trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Epic CEO Tim Sweeney on the stand, protected by a plexiglass shield." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_abZ_CrHLf6xCQdDHVwojlzuvoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539007/IMG_2808.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L0NiV3"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is the one that started this whole case, so I knew his testimony was going to be interesting. I just loved listening to how he started the company and what the game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is all about. I had no idea. Once again, I realize there is another entire world that I know nothing about. The programming, creativity, and talent it takes to create these games absolutely amazes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5YOvO"&gt;I try to finish all my sketches within one to one and a half hours. Some take longer. I have to budget my time while I am sketching in the courtroom. I have very strict deadlines and since the news is now a 24-hour cycle with the internet, my media clients need their sketches as soon as possible to go with their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PuXpZsG6K41WmVeMzP_ZwhV2Bi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539001/IMG_2802.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKUMEo"&gt;I’ve sketched Phil Schiller two or three times now in the &lt;em&gt;Apple v. Samsung&lt;/em&gt; trials, so his face feels like an old friend. I always love hearing him talk about the history of Apple. I took my time here and decided to sketch the entire courtroom. Obviously it is not to scale. The number of people allowed in the courtroom was severely reduced, but there were still many, many attorneys to sketch, and every time a witness changed, they would play musical chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple executive Mike Schmid appears before the court." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M03qMJ_AbAmmpOuWKIxL7TnCqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539005/IMG_2797.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UE5PQ5"&gt;This is Mike Schmid, the head of Apple’s gaming department, questioned by Apple attorney Jay Srinivasan. Seeing as I am not a gamer, all of the wonderful artwork that goes into the games is quite delightful for me, but I had to move so fast that there wasn’t time to sketch it. Schmid was grilled pretty hard on the cross-examination by Epic’s attorney, but at the break they both relaxed and seemed to be happy to see each other. Maybe they were just happy to have gotten through it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rylrYo"&gt;Craig Federighi was a wonderful subject with his perfect white hair and dark eyebrows. People with subtle features are far more difficult, but Craig was a joy. He discussed the precautions that Apple takes to prevent its users from malware, viruses, and the like. I make a mental note to always update my software!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tim Cook gestures evocatively towards Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHtS8KG32XOlDZ9ntO10mjf0C2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539009/IMG_2803.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bgvbQi"&gt;I like this sketch because not only did I get a different angle on Tim Cook’s face (which is fantastic), but it was an important moment in his testimony. Judge Gonzalez Rogers was asking some really interesting questions of him which didn’t sound very favorable toward Apple. His confidence seemed to waver just a bit, but he answered the questions clearly and did his best to justify Apple‘s position. It felt like a pivotal point in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erO46K"&gt;I wanted to put in a gesture with the judge’s hand, but didn’t feel I had enough time. Sometimes hands can take as long as drawing the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cjjq7R"&gt;The second week was mostly expert witnesses. I like the sketch because this professor had some interesting things to say about how safe Apple devices were. I know he is an Apple witness, but if his statistics are correct, it’s quite amazing! In the sketch, I added a couple of other people in the courtroom that I usually don’t have time to include. The court reporter and the judge’s deputy. When I am doing an actual trial, I try to make sure I get a sketch of everyone in the courtroom at some point. Everyone is important, even if they are not one of the main attorneys or witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A wider view of Tim Cook’s testimony, including legal representatives from both sides at the edges of the frame." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b15aw8YQ5jmXx36yPYq8PjQ6PZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539012/IMG_2805.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PxUJ9p"&gt;This is when Tim Cook first took the stand, being questioned on direct by Apple attorney Veronica Moyé. I was so nervous while sketching him because I knew it had to look exactly like him; everyone knows what Tim Cook looks like. I had studied some photographs of him and thought I was ready. Unfortunately, when he took the stand there was a huge reflection on his face shield. I could not see some of the important details. I kept peering through my binoculars waiting for him to turn his head. Finally he did and I was able to get a good view of his face. That was such a relief!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ytbVfv"&gt;I had heard this was his first time taking the stand, but I would never know it. He was quite calm, confident, and charismatic. He said so many positive things about Apple it was easy to like him. Later, I had the opportunity while finishing a sketch of him in the hallway to meet him. He seems to be a very nice man. I was shocked to see he has beautiful blue eyes. I did not realize that while sketching him — between the shadow from the light above, the reflection of his visor, and his glasses, his eyes were obscured. Something tells me I will be sketching him again since there could be more Apple trials in my future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees are going public about workplace issues — and there’s no going back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of the Apple logo in the middle of being unpeeled over a teal background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL9J39LHuK-1iR3yAFIs9RCSW1E=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340817/4599_Apple_Leaks_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Employees say the recent leaks might have changed the tech giant forever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hdqgIN"&gt;Even to the workers who wrote the letter, the leaks came as a shock. Apple employees rarely speak to the media, particularly about the company culture. In Silicon Valley, Apple operates with an unprecedented level of secrecy, managing personnel issues and product launches with complete authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWSzRq"&gt;The culture has benefits for employees. People work at Apple because they are design fanatics. The elegant hardware products are seen by many as unmatched in the tech industry. Fewer leaks mean fewer distractions and more time to focus on the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpoIWU"&gt;The company also has an aura of prestige. Working at Apple is widely seen as the pinnacle of success in the tech industry, even more than the company’s biggest rivals. If Google is a sprawl of creativity and ideas, Apple represents a workplace of organization and vision. People don’t go there for a few months or a year; they stay for decades. The tenure makes employees loyal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcSQsd"&gt;So it was surprising, to some, when the company hired Antonio García Martínez, a former product manager at Facebook who’d written a tell-all book about Silicon Valley. García Martínez’s tone in the book was brash and misogynistic — it didn’t match with Apple’s carefully managed public image and commitment to diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXCzDg"&gt;After he arrived, multiple female Apple employees went public about their concerns on Twitter — a rarity at a company where employees are discouraged from sharing their opinions about work. “I have been gutted, as many other folks at Apple were, with the hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1392618677644767238"&gt;wrote Apple engineer Cher Scarlett&lt;/a&gt;. “I believe in the strength of community we have at Apple, &amp;amp; that the culture we’ve built can weather this. I also believe in leadership to do the right thing, whatever that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wSWOAJ"&gt;Then, a group of workers wrote a letter calling for an investigation. “Given Mr. García Martínez’s history of publishing overtly racist and sexist remarks about his former colleagues, we are concerned that his presence at Apple will contribute to an unsafe working environment for our colleagues who are at risk of public harassment and private bullying,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAfjZf"&gt;Within hours, the letter had well over 1,000 signatures. It was leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That evening, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;García Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="23NoeK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Either somebody is a very good actor or there’s someone else who felt like the letter was going to disappear unless it became public.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qAV2X6"&gt;The events stunned even the letter writers. They’d expected the note to cause a stir inside Apple, but they hadn’t intended for it to become public. “The leak was very shocking to everybody who was vocal and involved in writing the letter,” says one worker who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional retaliation. “Either somebody is a very good actor or there’s someone else who felt like the letter was going to disappear unless it became public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWpPLf"&gt;A week after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published the García Martínez letter, a group of Muslim employees at Apple penned a note calling for the company to release a statement in support of Palestine. When Tim Cook didn’t respond, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;the letter was leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btgiYM"&gt;The two letters, and their leaks, are signs of a slow cultural shift at Apple. Employees, once tight-lipped about internal problems, are now joining a wave of public dissent that’s roiling Silicon Valley. Employees say this is partly because Apple’s typical avenues for reporting don’t work for big cultural issues. They also note the company rolled out Slack in 2019, allowing workers to find and organize with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDwuVf"&gt;Now, some are beginning to feel that the company culture has harmed diversity and inclusion efforts. “Apple’s secrecy works great for protecting our customers and our products, but it hinders inclusion and diversity,” says an anonymous employee. “There’s a lack of education around what is confidential versus what is your protected speech and you should speak up about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7BYeP"&gt;Public organizing, particularly on social media, has been enormously successful in Silicon Valley, allowing workers to wrestle power away from management. At Google, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/google-forced-arbitration.html"&gt;it’s led the company to end forced arbitration for all full-time employees&lt;/a&gt;. At Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;it’s spawned massive unionizing campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it seems to be Apple’s turn. “Suddenly at Apple, as everywhere else, managers can only stand back and watch as workers reshape the bounds of what will be permitted at work,” &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-hire-that-roiled-apple?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzY0NzEsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM2MzgyMjIwLCJfIjoieUhrVDgiLCJpYXQiOjE2MjE4Nzk1NTcsImV4cCI6MTYyMTg4MzE1NywiaXNzIjoicHViLTc5NzYiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.OrzoB0_ydpKdfXH27yXSKixg4BC4YNvkEg0aRslStko"&gt;wrote Casey Newton, founder and editor of &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dkfvxs"&gt;There’s no sign the leaks will extend to Apple’s product launches. This is the part of the business that Apple cares about most — and it has gone to great lengths to dissuade employees from leaking. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;sent out a note threatening to fire and even sue workers who shared product information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAbGT3"&gt;The company also has a structure in place to prevent employees from sharing — or even finding out about — product information before it’s public. Employees sign project-specific NDAs and are dissuaded from telling their spouses about their work. Their badges only open certain doors at the company’s Cupertino, California headquarters. Prior to the pandemic, most engineers were barred from taking products in development home from the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwufxD"&gt;The culture of secrecy has bled over into many aspects of Apple’s culture. But employees say it is enforced more through norms than through rules. “The habit of secrecy is self-enforcing once established,” an anonymous employee says. Most of the time, problems are escalated internally and quietly resolved without the public ever finding out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CdElUJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How do you report someone who has done something, but hasn’t done something to you specifically?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JERiFA"&gt;That didn’t happen when García Martínez was hired at Apple. Female employees weren’t sure who would care about their concerns. “For women, it was especially sensitive because the things that were being highlighted [from &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys] &lt;/em&gt;were all very misogynistic, so it felt very personal, but at the same time, who do you report it to?” asked an anonymous worker. “How do you report someone who has done something, but hasn’t done something to you specifically?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjuKx4"&gt;Apple employees are quick to point out that they’ve been organizing internally for years. In 2020, they pushed the company to move away from using the terms “master” and “slave” in engineering contexts where one process controlled another, part of an &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-confronts-use-labels-master-slave/"&gt;industry-wide shift away from the labels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8h1YG"&gt;They also called for Election Day and Juneteenth to become paid company holidays in a letter last year. “Apple is one of the most influential companies in the world,” they wrote. “While there is undeniable momentum behind the Black Lives Matter civil rights movement, we can and should be setting a better standard for other companies to follow. We believe we have an opportunity with Election Days to be a leader that forges ahead of the rest.” The push was largely successful. On July 24th, 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-24/apple-to-give-employees-paid-time-off-to-vote-in-u-s-election?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the company was giving workers four hours off to vote on Election Day. Employees in the United States get Juneteenth off this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NVAHl"&gt;Apple management might not love what is happening — it’s not very Apple-y, after all — but if employees maintain their secrecy surrounding its products, the firm might not care enough to crack down. Workers can tweet about Apple, just not Apple products. And they likely will: as one anonymous employee told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in the wake of the García Martínez letter, “I think this has forever changed the culture of Apple.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1U7ks"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tidal now also offers offline listening on the Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzihcGwATCdsY0OUrDD7qarx8kQ=/255x0:2145x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339545/TIDAL_on_Apple_Watch_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tidal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o5Ek5G"&gt;Music streaming service Tidal is now available &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2FAppleWatch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453031%2Ftidal-apple-watch-offline-listening-spotify-deezer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, allowing subscribers to stream music directly to Apple’s wearable or download it for offline listening. Instructions on how to get set up can be found on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2FAppleWatch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453031%2Ftidal-apple-watch-offline-listening-spotify-deezer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tidal’s site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443522/deezer-apple-watch-offline-listening"&gt;Deezer&lt;/a&gt; both announced similar offline listening features for the Apple Watch last week. Subscription prices for Tidal start at $9.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpKOR7"&gt;Tidal has historically sold itself on the quality of its audio streaming, offering features like lossless playback and even hi-res streaming before many of its bigger rivals. But this year, some of its biggest competitors are starting to catch up. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify’s lossless HiFi tier&lt;/a&gt; is set to launch later this year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;Apple Music will introduce support&lt;/a&gt; for lossless and hi-res streaming next month. Tidal’s high audio quality won’t translate to its Apple Watch app however. The music service has confirmed audio will be limited to 96Kbps on the wearable, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;like Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f8uVMB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tidal is facing renewed competition from Spotify and Apple Music&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4wHzl"&gt;The service’s other major selling point is the amount it pays artists in royalties to stream their music. Analysis &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/12/25/streaming-music-services-pay-2019/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Digital Music News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; puts Tidal’s rates ahead of Spotify, Apple, and Deezer, and it looks like this artist-supporting trend is set to continue after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;Jack Dorsey’s financial services company Square recently acquired a majority stake&lt;/a&gt; in the streaming service for $297 million. Dorsey specifically cited wanting to find “new ways for artists to support their work” as the reason for the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YV11Ry"&gt;“Square created ecosystems of tools for sellers &amp;amp; individuals and we’ll do the same for artists,” the CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460914149003271"&gt;tweeted at the time&lt;/a&gt;, “We’ll work on entirely new listening experiences to bring fans closer together, simple integrations for merch sales, modern collaboration tools, and new complementary revenue streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ewwp6Q"&gt;Tidal’s Apple Watch support requires a Series 3 model or later running watchOS 7.1. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flexibits’ contact app Cardhop gets fresh revamp, added to Fantastical subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_KBwBLItdssAbe70WYumqc-wRgE=/332x0:2495x1442/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338916/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.22.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntEZaa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://flexibits.com/cardhop"&gt;Flexibits&lt;/a&gt; — best known for its popular calendar application, Fantastical — has a new, overhauled version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16488490/cardhop-contacts-app-announced-fantastical-flexibits"&gt;contact management application Cardhop&lt;/a&gt; out today, which updates the app with new features and a fresh coat of paint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okjI9n"&gt;But most importantly, like Fantastical before it, Cardhop is also switching to a subscription model. The contact app is being added for free to the existing Fantastical Premium subscription that Flexibits introduced last year. And to mark that expanded scope, Fantastical Premium is also getting a new name: Flexibits Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rAnGkz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS and Mac calendar app Fantastical is moving to a subscription model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21109700/fantastical-flexibits-subscription-service-premium-price-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DCOHPu"&gt;The original Mac and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18280578/cardhop-app-contact-management-ios"&gt;iOS versions&lt;/a&gt; of Cardhop previously cost $19.99 and $4.99, respectively. However, similar to Fantastical, Flexibits will now be offering a more limited, free version of both of those applications to anyone, with more advanced functionality (including many of the new features being introduced with the new version of the app) locked to subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfNZuv_zi4IjQXJbNHchfh2ibdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536968/cardhop.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RE0l8s"&gt;Flexibits, crucially, isn’t changing the price of its subscription program to go with the newly added app. Flexibits Premium will still cost $4.99 a month or $39.99 a year for an individual user, or $7.99 per month or $64.99 per year for up to five family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8Z4FH"&gt;Existing Cardhop owners will still be able to access any features that were already present in their existing apps from before the switch to the subscription model without having to pay (also similar to the Fantastical switch). They just won’t get any major &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; features going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNwhgPAJDRHlzRw1gHLZ9GMK9Ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536973/Relationships_Family_Tree.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mqKU3I"&gt;Cardhop 2.0 does add a variety of new features, though. There’s a new Relationships mode, which can generate family trees for contacts that you’ve set relationships between or — if you have Google or Office 365 accounts linked — org charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDkunN"&gt;The iOS version of Cardhop has a new business card scanning feature, which does exactly what it says on the can, and there are new widgets for both macOS and iOS that can be customized to add quick links to call, text, or interact with a contact using any of Cardhop’s actions. (Want a link to quickly FaceTime a friend? Now you can.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idww5freXqEprE-bD1SNNdphMoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536965/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.22.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SDYFJq"&gt;And given that Cardhop and Fantastical are now bundled together, there are also some deeper ties with the Flexibits calendar app. A new “Invite with Fantastical” action makes it easy to invite contacts (or whole groups of contacts) to events. Scanning a business card also gives an option to quickly follow up with an instant calendar meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrT2Ek"&gt;The new version of Cardhop is available to download now for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple stayed on message while Epic filled out the record</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1FSSBv"&gt;Sure, “hot-tubbing” &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; fun, but in a court context, it’s just a judge encouraging lawyers to argue — which is how &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ended today. Not with a bang but with a quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbuGmB"&gt;In honor of the trial’s final day, a raft of spare lawyers were in the gallery, representing Epic and Apple. But everyone who spoke to the judge — Epic’s Gary Bornstein and the three lawyers who handled the end of the case for Apple, Dan Swanson, Veronica Smith Moye, and Richard Doren — had their backs to the gallery the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OU1n2W"&gt;Throughout the trial, Epic’s general strategy appears to have been to stuff the record as full of evidence as possible — just in case it’s needed on the inevitable appeal. To do that, Epic sacrificed telling a coherent story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4vmxWH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple had a clear story and it spent the entire trial hammering it home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AxNHLE"&gt;Apple, on the other hand, was on brand. It had a clear story and it spent the entire trial hammering it home: Apple controls the App Store because the alternative would be a security and privacy nightmare. Whether it was Swanson, Moye, or Doren at the podium, this story didn’t waver, just as it mostly didn’t waver throughout the rest of the trial. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Tim Cook biffed this&lt;/a&gt; by citing a business model and not mentioning security.) Phil Schiller, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;Apple’s marketing guru&lt;/a&gt;, sat at the table with the lawyers throughout the trial; from time to time, I found myself wondering how involved he was in crafting the lawyers’ messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDbVsS"&gt;Both parties agreed that the top two issues of the day were market definition and remedies. Who you will agree with in the end is going to depend on how the market is defined, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bt1hH4"&gt;For Epic, we’re talking mobile app stores, and the question of the operating system on the phone is key. After all, even though Samsung and LG and whoever else make phones, from a developer’s point of view that doesn’t matter. You’re making games for Android or iOS. This seems fairly sensible, particularly after Schiller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;cited extremely minor competition&lt;/a&gt; in his testimony: Amazon’s Fire tablets and Microsoft’s failed Windows phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X57l1x"&gt;It is less clear to me why game consoles should be excluded as competition. Apple, obviously, wants to say there’s a &lt;em&gt;great deal&lt;/em&gt; of competition — but to tell the truth, my initial reaction to this antitrust trial was, “But can’t you just play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on a console?” Epic’s Bornstein mentioned that most consoles aren’t mobile; as the owner of a handheld Nintendo Switch, I strongly disagree! Bornstein had, of course, thought of this — the Switch doesn’t connect to wireless networks, he said, and thus is not truly “mobile.” By this standard, anyone who owns an iPhone that has the functionality for data over the cellular network switched off — perhaps because they are a child and a parent handled this setting, or perhaps because they are just cheap — also doesn’t truly own a mobile phone. That seems incorrect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6o8Lwo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“But can’t you just play ‘Fortnite’ on a console?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0myP52"&gt;Hilariously, Apple’s Swanson pointed out that it is not the ‘90s. What he meant was that we don’t just have one device — multiple devices are much more the norm than they used to be. If all these devices are substitutes for each other, then what does it matter to users if they have to use a PC or a console to get to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;? Some testimony we heard from Apple’s experts earlier in the trial suggested that 80 percent of iOS players were making their in-app purchases elsewhere, Swanson reminded us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARkpvM"&gt;The reason the market definition matters so much is clear: if I agree with Apple’s view that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a game, and the competitive market is basically anywhere I can buy a game, Epic has no case. But if I agree with Epic’s view that the relevant market is mobile app distribution, then Apple’s refusal to allow any apps that aren’t in the app store on the iPhone is pretty unquestionably monopolistic. This is where Epic’s failure to tell a clear, simple, and coherent story sets its case back. Even if I agree that Apple has at times deliberately hamstrung its competition — and I do agree with this, otherwise there would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;no green bubbles on iMessage&lt;/a&gt; — I still can’t say in simple language why consoles aren’t an acceptable substitute for gaming on mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipjXDh"&gt;But leave that aside. I’m not the judge, after all! And Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers pointed out that it was possible Epic’s proposed remedy — allowing other app stores onto the iPhone and allowing side-loading of apps — &lt;em&gt;destroyed&lt;/em&gt; consumer choice. After all, she suggested, people are generally aware of Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem and are choosing it on purpose. Besides, she noted, the cost of apps in Google’s store was roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF8g7z"&gt;Well, Epic’s Bornstein said, that’s because it’s a duopoly. There is only one place in the record where Apple concerns itself with pricing pressure: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418828/apple-app-store-commission-30-percent-phil-schiller-2011-epic-lawsuit"&gt;a 2011 email from Schiller&lt;/a&gt;, asking if at some point Apple may have to lower their commission. Apparently, pricing competition still hasn’t caused Apple to lower its commission, unless a lawsuit counts as “competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zYgfwN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This line of questioning suggested that Gonzales Rogers agreed there isn’t competitive pressure on Apple’s pricing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="batGhH"&gt;See, Apple’s small developer program, which dropped the commission for certain studios, seemed to be the result of &lt;em&gt;this lawsuit&lt;/em&gt; more than anything else. (“The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Gonzales Rogers said last week&lt;/a&gt;.) This skeptical line of questioning suggested, at least to me, that Gonzales Rogers agreed there isn’t competitive pressure on Apple’s pricing. That’s probably welcome news for Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nsP7c"&gt;The day’s other hot topic was remedies — if Apple does indeed have a monopoly and is acting anti-competitively with it, what should be the outcome? Epic wanted to prohibit the restrictions that make the App Store the sole option for downloading apps on iOS — which would mean allowing both side-loading and other game stores on the iPhone. Epic also wanted to get rid of the requirement that in-app transactions for digital goods must use Apple’s in-app purchase processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBo2lk"&gt;To Apple, this just meant that Epic wants to use Apple’s IP — like developer tools — without paying for it. After all, Apple’s Doren pointed out, the company could have only allowed its own apps on the iPhone, as it did with the very first one (which was promptly jailbroken so other apps could be loaded, but never mind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gq9539"&gt;Gonzalez Rogers seemed skeptical about the remedies. Besides the IP question, which there was a healthy back-and-forth about, she asked Epic’s Bornstein to cite some cases where courts required businesses to totally change their business model. Well, there’s Microsoft, Bornstein said. Yes, but that case had been brought by the government, and Epic is not the government. In fact, Gonzalez Rogers said, Epic hadn’t shown her a single comparable antitrust case where the kind of ruling Epic was requesting had been granted by a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gtNJV"&gt;Setting aside the fact that I am not a mind reader nor a judge, what I heard in court today didn’t sound like a win for Epic. Yes, the record is stuffed full of times Apple behaved badly. But the question isn’t whether Apple has always behaved well. I walked out of court feeling Apple had the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYxTTz"&gt;Of course, all the evidence Epic crammed on the record may serve them beyond an appeal. After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;Amy Klobuchar has said she’s watching this trial closely&lt;/a&gt;. So even if Epic loses this battle, its strategy may win the war — by creating new antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;
