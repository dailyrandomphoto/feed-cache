    <title>WWDC 2021: the latest news from Apple’s annual developer conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CpiqaJWWcv1rMhdZW6jMew37egc=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417646/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What’s new in the Apple ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="K28Qfi"&gt;Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC, will run from June 7th through the 11th this year, with the main keynote set for June 7th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. Like last year, &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22085002"&gt;the event will be virtual&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s probably safe to expect another immaculately produced keynote video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFthrB"&gt;Apple is likely to announce updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It’ll be interesting to see what Apple does with the iPad and Mac especially; the iPad Pro is now powered by the same M1 chips as Apple’s best laptops, but its OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"&gt;arguably holds it back&lt;/a&gt;.  We’re also still waiting on the pro-focused MacBooks and iMacs. While the current versions are fast, they lack the ports and RAM capacity that professionals are looking for, so we’ll be on the lookout for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;rumored MacBook Pro refresh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO3Ahi"&gt;We’ll be covering everything that happens on the day, and any news that comes out after, which you can catch up on here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Live blog: Apple’s 2021 WWDC keynote with iOS 15, iPadOS, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWYEH5TwoQiPm42dgvTDMjBrg9Q=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417624/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How many operating systems can Apple update at once?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uhj88V"&gt;Apple’s 2021 Worldwide Developers Conference is upon us again, and we will be tracking all of the new software announcements from the keynote. Apple has a lot of operating system plates spinning and has done a decent job keeping a lot of things under wraps. But there are some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397236/ios-ipados-15-features-rumors-notifications-privacy-home-screen-report"&gt;obvious questions that &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x9yCSd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple heads into developer conference under more scrutiny than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"},{"title":"Apple isn’t just a walled garden, it’s a carrier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"},{"title":"iOS 15 will reportedly include notifications revamp, new iPad home screen, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397236/ios-ipados-15-features-rumors-notifications-privacy-home-screen-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NtGyaH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397236/ios-ipados-15-features-rumors-notifications-privacy-home-screen-report"&gt;could be answered&lt;/a&gt; in the online-only event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIWEJL"&gt;Apple’s Arm-based M1 Macs have exceeded most people’s expectations for performance and battery life — but the future of macOS still seems fuzzy with so many different kinds of supported apps. All of that could be forgiven if Apple makes one of its rare WWDC hardware announcements with new MacBook Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osY9BQ"&gt;iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS are all likely to get some attention — and we may even see tvOS get renamed to HomeOS in a nod to the HomePod and Apple’s smart home ambitions. The iPad is expected to get a revamped home screen and maybe another revision to its windowing system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zANOCk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jpt1c"&gt;All that, some surprises, and what’s sure to be a lot of swooping drone transitions about Apple Park are in store. But the biggest question of all is whether Apple will directly address the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"&gt;growing developer discontent&lt;/a&gt; around its App Store policies. It’s a long shot, but that’s why we live blog: tune in to watch along with us!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple paid millions after iPhone repair techs posted a customer’s nude photos to Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone games" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5e5X5UfufPK53rTPoY3FzzJDIM=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417568/iphone-games-001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gLtyDh"&gt;Apple paid an unknown multimillion-dollar sum to a woman after iPhone repair technicians uploaded nude photos from her phone to Facebook. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2021%2F06%2F06%2Fapple-pays-millions-woman-explicit-photos-posted-online%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22522560%2Fapple-repair-multimillion-iphone-nude-photos-privacy-settlement-pegatron" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; reported the 2016 payment&lt;/a&gt; based on court documents recently tied to Apple’s name, and Apple confirmed the incident in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBphzs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340837/gov.uscourts.cand.340837.141.2.pdf"&gt;The case involves&lt;/a&gt; an unnamed Oregon college student known as Jane Doe, who sent her iPhone to a major Apple repair contractor called Pegatron Technology Service. While the phone was being repaired at Pegatron’s California facility, two technicians uploaded sexually explicit photos and a video from her phone to her Facebook account. Court documents say the files were uploaded in a way that suggested Doe had posted them herself, and her attorney asked Apple for $5 million in compensation for the resulting emotional distress. &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; says the exact amount of a subsequent agreement wasn’t revealed, but it amounted to a “multimillion-dollar” deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtZxWS"&gt;Documents say Apple performed an “exhaustive investigation” of the facility, and the two employees responsible for the incident were fired. “We take the privacy and security of our customers’ data extremely seriously and have a number of protocols in place to ensure data is protected throughout the repair process,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “When we learned of this egregious violation of our policies at one of our vendors in 2016, we took immediate action and have since continued to strengthen our vendor protocols.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6ljOF"&gt;The incident became public because Pegatron reimbursed Apple for the settlement, then &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6817054/pegatron-technology-service-inc-v-zurich-american-ins-co/"&gt;sued its own insurance provider&lt;/a&gt; for refusing to cover the payment. Apple pushed successfully for its name to be removed from the filings, and it’s referred to only as a “customer” in the complaint. But its identity was revealed in a &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340837/gov.uscourts.cand.340837.141.0.pdf"&gt;newer, unrelated case&lt;/a&gt; involving Apple and Pegatron, where attorneys stated that the customer was “clearly Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="inOaBs"&gt;Other companies have faced lawsuits after repair technicians invaded customers’ privacy — in 2015, for instance, Best Buy &lt;a href="https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/DA/20150702/News/605153539/TL"&gt;settled a suit&lt;/a&gt; claiming Geek Squad members copied a woman’s nude photos from her computer and posted them online. But as &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; notes, Apple has made privacy and security a selling point for the iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Apple-iPhone-Right-to-Repair-program_id120557"&gt;arguing against&lt;/a&gt; consumer “right to repair” laws that it says would compromise the safety of its authorized repair program.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s WWDC 2021 keynote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TY3YFSwdDg8PRWKubp9wWyHzERY=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415491/Apple_WWDC21_details_announcement_052421_big.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x8dZAy"&gt;Apple’s hosting its second &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22320961/apple-wwdc-2021-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos"&gt;all-virtual Worldwide Developers Conference&lt;/a&gt; this year, and it seems like the company plans to squeeze in even more hardware announcements alongside its usual software updates. WWDC 2021 will run all week long, but things start off with the traditional Apple keynote on June 7th at 10AM PT / 1PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pWF5s"&gt;Apple is expected to try to win back professional users at WWDC by leaning in with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;a new more powerful M2 chip and a redesigned MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; that ditches maligned features like the Touch Bar and brings back the HDMI port and MagSafe. The new M2 is rumored to have double the processor and GPU cores, and it might not even be Apple’s top-of-the-line: the company is rumored to launch a more powerful iMac and Mac Pro sometime later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isgRfL"&gt;WWDC 2021 may bring some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397236/ios-ipados-15-features-rumors-notifications-privacy-home-screen-report"&gt;equally big changes to iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;. iPads might finally get an updated homescreen with fully customizable widgets, after years of mostly looking like a blown-up iPhone. Both operating systems are also rumored to get a new privacy menu for viewing the data apps use, notification settings that can be set around a user’s status (like if they’re driving or sleeping), and possibly a big update to iMessage and the Messages app that will make the service more of a social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bjn9le"&gt;That’s a whole lot to talk about, even ignoring minor changes to macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, but the company will be hosting developer sessions throughout the week to get into all of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lu9iPJ"&gt;WHEN DOES WWDC 2021 START?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GEHGpB"&gt;It starts at 1PM ET / 10AM PT / 6PM BST. Following the keynote, developer sessions will be available to watch online for free through June 11th via the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/"&gt;Apple Developer website&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958"&gt;Apple Developer app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aFoXcC"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH WWDC 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Apple isn’t just a walled garden, it’s a carrier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EOVAZBTSxaXtdfoSJRMar_ds3hM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415337/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The return of the Angry God of ARPU&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bil1UH"&gt;As we await the beginning of Apple’s latest WWDC keynote and all of the new software products it will unveil, let’s talk about metaphors. Specifically, the metaphors we use to talk about Apple’s ecosystem. The go-to for years has been that it’s a “walled garden” — here’s Joanna Stern at &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; making that case in a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-airpods-macbook-you-live-in-apples-world-heres-what-you-are-missing-11622817653?mod=followjoannastern"&gt;literal walled garden&lt;/a&gt; — but I’m not sure that’s the best one anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IS0KpJ"&gt;It’s worth kicking around some different ways of describing Apple’s ecosystem in this moment because of the nature of keynotes — even online-only keynotes. Apple is the master of crafting narratives around its products that become an organizing principle for understanding what those products are. Those narratives aren’t intellectual exercises, they’re stories told to change how you feel about Apple and its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2Se0M"&gt;There’s nothing inherently nefarious about Apple telling a story about itself and its products, but right now there are more counter-narratives than there ever have been. Apple is facing antitrust scrutiny from governments around the world, from its Epic lawsuit, and from the very developers it is addressing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxbHLE"&gt;Having some metaphors in your back pocket is a good starting point to craft your own narrative rather than accepting any of the above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAVVct"&gt;Metaphors work because they let you adopt the things you know and feel about one thing and apply them to another thing. They help organize your thoughts and can inspire you to look at a device in a different way. Steve Jobs was a master of this way of thinking. Is a computer a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c"&gt;bicycle for the mind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfJ3QxJYsw8"&gt;is it a truck&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;div id="w85Fbb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob_GX50Za6c?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Qjzsd6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfJ3QxJYsw8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utFTUU"&gt;The answer is, of course, it’s both and neither. Metaphors are never one to one — otherwise they’d be &lt;em&gt;definitions&lt;/em&gt;. (Sidenote: I invite you to consider whether “computer” is best thought of as a &lt;em&gt;metaphor&lt;/em&gt; instead of a &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; when you think about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;whether the iPad&lt;/a&gt; is a computer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FCAIz"&gt;So that “walled garden.” It is, first and foremost, a &lt;em&gt;garden&lt;/em&gt; — it is tended, beautiful, and calming. It’s very nice to be in Apple’s world. Most things work together in harmony, and it’s often hard to forget there’s a big, big world of apps and services outside those walls. You can very happily use an iPhone to do almost anything you’d want without ever downloading a third-party app. You’re protected in some ways by those walls and — especially on the iPhone — your privacy is in some ways ensured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAl8BK"&gt;It’s a good metaphor! But the destiny of all metaphors is to become cliché. Through use and familiarity, they lose their emotive and explanatory power. When I call Apple a walled garden, it’s likely you know exactly what I mean and have already had the rest of the discussion in your head. The metaphor has lost the ability to help us understand more than we think we know. So let’s  keep “walled garden” around, but think about the other metaphors we might use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9BNC4"&gt;One is the “Apple Tax,” the 30 percent (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150629/apple-small-business-program-app-store-reduced-commission-15-percent-developers"&gt;15 percent&lt;/a&gt; if you’re able to wrangle it) cut of every digital transaction Apple takes on the iPhone. It’s at the center of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit, another Supreme Court case facing Apple, Spotify’s complaint in the EU that has led to government action, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzKxdE"&gt;Lots of people hate taxes, but they are meant to pay for valuable shared infrastructure. But then again, maybe Apple already covered those costs by selling iPhones, so the Apple Tax is egregiously high — or, if you prefer a different metaphor with legal overtones, maybe it’s &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/"&gt;rent-seeking&lt;/a&gt;. Something about calling Apple’s cut a “tax” strikes me as a little over the top; the 2021 equivalent of spelling Microsoft with a $ in place of the s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0SkDl"&gt;During the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, a new metaphor popped into my head and I can’t shake it. As I was looking at the emails that Apple executives were sending each other and reading their testimony during the trial, I kept thinking I’d seen this kind of behavior and even some of the justifications before. And so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzuDZ9"&gt;Apple is a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EoeZAd"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CW38nS"&gt;I mean “carrier” as in cellular network carrier, as in Apple is Verizon or T-Mobile or (shudder) AT&amp;amp;T. Here’s how the metaphor works: The most important thing to any carrier is feeding the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11193086/verizon-att-carrier-crapware-revenue-trick-samsung-software"&gt;Angry God of ARPU&lt;/a&gt; (average revenue per user). That number must go up to please shareholders and pay executives, and the carriers have engaged in any number of shenanigans to make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9aEAl"&gt;Carriers have forced pre-installed crapware on phones since the beginning of apps on phones, well before the iPhone. Examples are too numerous to count, but I’m talking about more than just pre-installed &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;-style games. Users have always been encouraged by the design of the phone and the restrictions placed on the networks themselves to do things that make the carriers more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vyjve4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Carriers once dictated what smartphones were allowed to do. It’s happening again&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PGEbJI"&gt;Verizon made &lt;a href="https://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/verizon-how-much-do-you-charge-now/"&gt;data buttons designed to be clicked by accident so you’d be charged&lt;/a&gt;. Sprint &lt;a href="https://blog.chron.com/jkonthephone/2007/01/sprint-testing-daily-charge-for-phone-web-browsing/"&gt;charged a daily fee to users who had the gall to access the web directly instead of using its WAP data portal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/22/3260771/ATT-facetime-3g-charges"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T famously blocked FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; from working on its network unless users paid for more expensive data plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyOMyt"&gt;Every carrier has required wholly unnecessary navigation apps to be pinned to the launcher. Verizon used to go even further, &lt;a href="https://gigaom.com/2009/07/17/verizon-please-stop-disabling-gps-in-smartphones-on-your-network/"&gt;literally disabling GPS on smartphones on its network&lt;/a&gt;. That way it could force users to use (and pay for) its own navigation app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffdvlv"&gt;All of this is egregious behavior that goes far beyond the practices Apple engages in on the iPhone, but the exercise of control in order to make more money is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3s7ma"&gt;Apple uses its absolute control of app distribution on iOS to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;pressure developers into adding in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;, creating more opportunities for the company to take a cut. And Apple freely puts notifications and advertisements for its own services on the iPhone while limiting what other apps are allowed to do. A prompt to sign up for an Apple Card here. Apple Music offer there. Arcade, Fitness Plus, Apple News Plus, an offer to get a warranty in the main Settings app. It’s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="JepqbE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When you have to reset all your iPhone settings it becomes painfully clear that Apple apps have a different set of rules than everybody else when it comes to allowing notifications by default. &lt;a href="https://t.co/C75anymrJw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/C75anymrJw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1352795378119151621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="87hQST"&gt;I admit it’s not fair to say Apple is as bad today as the carriers were back in the day when it comes to squeezing dollars out of users or developers. Nor is it fair to argue that Apple’s forays into content with TV Plus are the equivalent of AT&amp;amp;T’s flailing efforts at merging a TV network with a cellular network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="humso2"&gt;It’s not fair, but the tune sounds familiar because the parallels strike a chord. And the bitter harmony that I hear is the stifling of innovation to maximize profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yB7tek"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What businesses and opportunities are foreclosed by App Store policies?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z9HBFI"&gt;Apple forces all apps selling digital goods of any kind to use its payment system and pay its cut. The arguments for why Apple thinks that is necessary are well-known. But the effects of that (and other) rules are that new and innovative business models simply aren’t possible. Instead of paid upgrades, developers must resort to subscriptions. The nascent market to pay creators directly on services like Twitter and Substack must account for Apple’s platform fees. Instead of game streaming apps, there is… well, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJlkGQ"&gt;Of all the rules of the Apple App Store, to me the most telling is the “anti-steering” rule that prevents app makers from even hinting that there might be alternate ways to pay for things without using Apple’s in-app purchase system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Spznf"&gt;Take Ring, the division of Amazon that sells smart home gadgets. Because of these anti-steering rules, it doesn’t allow you to sign up for a subscription in its iPhone app. Instead, you are directed to an &lt;a href="https://ring.com/mobile/free-trial-expired"&gt;informational webpage&lt;/a&gt;. But Apple’s rules extend even to that webpage, hosted on Ring’s own website. It contains no information about how much a subscription costs, no links to sign up, or any other actually useful information. To get around Apple’s rules, Ring instead has a video and a chat bot that will eventually tell you how to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wPY8TK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Similarly, the chat bot requires a few extra interactions before you get to a subscribe page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, the ways Ring tells you how to subscribe on iOS appear to be designed to get around automated review and maybe even light human review. Incredible!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5/ &lt;a href="https://t.co/67CDpl4nsB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/67CDpl4nsB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1401204093348052992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="424vBS"&gt;The most revealing moment of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial came perhaps at the end, when Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers grilled Apple CEO Tim Cook on its policy of refusing to let apps even acknowledge the existence of ways to pay for digital goods outside of Apple’s ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Here’s Adi Robertson on that exchange&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8J9qbe"&gt;“If they wanted to go and get a cheaper Battle Pass or V-Bucks, and they don’t know they’ve got that option, what is the problem with Apple giving them that option?” she asked.&lt;br&gt;“If we allowed people to link out like that, &lt;strong&gt;we would in essence give up our total return on our [intellectual property],&lt;/strong&gt;” Cook said bluntly. Apple has talked repeatedly about the work it puts into maintaining the App Store and the iOS platform, and it’s accused companies like Epic of wanting a free ride.&lt;br&gt;Rogers made the opposite case. “The gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it’s almost as if they’re subsidizing everybody else,” she said.&lt;br&gt;Cook countered that Apple’s many free apps attracted a larger audience than developers could get on their own. “&lt;strong&gt;We need a return on our IP. We have 150,000 APIs that we create and maintain, and numerous developer tools, and the customer service piece of dealing with all these transactions&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="K0UQEP"&gt;Cook later pointed out that by offering so many free apps on the App Store, it was bringing customers in for the paid apps as well. “I view that we are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store, and we’re doing that by focusing on getting the largest audience there,” he testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="U31T9r"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="n80HmD"&gt;Before the iPhone, carriers could (and did) point to any number of smartphones and rightfully boast about the incredible things those phones enabled. The Blackberry, the Treo, the Moto Q, and more all did things that nobody would have thought possible just a few years before. But the carriers would take credit for them while at the same time making demands that kneecapped those phones’ capabilities. They used their monopoly on wireless customers to dictate phone design, software capabilities, and business models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUNvyi"&gt;The result was a series of great phones that were still less than they could have been. I don’t know if any of them could have become the iPhone, but I do know that it wasn’t even possible because they didn’t have the leverage to tell the carriers to leave them be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eTCrnx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple broke carrier control — and kept it for itself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oE6A9A"&gt;The great irony is that the only thing that broke the dam on innovation in mobile was the iPhone itself. Steve Jobs was able to tell Cingular (now AT&amp;amp;T) to just accept whatever he made, sight unseen — and that was a key reason why the iPhone was great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMLKlS"&gt;And by continuing to keep them from meddling, the iPhone kicked off a wave of mobile innovation that’s still crashing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfuFxr"&gt;Given the opportunity again, I have no doubt that the carriers would find ways to exert control, feed the Angry God of ARPU, and thereby stifle innovation. But Apple effectively took that power away from them — but then kept it for itself. The question now is what Apple intends to do with that power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ya0LkC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WOsNLT"&gt;

    <title>Apple apparently has a spatial audio event right after today’s WWDC keynote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/97C8gYA5zEOmOk-udEa7arBQExM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415126/DSCF2672.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbWUnT"&gt;Apple appears to have planned a dedicated event on Apple Music’s upcoming spatial audio feature for later today. According to a video that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/06/apple-music-event-june7-after-wwdc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; was uploaded to &lt;em&gt;Apple Music &lt;/em&gt;as a teaser&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;it’s since been removed — Apple will broadcast a special event called “Introducing Spatial Audio.” The event doesn’t appear on the Worldwide Developers Conference schedule but is set for 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzXx0I"&gt;That is, of course, immediately after the presumed conclusion of Apple’s much anticipated 1PM ET keynote to kick off this year’s online WWDC, where the company is expected to announce its annual updates to each of its operating systems. Later in the afternoon at 5PM ET Apple will give its usual “State of the Union” presentation, which is more focused on developers than the opening keynote and addresses various technical aspects of the company’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xvwrXDo5W-2ZX2-IMMxKqj_xOTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642181/apple_music_june_7_post.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwhGpC"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; spatial audio for Apple Music last month alongside the addition of lossless files to the streaming service. Spatial audio will work with AirPods, built-in speakers on Apple devices, and third-party headphones, and should provide more immersive Dolby Atmos mixes compared to regular stereo audio. Apple previously said the feature would launch in June, so a mention of the release date at the WWDC keynote wouldn’t have been surprising, but it seems the company wants to give it a little more time in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="323wVv"&gt;For more on what to expect at WWDC today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;here’s our preview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple heads into developer conference under more scrutiny than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_f6blu4byEVOq4Ae1XSs1u-Jmo=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69413334/wwdc_scrutiny.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z1fpLh"&gt;Apple needs a distraction, and it needs one fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kv4Hd"&gt;On Monday, the company will hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-wwdc"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt;) during one of the most fraught moments for developer relations in Apple history. While Apple emerged from the Epic v. Apple trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;in a seemingly strong legal position&lt;/a&gt;, its reputation took a body blow. Evidence revealed the company &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;“treat every developer the same”&lt;/a&gt; — it cut special deals with big companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and Hulu and made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;arbitrary&lt;/a&gt;, cutthroat decisions to lock competition out and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;lock users in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zUWB7"&gt;Developers have known or suspected these things for years, and at first, online reactions seemed muted. This is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647249/wwdc-apple-parental-control-app-store-mdm-spotify-moderation-developers-2019"&gt;third year&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;in a row&lt;/a&gt; that the shadow of antitrust regulation has hung over WWDC, after all, and so far the company has largely emerged unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d9ZWem"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“We treat every developer the same.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/BsxsXhMiRB"&gt;https://t.co/BsxsXhMiRB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/XGA2J1hV6b"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XGA2J1hV6b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1390305227174252547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2IBSWl"&gt;But Apple watchers were hearing something else in the company’s testimony during the trial, something even devout developers couldn’t ignore: Apple was building its case on the idea that Apple, &lt;em&gt;not developers&lt;/em&gt;, was solely responsible for the success of the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oObTNI"&gt;Some of those developers are now supremely unhappy. So it would be fortunate if Apple has a new MacBook Pro waiting for them, one that could swing the conversation at WWDC away from difficult questions about whether the App Store is fair.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Marco Arment’s tweets on May 11th slam Apple for shitting on developers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbCNShZc48KHH-OOILMvXMa5YXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22639655/marco_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tweets by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101013243432960" target="_blank"&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;By May 11th, developers had noted the tone of Apple’s testimony &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101013243432960" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;was clear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RKlzG7"&gt;On May 21st, Tim Cook himself made Apple’s position crystal-clear: “I view that we are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Cook told Judge Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, when she questioned whether Apple didn’t necessarily deserve all the credit for keeping users around. Later, Cook insisted Apple would get paid no matter what gets decided in court: “We would have to come up with an alternate way of collecting our commission,” he told the judge, if alternative app payment mechanisms become a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyimkW"&gt;We’ve seen rent-seeking behavior from Apple in the past: remember when it forced Hey, WordPress and others to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;add in-app purchases to their &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; apps&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;were too scared to speak up?&lt;/a&gt; “These apps do not offer in-app purchase — and, consequently, have not contributed any revenue to the App Store over the last eight years,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation#kmmNsE"&gt;the company told&lt;/a&gt; Hey developer Basecamp, as if paying rent was the only value that Basecamp had ever brought to the iPhone. Now, we’re learning that entitled perspective goes all the way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="It7IaP"&gt;I thought Nick Heer &lt;a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/epic-v-apple-ends/"&gt;put it well:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3ErNWV"&gt;If you thought before that Apple was an overly controlling corporate giant that squeezed money at every possible opportunity, its executives’ testimony reinforced that. Even if you are comfortable with Apple’s business case, Tim Cook’s cold remarks must have shaken some of that confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jexU4b"&gt;And this past Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-developers-grow-app-store-ecosystem-billings-and-sales-by-24-percent-in-2020/"&gt;when Apple issued&lt;/a&gt; what his fellow podcast hosts &lt;a href="https://atp.fm/433"&gt;called a “self-serving puff piece,”&lt;/a&gt; prominent iOS developer Marco Arment apparently decided he’d been shaken enough. “[T]o bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple’s feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting,” writes Arment, in a fiery new blog post titled “&lt;a href="https://marco.org/2021/06/03/developer-relations"&gt;Developer relations&lt;/a&gt;” that’s sweeping through Apple’s dev community just days ahead of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5usCD"&gt;“It isn’t the App Store that has enabled all of the commerce on iOS,” Arment challenges Cook: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="c2vDav"&gt;It’s the entire world of computing and modern society, created by a symbiotic ecosystem in which Apple played one part alongside many others. The world was already moving in this direction, and had Apple not played its part, someone else would’ve. The App Store is merely one platform’s forced distribution gateway, “facilitating” the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6iK953"&gt;This is the part where Apple would argue that the App Store is far more — it’s designed to be a safe, curated, trustworthy experience where you can download apps without fear, which takes investment and a lot of work. But as we learned during the trial, the head of Apple’s own FEAR (Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk) team believed that Apple’s App Review program was a joke, “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d3Kgs3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is no one reviewing these apps? Is no one minding the store? This is insane!!!!!!!” - Phil Schiller, 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IjXxPw"&gt;Internal emails also revealed Apple’s own executives couldn’t believe some of the things App Review let into the public sphere, and yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;obvious scams continue to flourish&lt;/a&gt; today. While Apple now says its teams &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/"&gt;stop billions of dollars in fraud&lt;/a&gt; and employ a range of automated tools to detect malicious apps, it also admitted that it only has 500 people reviewing the 1.8 million apps on the store. (500 is not a lot of people to moderate a platform run by the most profitable company in the world, one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;made an estimated $64 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store alone.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVvWJt"&gt;One of Epic’s key arguments during the trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;was that the App Store is &lt;em&gt;ludicrously&lt;/em&gt; profitable&lt;/a&gt;, with margins so high (78 percent) they seem like the “Apple tax” that Apple’s long been accused of creating. And while Apple initially said it would refute that figure during the trial, the company instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business#:~:text=4%5D%20the%20app%20store%20is%20wildly%20profitable%2C%20but%20apple%20won%E2%80%99t%20admit%20it"&gt;repeatedly insisted it didn’t know&lt;/a&gt; how much profit the App Store actually makes. The best it could do was lay out a laundry list of things it doesn’t count against its App Store budget and presumably pays for out of the goodness of its heart, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440629/apple-app-store-physical-purchases-400-billion-50-million-wwdc"&gt;the $50 million a year it spends on WWDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHllMm"&gt;Which brings us to Monday’s developer conference, and how Apple might salvage this mess. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101898191245314"&gt;Like Arment&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t think Apple will suddenly announce that developers can use whichever payment processors they like, or even allow them to steer their customers to ways to pay outside Apple’s ecosystem. There’s also next to no chance Apple will reduce its cut. For one thing, the company’s been &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clear about its stance on each of these throughout the trial, and it’s not going to give up until the lawsuit is over (and even then, not until after rounds of appeals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYHqaG"&gt;Besides, Apple may not feel the need for anything that drastic. While a number of prominent Apple developers and bloggers have gone loud and coverage of the trial may have made Apple slightly less of a media darling — “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/opinion/apple-app-store-fortnite-lawsuit.html"&gt;The Apple Tax is Rotten&lt;/a&gt;,” declared Farhad Manjoo at the New York Times — there are plenty of developers who are simply happy to have a business at all. Having surveyed over 380 software developers ahead of WWDC, Creative Strategies principal analyst Ben Bajarin tells me that smaller developers tend to be satisfied with Apple as a whole, and over 90 percent of developers surveyed so far say they’re likely to keep developing for Apple’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdaBlp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A few observations from preliminary results from our Apple software developers study. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Small developers (those making well less than $1m a year) seem to have much higher positive sentiment toward Apple/App Store than those developers who are larger. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Uk1U5gecUu"&gt;https://t.co/Uk1U5gecUu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenBajarin/status/1400539719490965507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsFxu9"&gt;“There are still pain points, everyone wants Apple to do better, but there’s this demographic that recognizes Apple provides them value, allows them to do the thing they want to do by being a small indie developer,” he says. While many survey respondents complained about the app review process and a lack of clear communication from Apple, and the “vast majority” said Apple could be doing more about scams, even the more vocal developers plan to stay. “You listen to these very vocal developers who are unhappy...  if a viable alternative existed for them, they’d switch, but Apple’s platform and ecosystem is just such a good ecosystem for them. They won’t go to Android, they won’t go to Windows, because they won’t make the same amount of money,” Bajarin says. There’s no viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Agoro"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Where are developers gonna go?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UPdq6M"&gt;Prominent dev&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith"&gt; Steve Troughton-Smith&lt;/a&gt; feels similarly, when I ask him what Apple needs to do this year to win developers over: “the realistic [answer] is ‘nothing’ — where are developers gonna go? They gotta stick with the App Store if they want to make money on mobile, and there really aren’t other options.” He says the majority of developers “don’t know or care about the trial, and they’re happy to build apps within the sandbox that don’t try to push the boundaries or run into existential issues — which is totally fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0Xcyp"&gt;“But I think we’ve lost a decade of innovation at the fringe because of Apple’s nannying, and it gets harder to ignore as Apple is now reaching into apps and trying to dictate their business models,” he adds, referencing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;Apple’s forced in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; as one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo6qqy"&gt;Apple columnist and podcaster &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell"&gt;Jason Snell&lt;/a&gt; agrees that Apple “denigrated their developers” during the trial, but also doesn’t expect them to fix that at WWDC: “Short of changing long-held App Store policies, like allowing linking to web sites for alternate payment methods, I’m not sure what they can do other than power through their next round of OS updates and hope developers get caught up in what’s new and forget what Apple said about the role of third-party developers on the stand,” he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLUj0S"&gt;But I’m betting Apple has another way to take our minds off developer concerns, a plan that’s worked for Apple in the past — a shiny new piece of hardware that’ll make the company’s “pros” excited to work on what’s next. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TwnxEvriVAZ44lI1EUnbjLhKA3A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407714/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A hint at AR glasses, or just someone who likes what they see on this Mac?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dtE24G"&gt;Maybe it’ll be a preview of Apple’s long-awaited AR glasses. That would certainly dominate the headlines and be the talk of the show all week and beyond. While the rumor mill isn’t expecting a product to arrive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;until 2022 at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Cook has been talking up the potential of AR for years, calling it “profound,” “huge,” a “core technology,” “as big an idea as the smartphone,” and most recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;calling the tech “critically important”&lt;/a&gt; to Apple’s future. The company’s own WWDC teaser image above definitely makes me think about augmented reality, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlqpYi"&gt;But a safer bet is that, for the third time in the post-Steve Jobs era, Apple will use WWDC to remind its “pro” users that it knows how to build a Mac at the intersection of power and flexibility. “Can’t innovate anymore, my ass,” said Apple exec Phil Schiller at WWDC 2013, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4412350/apple-new-mac-pro-wwdc-2013"&gt;introducing the radically redesigned cylindrical Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a quote designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4423844/cant-innovate-anymore-my-ass-apple"&gt;to distract from the actual criticism&lt;/a&gt; the company was facing that year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="phil schiller mac pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dui-NzKt5E3I83PJn08iYsvBpuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14361890/Screen_Shot_2013-06-12_at_4.06.55_PM.1419979641.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phil Schiller, announcing the 2013 Mac Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ezcra9"&gt;He also claimed that the 2013 Mac Pro was “without a doubt the future of the pro desktop” and while that turned out to be so embarrassingly wrong that Apple wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission"&gt;publicly admitting that 2013 Mac was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;, the company pulled the same move at WWDC 2019 with its new, improved, and actually-upgradable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/6/5/18652409/apple-mac-pro-design-comparison-cheese-grater-upgrade-old-vs-new-trash-can"&gt;cheese grater Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; to show — once again — that it’s listening to its most vocal audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUaKBv"&gt;2021 gives Apple a new opportunity. Five years ago, Apple killed off the beloved MacBook Pro with Retina Display, trading its pro-friendly SD card slot, full-size HDMI and USB ports and deep, familiar keyboard for a new machine with a gimmicky Touch Bar and a set of USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports that required dongles to plug practically anything into the machine. Developers were disappointed by its lack of RAM, too. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-microsoft-macbook-pro-surface-studio-creative-professionals/"&gt;“Apple’s new MacBook Pro isn’t for pros,”&lt;/a&gt; I wrote at the time. My colleague Vlad: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13548052/the-macbook-pro-lie"&gt;“The MacBook Pro is a lie.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMQywk"&gt;Yet the biggest issue with the new MacBook Pro turned out to be its ultra-thin “butterfly keyboard,” a design so susceptible to dust that it inspired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18284042/apple-macbook-keyboard-apology-issues-bad-design"&gt;its own public apology from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18634932/apple-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-repair-reassure-worrying"&gt;multiple recall / repair programs&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344397/apple-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-switches-defective-class-action-lawsuit-certified"&gt;certified class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. We called it one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/27/21270299/apple-butterfly-keyboard-hardware-design-macbook-pro-physical-key-button"&gt;worst buttons ever made&lt;/a&gt;, and breathed a sigh of relief when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;2019’s MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; phased it out for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vmIX5T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple knows its most important critics love a high-end Mac&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="08e0FQ"&gt;But 2019’s MacBook Pro mostly just fixed 2016’s mistakes — and where pros are concerned, 2020’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s new M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t quite get there. It is essentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt; an M1 MacBook Air with an added fan&lt;/a&gt;, the same two ports and the same maximum 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfHpeV"&gt;At WWDC 2021, Apple can show that it’s listening again, and by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s account, it will: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;we’re expecting to see&lt;/a&gt; a new 16-inch MacBook Pro that brings back the SD card slot and HDMI port, heralds the return of Apple’s beloved trip-friendly MagSafe connector, trades the annoying Touch Bar for physical function keys, and supports up to 64GB of RAM. They’re also expected to include double the high-performance CPU cores and at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; double the GPU cores of the Apple M1 chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;that already managed to upend our concept of laptop performance&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjcOTq"&gt;It sounds like Apple may be giving its professional users exactly what they’ve asked for in a new laptop, for the first time in many years, and many of those pros are the same developers attending WWDC and building for iOS. A shiny distraction won’t help Apple win at trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;or stave off Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt;, but it could certainly help change the tone of developer conversations this week at WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwCoYe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zllFV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees push back against returning to the office in internal letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GCTTu1RK2SvQ48pwnzR5gvDR58E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69409300/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rit5s"&gt;Apple employees are pushing back against a new policy that would require them to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Staff members say they want a flexible approach where those who want to work remote can do so, according to an internal letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FS3kub"&gt;“We would like to take the opportunity to communicate a growing concern among our colleagues,” the letter says. “That Apple’s remote/location-flexible work policy, and the communication around it, have already forced some of our colleagues to quit. Without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; being a part of Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcqkLF"&gt;The move comes just two days after Tim Cook sent out a note to Apple employees saying  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;they would need return to the office on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays&lt;/a&gt; starting in the fall. Most employees can work remotely twice a week. They can also be remote for up to two weeks a year, pending manager approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDz5Y8"&gt;It’s an easing of restrictions compared to Apple’s previous company culture, which famously discouraged employees from working from home prior to the pandemic. Yet it’s still more conservative compared to other tech giants. Both Twitter and Facebook have told employees they can work from home forever, even after the pandemic ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YwWV2X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A clear divide&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iFDei0"&gt;For some Apple workers, the current policy doesn’t go far enough, and shows a clear divide between how Apple executives and employees view remote work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rbKhx"&gt;“Over the last year we often felt not just unheard, but at times actively ignored,” the letter says. “Messages like, ‘we know many of you are eager to reconnect in person with your colleagues back in the office,’ with no messaging acknowledging that there are directly contradictory feelings amongst us feels dismissive and invalidating...It feels like there is a disconnect between how the executive team thinks about remote / location-flexible work and the lived experiences of many of Apple’s employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNhrWZ"&gt;The letter, addressed to Tim Cook, started in a Slack channel for “remote work advocates” which has roughly 2,800 members. About 80 people were involved in writing and editing the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9StMcc"&gt;Apple employees say that embracing remote work is paramount for the company’s diversity and inclusion efforts. “For inclusion and diversity to work, we have to recognize how different we all are, and with those differences, come different needs and different ways to thrive,” they say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gvp6LU"&gt;Here are the specific asks outlined by employees in the note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nSJ0Q8"&gt;We are formally requesting that Apple considers remote and location-flexible work decisions to be as autonomous for a team to decide as are hiring decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDEzWK"&gt;We are formally requesting a company-wide recurring short survey with a clearly structured and transparent communication / feedback process at the company-wide level, organization-wide level, and team-wide level, covering topics listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0J7Kju"&gt;We are formally requesting a question about employee churn due to remote work be added to exit interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAWpbQ"&gt;We are formally requesting a transparent, clear plan of action to accommodate disabilities via onsite, offsite, remote, hybrid, or otherwise location-flexible work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gwYRd"&gt;We are formally requesting insight into the environmental impact of returning to onsite in-person work, and how permanent remote-and-location-flexibility could offset that impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="P3kQoz"&gt;The letter was sent out for Apple employees to sign late Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqGW6r"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fR6ftS"&gt;Read the full letter below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="SHvu9z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10592033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Here’s why you can’t use the Siri Remote’s best feature on Disney Plus and other apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rae05jsZeZ7Xy96tJWJe7bcRUQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408279/DSCF3939.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The redesigned Siri Remote for Apple TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEFtbk"&gt;Apple’s new Siri Remote introduced a gesture that makes it easy to scrub through content by turning the control pad into a scroll wheel. But a number of Apple TV users noticed that the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518296/apple-new-siri-remote-hbo-max-disney-plus"&gt;doesn’t work properly&lt;/a&gt; on some services, like HBO Max, or at all on others, like Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQyWtu"&gt;A spokesperson for Disney Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature — one of the best on the redesigned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; — isn’t supported on its service. It’s not a service issue, though, but instead related to custom video players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2k9Pz"&gt;Some streaming apps available on Apple TV use their own players, while others use the tvOS media player. The jogging gesture works with streaming apps that use Apple’s native media player, but it is not yet supported for third-party developers that use a custom media player, and that includes Disney’s streaming titan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ezjArd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The feature is supported on apps that use the tvOS media player, which Disney Plus does not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KEE18v"&gt;What that means is that beyond just Disney Plus, the scrubbing tool may not work for any video app that uses its own media player. It’s not clear when exactly Apple will make the feature available to these app developers. But the Disney spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Disney Plus does plan to develop the tool for its own service once it does eventually become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wcucg6"&gt;The issue had been the topic of discussion in a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; from user batsforbreakfast21, who noted experiencing issues on Disney Plus but not other services like Netflix and Apple TV Plus. Other users expressed having issues with HBO Max and Peacock as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0ymlh"&gt;Neither Peacock nor HBO Max immediately returned requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI4rcS"&gt;Ideally, the issue will be resolved quickly. Until then, the older and often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;unfairly maligned Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t seem so bad, right? Anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14 basics: how to quit an app on your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fgEerp6jUFsMW4StV7QQVqy-HvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406377/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBAgE4"&gt;Even iOS apps occasionally misbehave — they can crash, or freeze, or otherwise stop working. If you’re new to iOS, or just haven’t had this happen before, you may not know how to actually quit an app (as opposed to just swiping it off your screen). Here’s how to quit an app using iOS 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fFpjG3"&gt;Open the App Switcher by either swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then pausing in the middle, or (if you have a Home button) double pressing the Home button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vYnTbm"&gt;You’ll see an overlapping view of all your open apps. Swipe to the right or left until you find the app you want to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HZCbTg"&gt;Swipe up on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app you want to quit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpaPAZ_gFiuw50kCvgvDaYPH8j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554891/IMG_A27F4BD48743_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe it up to quit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h3_ou0hV4pgpbnjCrn9sFtkrgrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554901/IMG_9FA2A8039FFE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe it up to quit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n10e51"&gt;Unfortunately, there isn’t any way to close all of your apps at once, should you wish to do so — you’ll have to simply swipe them off one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtwsFo"&gt;If for any reason swiping the app off doesn’t solve the problem, then &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/restart-iphone-iph841379c3d/14.0/ios/14.0"&gt;shut down your phone&lt;/a&gt; by pressing and holding the side button and either volume button until you see sliders appear. Drag the one that says “slide to power off” to the right. (If you have an iPhone with a Home button, instead, press and hold the side or the Sleep / Wake button.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLm1Bc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
