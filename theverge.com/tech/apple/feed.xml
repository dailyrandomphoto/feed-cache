    <title>Brydge’s Pro Plus iPad keyboard gets much better trackpad support with new firmware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gz2ot_feK6QKxMzoBK4LczmOdR4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830902/DSC00760.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aeq4bm"&gt;Brydge has announced a new firmware update for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;Pro Plus iPad keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that promises to hugely improve the trackpad experience. The update brings “native” multitouch to the trackpads, meaning you can use the same kind of multi-finger gestures on a Brydge device as Apple’s own Magic Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMzPc0"&gt;The Brydge Pro Plus was the victim of unfortunate timing. It was originally announced as a power-user product designed to support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18743993/ipad-mouse-ipad-os-how-to"&gt;experimental cursor feature&lt;/a&gt;, but then Apple turned that into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/18/21184933/ipados-13-4-mouse-trackpad-support-ipad-apple-computer-date"&gt;consumer-level functionality&lt;/a&gt; with iOS 13.4 and released its own keyboard/trackpad accessory, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;expensive but excellent Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. At launch, the Pro Plus’ trackpad was usable for basic tasks, but it didn’t have full gesture support and couldn’t compete with the smoothness of Apple’s own hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iOhmE1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brydge Pro Plus review: an almost awesome iPad laptop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vLCQyi"&gt;I’ve spent a couple of days with a beta version of Brydge’s new firmware, using the company’s keyboard designed for the 11-inch iPad, and the news is good so far. While the trackpad on this model is quite small, and its levered mechanism means there isn’t a lot of space for clicking, the cursor movement is far smoother and gestures work well. You can use three fingers to swipe between apps, for example, or swipe up to bring you to the multitasking interface. Simple two-finger scrolling is also much improved, working with consistent momentum as you’d expect across various apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQoBB1"&gt;I’ll have to test the Pro Plus’ new firmware further before giving a final verdict, but my first impressions are positive. The Pro Plus looks like it’ll soon be a much more viable product than it was upon its original launch, particularly since Brydge is putting it on sale today; the 12.9-inch model is getting a $60 reduction to $169.99, while the 11-inch version is available for $40 off at $159.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n1X3Uq"&gt;Brydge is also announcing a new trackpad-equipped iPad keyboard, the first product to come out of a collaboration with OtterBox that was &lt;a href="http://news.brydge.com/111070-brydge-announces-go-to-market-collaboration-with-otter-products"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt;. The 10.2 Max Plus is designed for the seventh- and eighth generation iPads with 10.2-inch displays, and includes a detachable case that Brydge says offers 4-foot drop protection. It’s set to ship in late March and will be &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-10-2-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287000%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to preorder today&lt;/a&gt; for $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPVa8E"&gt;If you already have a Pro Plus keyboard, meanwhile, Brydge is opening signups for a public beta of the new firmware. You can register &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fpages%2Fmulti-touch-beta&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287000%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; the page notes that the firmware will require an iPad running Apple’s iPadOS 14.5 public beta. The program will begin on March 3rd, but 500 users will get earlier access on February 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games brings Apple fight to the EU with new antitrust complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FfoJ2jwG5QC9WTDp8EHNXq33q8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829189/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="owZZU4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games has made a formal antitrust complaint about Apple to the European Commission, the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-eu-antitrust-complaint-against-apple"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Epic alleges that Apple’s “carefully designed anti-competitive restrictions” have “completely eliminated competition in app distribution and payment processes.” It says this leads to consumers playing higher prices, and gives Apple too much control over developers on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geMeM2"&gt;The complaint is the latest legal action taken by Epic in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know/archives"&gt;ongoing dispute with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The developer has criticized Apple’s control over software distribution with the App Store, as well as its policies around payments, which often result in Apple taking a 30 percent cut of in-app purchases. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has called this 30 percent cut a “tax,” and Epic claims Apple’s policies give its own services an unfair advantage over other iOS developers. In November, Apple said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;reduce its App Store commission rate to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for any developer that earns less than $1 million in annual revenue, in an apparent response to pressure from developers and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2iCJC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic wants “timely and effective remedies” from the EU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zuHcZa"&gt;In its announcement, Epic Games said it’s not seeking damages from Apple in the EU. Instead, it says it wants “timely and effective remedies” to address what it claims are Apple’s anti-competitive practices. “We just want to see prohibition on these platform companies using their control over the hardware to exert control over secondary markets and force them to compete on equal terms with every competitor,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e1259614-d954-400f-9265-f39a36c8c0c6"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when asked what these remedies should include. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwDVCL"&gt;Epic’s dispute with Apple erupted last summer when the developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;attempted to circumvent&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Apple responded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removing the popular game from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;, only for Epic Games to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;file a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in response. Epic has subsequently &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/freefortnite-australia-press-release"&gt;launched legal proceedings in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/epic-widens-fortnite-access-dispute-with-apple-google-in-u-k?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;complained to the UK’s antitrust tribunal&lt;/a&gt; about Apple’s actions. Epic Games and Apple are due to meet in court in May, according to the &lt;em&gt;FT. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qICjs"&gt;As well as challenging Apple, Epic also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;sued Google&lt;/a&gt; after it removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from Android’s Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ruv2OL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euiSHuaw6Q4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qg8auo"&gt;Responding to Epic’s latest filing, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/epic-games-attacks-apple-in-complaint-to-eu-antitrust-watchdog?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Epic had intentionally violated its App Store policies, and that these “apply equally to every developer and protect customers.” It said Epic’s actions “made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to the European Commission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8sosu"&gt;Epic’s new complaint follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;EU’s announcement last year&lt;/a&gt; that it has opened a formal antitrust investigation against Apple over its App Store and Apple Pay practices. The EU is concerned that Apple’s policies stifle and distort competition in cases where Apple’s own services compete with other developers on its App Store. Messaging app Telegram &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/88589fc5-8410-4274-859c-d27b3d83fe20"&gt;has also complained to the EU&lt;/a&gt; about Apple’s policies, demanding that it allow users to download software outside of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iOS 14.5 emoji promote inclusivity, vaccines, and the AirPods Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xm9RmEwgnIpNePWUfHMq9IuWZjo=/0x0:809x539/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68827365/Newios14.5emoji.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaA86G"&gt;As part of iOS 14.5, Apple is adding new emoji from the Unicode Consortium’s Emoji 13.1 release, including skin tone options for some popular emoji and several new smiley faces and hearts. The company is also making some changes to other emoji that are already available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90fJIf"&gt;The new changes to skin tone and gender presentation are probably the most important to note. Popular emoji like “Couples Kissing” and “Couples with Heart” now have many more skin tone variations for all options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xwUHU4LciSJ8wqetLXp50w4hYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307939/couples_with_skin_tones_ios_14_5_emojipedia.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Emojipedia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skin tone variations for the “Couples with Heart” emoji in iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IR7hYh"&gt;In addition to more skin tones, the bearded emoji has also been adjusted to allow for not just the neutral “Person:Beard” but also “Man:Beard” and “Woman:Beard.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The various beard options in iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOQrNN"&gt;Apple’s update also includes its take on the new smiley faces included in the Unicode Consortium’s newest emoji set, including “Exhaling Face,” “Face with Spiral Eyes,” and “Face in Clouds.” Hearts, another emoji go-to category, also has two new members joining its ranks, “Heart on Fire” and “Mending Heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IddUj2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10345995"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EzyeSy"&gt;All of these emoji were approved by the Unicode Consortium &lt;a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2020/09/emoji-131-now-final-to-be-widely.html"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that vendors could begin integrating them into their products and services at that time. But it’s up to the individual companies to design how emoji look on their devices and services, which is why a smiley face on your iPhone looks different than it does on Twitter. Companies also decide when the new emoji show up — Pixel users, for example, have been able to use the new emoji &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/08/december-patch-brings-unicode-13-1-emoji-to-pixel-devices/"&gt;since December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCztZt"&gt;Apple is also making tweaks to some existing emoji, however: the rock-climbing emoji will now feature a helmet, the syringe emoji is now a more generic one rather than one filled with blood, and the headphones look like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVT3iw"&gt;The syringe change could be a legitimately helpful one for anyone writing about COVID-19. Not only is the new syringe way less intimidating when emptied of blood, but it’s also more applicable to vaccinations, which will hopefully become a lot more common soon. Check out this comparison from Emojipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f2QFNC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple has removed the blood from the syringe emoji in iOS 14.5, making it more versatile to represent vaccination   &lt;a href="https://t.co/tdSiIYB0gI"&gt;https://t.co/tdSiIYB0gI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/3R5gL83Cdz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3R5gL83Cdz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emojipedia (@Emojipedia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Emojipedia/status/1361745569635573775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LgyrLM"&gt;Changing the headphones emoji to resemble AirPods Max, on the other hand, follows a known pattern: Apple regularly inserts its own products into its emoji set as a form of free product placement. (Apple’s mobile phone emoji &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/mobile-phone/"&gt;looks a lot like an iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, for example.) If you want to see just how different the new headphones emoji is, Emojipedia &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Emojipedia/status/1361750732643459075"&gt;made that comparison&lt;/a&gt;, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MFFdNw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In iOS 14.5 beta 2, the   Headphone emoji now displays as AirPods Max &lt;a href="https://t.co/cGkn3ir0G9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cGkn3ir0G9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emojipedia (@Emojipedia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Emojipedia/status/1361750732643459075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sep5W8"&gt;Apple says all of these emoji are available in the new release of the iOS 14.5 beta, which also comes with a nice little change to the Apple Music app. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ll9zje/feature_ios_145_beta_2_swipe_actions_in_music/"&gt;users on Reddit running the beta&lt;/a&gt;, you can now add and remove music from your queue with the same kind of swiping gesture used in Apple’s Mail app to archive, delete, or flag emails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTW4wK"&gt;The full release of iOS 14.5 is also said to include several other helpful additions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;support for the new Xbox and PlayStation controllers&lt;/a&gt;, the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify"&gt;to set Siri’s default music streaming&lt;/a&gt; service to Spotify, and the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;unlock your phone with your Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2e55r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 16th, 8:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added context about the new emoji and the changes to older emoji in iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple won’t have to allow App Store alternatives on iOS after North Dakota bill fails</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbKvVmsB-rnvL4XA1KzSwsgTMA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68827252/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mWGwSx"&gt;A North Dakota bill that would have drastically altered the way app store operators like Apple and Google manage their digital marketplaces has failed to garner enough votes, failing in the state senate by an 11-36 vote on Tuesday, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karlarosehanson/status/1361780107619094530"&gt;North Dakota House of Representatives member Karla Rose Hanson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBUfLi"&gt;The bill, SB 2333, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276511/north-dakota-senate-bill-2333-apple-google-app-store-antitrust-monopoly"&gt;stirred considerable controversy last week&lt;/a&gt; when a committee hearing drew the attention of corporate lawyers and lobbyists, experts, and Apple critics arguing both in favor and against the proposed legislation’s potentially far-reaching consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArGIFk"&gt;The bill would have barred any company in the business of software distribution making over $10 million in annual revenue from imposing rules on developers dictating they only use one app store, like the App Store or the Google Play Store, and that they have to use the app store owner’s preferred payment system. Using Apple or Google’s payment system, in turn, lets those companies take 30 percent of most sales, per their long-standing revenue sharing policies around app sales and in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3nYDh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple said the bill would “destroy the iPhone as you know it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QyuXVG"&gt;Requiring developers to use the App Store and Apple’s own payment system are pillars of the iPhone maker’s mobile business and largely responsible for the App Store’s continued financial success. The App Store is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to have generated more than $64 billion&lt;/a&gt; in revenue last year. (Google does allow alternative app stores onto Android, but the company requires users to click through security warnings to download and use such software.) Yet, developers have long complained of Apple’s grip on the flow of revenue on iOS, with critics claiming its ever-changing rules are inconsistently applied and that Apple grants exemptions on a case-by-case basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtfIBU"&gt;Although the bill would only have dictated how companies like Apple operate within the state of North Dakota, the bill’s broad language may have forced Apple to make systemic changes to its business nationwide. The legislation’s success could have also inspired other states to follow suit with similar attempts to regulate app stores’ relationships with developers, although that appears to be already underway despite SB 2333’s failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpBMt6"&gt;In arguing against SB 2333, Apple’s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, testified that the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it,” arguing that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in,” Neuenschwander concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="afeGMT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;North Dakota’s app store bill might have had far-reaching consequences for Apple and Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0spRQA"&gt;The legislation is just one of a growing number of state bills, which now includes proposed bills in Arizona and Georgia, that seek to place limits on the power of Apple and fellow app store owners. A &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;report this weekend&lt;/a&gt; linked the bills to a multi-state lobbying effort from the Coalition for App Fairness, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;industry group formed last fall&lt;/a&gt; consisting of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;creator Epic Games, Tinder parent company Match Group, Spotify, and dozens of other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHNq3Z"&gt;The CAF’s members have for years railed against the App Store and Apple’s mandate that it take 30 percent of all app sales and in-app purchases. The group is now dedicating its efforts to supporting legislation taking aim at Apple and its App Store policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ybrKQ"&gt;SB 2333 was proposed by Sen. Kyle Davison (R-Fargo) after the state senator was approached by Lacee Bjork Anderson, a lobbyist with the firm Odney Public Affairs based in Bismarck, North Dakota who gave a draft proposal to Davison. Anderson, it turns out, was hired by both the CAF and Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFXQ68"&gt;Epic is also suing Apple and Google after both companies removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last August, following Epic’s decision to include its own in-app payment system in the iOS and Android versions of the battle royale hit. Epic was not the only CAF member that submitted testimony supporting SB 2333; Basecamp. Match Group, and Tile all submitted testimony, too, a CAF spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Al1fCl"&gt;In a tweet, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney acknowledged Epic and the Coalition for App Fairness’ participation in the ongoing lobbying efforts. “North Dakota’s effort to combat app store monopolies is awesome for consumers and developers,” Sweeney wrote. “The Coalition for App Fairness organized the outreach, lobbying, and developer participation. Can’t take credit for it, but Epic is proud to be a part of it!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vEkMG0"&gt;

    <title>If your Apple Watch still won’t charge after the latest update, Apple will fix it for free</title>

  &lt;p id="0foekY"&gt;Apple released watchOS 7.3.1 on Monday, and it could help fix an issue that prevents some Apple Watch Series 5 or SE smartwatches from charging while in the battery-saving Power Reserve Mode. But even the software update might not fix the issue, according to Apple. If it doesn’t, the company will repair your watch for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iziqA4"&gt;“A very small number of customers with Apple Watch Series 5 or Apple Watch SE models running watchOS 7.2 or 7.3 have experienced an issue with their watch not charging after it enters Power Reserve,” Apple says &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212180"&gt;in a support document&lt;/a&gt;. If your Apple Watch still won’t charge after installing the update and after you put it on a charger for at least 30 minutes, the company asks that you contact Apple Support to set up a free mail-in repair. The company will have to inspect your watch to “verify that it’s eligible for free repair.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMS6U2"&gt;The watchOS 7.3.1 update is available for download now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nissan says it’s not in Apple car discussions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2018 nissan leaf" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9CRTG2kR4apNpQ_S-7KLYBdTiM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68819313/DSCF5396.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DZgQam"&gt;Nissan has issued a statement denying that it’s in discussions to work with Apple on the US company’s long-rumored autonomous car project. Earlier today &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/29d4aa6b-fba5-4a53-876e-3f097fdef1d2"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had approached the Japanese automaker about a potential partnership “in recent months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWQHhr"&gt;“We are not in talks with Apple,” a Nissan spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-tech-apple-nissan/update-2-nissan-says-not-in-talks-with-apple-over-autonomous-car-project-idUSL1N2KL01Y"&gt;tells Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. “However, Nissan is always open to exploring collaborations and partnerships to accelerate industry transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LzT1u"&gt;That statement doesn’t address whether the talks ever took place, which means it doesn’t directly contradict the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;’ story. That report said that “the contact was brief and the discussions did not advance to senior management levels following divisions over branding for the iPhone maker’s electric vehicles.” The breaking point was said to be Apple’s request that Nissan manufacture cars carrying Apple’s branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6CK8Ol"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hyundai and Kia downplay Apple car rumors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271748/hyundai-apple-car-talks-stopped-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PQHSwK"&gt; “We have our own customer satisfaction, which comes by car. No way we are going to change the way we make cars,” Nissan COO Ashwani Gupta tells the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times, &lt;/em&gt;again stating that talks aren’t happening now without confirming if they ever did. “The way we design, the way we develop, and the way we manufacture is going to be as an automotive manufacturer, as Nissan.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6pnpc"&gt;The recent speculation over Nissan comes after Hyundai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271748/hyundai-apple-car-talks-stopped-report"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it wasn’t in talks with Apple on the project. Hyundai has been the primary subject of rumors over the partnership of late, not least because the Korean carmaker itself issued and swiftly retracted a statement saying it had entered discussions with Apple. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;believes&lt;/a&gt; the first Apple car will be built on Hyundai’s E-GMP platform and ship in 2025 at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google updates its iOS YouTube app, the first update to one of its major iOS apps since December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNQsyXB_i4OMb65ZuviVR2UJ5nM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68815471/acastro_180202_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ChPkQ2"&gt;Google has provided a bug fix to its iOS YouTube app, the first update to a major Google iOS app since December, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/12/google-youtube-iphone-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Although there’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250648/google-apple-app-store-privacy-label"&gt;speculation that the reason&lt;/a&gt; for the lack of updates to iOS versions of Gmail, Docs, Search, and Photos is an attempt to avoid Apple’s new privacy labels, Google has &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/"&gt;explicitly denied&lt;/a&gt; that was the case. The company said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe-and-control-your-privacy"&gt;January 12th blog post&lt;/a&gt; it would add the labels to its apps when updates were available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ORywLQ"&gt;As Google’s iOS apps are updated with new features or to fix bugs, you’ll see updates to our app page listings that include the new App Privacy Details. These labels represent the maximum categories of data that could be collected—meaning if you use every available feature and service in the app. The data you provide to Google products delivers helpful services to you, and you can always control your privacy settings by visiting your Google Account or going directly to the Google products you use on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UFg45x"&gt;Apple requires companies to apply the privacy labels, which it launched on December 14th, before they can update existing iOS apps. Some of Google’s other apps— Stadia, Authenticator, Translate, and Classroom, for example— have received iOS updates already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnLY97"&gt;We’ve reached out to Google to ask if updates for the iOS versions of Gmail, Search, Docs and Photos are forthcoming, and will report back if we learn more. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="wzhgrz"&gt;Apple is gearing up for the release of &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt; season 2 on Apple TV Plus. It’s kicking things off with a new augmented reality app, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F02%2Ffor-all-mankind-time-capsule-a-new-augmented-reality-experience-based-on-the-apple-tv-space-drama-is-available-today-in-the-app-store%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22278780%2Fapple-augmented-reality-ar-app-for-all-mankind-tv-plus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;: Time Capsule&lt;/a&gt;, that looks to fill in the gap between the two seasons using AR artifacts from the world of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYaejE"&gt;The app itself is a fun promotional gimmick to help promote the second season of one of Apple’s higher-profile original shows. It’s the broader strategy at play that’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-A2SPv3VJ5iEzKRt16P48rg6ZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22300211/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_11.53.26_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JJNJeK"&gt;It’s no secret that Apple is interested in AR. The recurring AR demos at the last several iPhone and iPad product announcements, the addition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185200/apple-ipad-pro-lidar-sensor-ar-hardware-solution-software-apps-augmented-reality"&gt;AR-focused LIDAR cameras&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;latest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro devices&lt;/a&gt;, and the persistent rumors of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;pending VR / AR headsets&lt;/a&gt; are all clear evidence of that. And Apple has been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-26/apple-plans-augmented-reality-content-to-boost-tv-video-service?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;rumored to be working&lt;/a&gt; on the tie-in app for a while now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bcDepD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s rumored VR headset could cost $3,000, feature 8K displays and over a dozen cameras","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7Jd0Y0"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;: Time Capsule is one of the first indications of Apple tying all of its hardware, content, and service ambitions together. It’s an augmented reality app downloaded from the App Store that prompts users to subscribe to Apple TV Plus to watch &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, with additional content for LIDAR-equipped Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ChQU3"&gt;It’s the kind of cross-promotional content that spans Apple’s wide array of businesses. It could also offer a glimpse at the kind of integrated hardware, software, and service bundle that Apple could be considering for any future AR devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xXWN-t57Q2UyqQv662Bj9KonMk=/158x0:1883x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_2021_2.7.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 is often available for less than full retail price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wFbUhR"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 / S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon — especially from OnePlus — but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hvSkHC"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is the only small phone on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vYYXqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215729"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l32PYT"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best budget phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4WMzav"&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A 5G starts at $500 and gets you access to several key features: a big-ish 6.2-inch screen, clean and uncluttered Android software, Google’s excellent Pixel camera, and of course 5G. Although buying a phone &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to get 5G is a mistake, all things being equal, it’s worth getting 5G if you can in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwyHDO"&gt;Even though the Pixel camera isn’t the very best you can get anymore, it still is competitive with phones that cost hundreds of dollars more. No other phone at this $500 ($600 on Verizon) price point can match the Pixel’s camera quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YRQbD"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a good-looking OLED screen. Just as importantly, it has the promise of getting timely software updates directly from Google. While other Android phones take forever to get the new versions of Android, Google’s get them right away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fqlnrb"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S20 FE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hEmpY9"&gt;Best midrange Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="eI71VU"&gt;Last year’s Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a Goldilocks phone. It is much more capable and powerful than budget phones like the Pixel 4A 5G, but it still costs significantly less than the newest flagship phones. Even though it came out in October 2020, it still is a completely competent device with an excellent screen, good cameras, and fairly good battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5nZhS"&gt;The “FE” in the name stands for “Fan Edition,” but the reality is that this is a phone for anybody, not just Samsung fans. To bring the price down from its flagships, Samsung changed the screen resolution to 1080p and simplified the build materials — it has a plastic back. Don’t let that last detail throw you, though, as the plastic back feels quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65JwyR"&gt;The successor to the S20 FE really is the “flagship” Galaxy S21, which has essentially the same camera system as this phone. As we’ve noted with most Samsung phones, the whole game is whether or not you can find a good deal. If the S21 and S20 FE are about the same price, go with the S21. If you can find a great price on the S20 FE, it’ll do right by you as a very solid Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s PIxel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: at $2,000, the Fold 2 is literally twice as expensive as other high-end phones. You’re paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
