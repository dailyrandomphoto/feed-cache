    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for a great Apple deal this Black Friday season, you shouldn’t shop at Apple. That’s because Apple doesn’t typically offer discounts on its new products in-store or on its website, at least outside of the occasional educational discount. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Even better, these retailers have already started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if you’re looking to save even more, make sure to check out our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re highlighting the best deals across all brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DpLcAU"&gt;The third-gen AirPods were released just last month, and now you can buy them for sale. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the true wireless earbuds for $170 instead of $179. The latest AirPods boast a MagSafe-ready charging case and shorter stems, as well as better battery life and water resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lLCckh"&gt;Apple’s second generation of true wireless earbuds, the AirPods, are selling for $109 instead of $159 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This particular model comes with a wired charging case, however, you can pick up a pair with the wireless charging case for $150 instead of $200 from &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F482532021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="nAbiSM"&gt;The 64GB, Wi-Fi version of the 10.9-inch iPad Air is selling for $539 instead of $600 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F149437127&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in rose gold, while the space gray version is just $10 extra. Released in 2020, the latest model offers thinner bezels around the display and a Touch ID sensor embedded in the power button. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RVzOFA"&gt;Last year’s M1-equipped MacBook Air is, in our opinion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;the best laptop&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. Right now, you can buy the 512GB model with 16GB of RAM for $1,399 in gold or space gray at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604840-REG%2Fapple_z125_mgn7_04_bh_13_3_macbook_air_with.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x1080441%2FSID%2Fprice-guide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22787892%2Fapple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ULdok1"&gt;Last year’s 27-inch iMac comes with an improved 1080p webcam, as well as a notable performance increase over its predecessor. Right now, you can pick it up for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Retina-Display-27-inch-Storage/dp/B08F8ZPRGW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,699&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,799 when you choose the Core i5 model with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356416/apple-imac-27-2020-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;h2 id="U7uxx5"&gt;Apple TV 4K deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zVUvIW"&gt;You can get a $50 Apple gift card when you buy an &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-4k/"&gt;Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD directly from Apple&lt;/a&gt; starting November 26th. Amazon is also discounting various configurations of the latest version by $10, selling for example the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-TV-4K-32GB/dp/B0933D3SN6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB 2021 Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; for $170 instead of $179.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="4UnRx1"&gt;The first-gen Apple Pencil is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MK0C2AM-A-Apple-Pencil/dp/B016NY7784/ref=asc_df_B016NY7784/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $80&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date. The stylus is compatible with the latest entry-level iPad and a range of earlier models, and it differs from the second-gen model in that you need to plug it into your iPad’s Lightning port in order to charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cPIw19"&gt;Apple AirTag deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YcyTlE"&gt;Apple is throwing in a $50 gift card when you buy a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag/4-pack"&gt;four-pack of AirTags&lt;/a&gt; from them directly starting November 26th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday 2021 phone deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DZmJoRq3qPSACPgLEfXKLC9DK0U=/0x0:2002x1335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70187660/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals for iPhones this year? Read on to find out.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXFrPb"&gt;Need a new phone? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are a great time to be shopping for a phone for yourself or as a gift to your nearest and dearest this holiday season. This is the time of year when retailers and carriers are dropping their best deals, whether it’s to make room for next year’s models or to sign up new cellular customers. Android users can cash in on a number of excellent deals from the likes of Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and Motorola; however, Apple is notoriously stingy when it comes to iPhone discounts. You might get a gift card or a pair of AirPods when buying an iPhone, or a carrier might offer a higher trade-in value for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"&gt;“free” iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPtDSg"&gt;Here are all the best Black Friday phone deals we’ve found so far. If possible, we recommend buying an unlocked phone, so there won’t be any strings attached to the purchase. If we include a carrier promotion, we’ll call out each requirement necessary to get the deal. Given all the supply issues many phone makers have been having all year, there might not be a lot of stock available out there. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lN9CKF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The best deals for Black Friday on true wireless earbuds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22792011/black-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The best phone to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"},{"title":"The best budget phone for under $500","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fBJR1Q"&gt;Apple iPhone Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UqdK1t"&gt;From our experience, Apple doesn’t offer price cuts on any of its iPhone models. At most, you’ll get a pair of free AirPods and / or a gift card to use toward a future purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QgRz4p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="FVnSGE"&gt;The best deal so far is on a prepaid, 64GB iPhone SE (2020), which is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FWalmart-Family-Mobile-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-64GB-Red-Prepaid-Smartphone%2F421691612%3Fathcpid%3D421691612%26athpgid%3DAthenaItempage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3Dsi%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS055%26athguid%3DNWMTEvRDxRLI2FjMmMVSPsOsaXotayIvaG6W%26athancid%3Dnull%26athposb%3D0%26athena%3Dtrue%26athbdg%3DL1300&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now $199 at Walmart with Walmart Family Mobile&lt;/a&gt; — that’s a 50 percent discount on a phone with the same chipset as the iPhone 11 and will get four years of software support from Apple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="r9e8dz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556638"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PXbynW"&gt;You can get a free pair of Beats Studio Buds in black and a virtual gift card for up to $200 if you purchase an iPhone SE and activate it on &lt;a href="https://visible.pxf.io/c/482924/976691/12909?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.visible.com%2Fdeals%2Fchoose-your-own-gift-card&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021"&gt;Visible Wireless&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll need to transfer your number and make at least three months of payments before you’ll be able to redeem your gift, however. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id="JV9Mi6"&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NwCbzf"&gt;You can get $300 on a Walmart e-gift card with the purchase of an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-iPhone-13-128GB-Midnight%2F549396996%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-iPhone-13-mini-128GB-Blue%2F634815121%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-iPhone-13-Pro-128GB-Sierra-Blue%2F932171430%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-128GB-Sierra-Blue%2F160882297%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;s&gt;iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (sold out) on either AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon. The exact amount depends on which iPhone you choose (see below), and you can also get an additional $250 Walmart e-gift card by trading in an eligible phone. The deal runs through December 3rd, but you need to activate the new phone no later than December 3rd at 11:59PM local time to take advantage of the deal. If you prefer to get this deal and trade-in squared away in person, you need to schedule an in-person appointment, starting as early as 5AM on November 26th. This in-store deal also ends on December 3rd.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of the 2021 Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals are for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g0EjRt"&gt;Samsung phone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZogOsh"&gt;This year’s Samsung phone deals aren’t much better than Apple’s: you get a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2, but there aren’t any deep price cuts unless you have some devices you can trade in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3bp5ZH"&gt;The best deal so far might be at Walmart, where you can get a &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip3-5G-Black-128-GB%2F208015415%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 Walmart gift card&lt;/a&gt; with the purchase and activation of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8RaJCW"&gt;We also dig the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FStraight-Talk-Samsung-Galaxy-S20-FE-128GB-Navy-Blue-Prepaid-Smartphone%2F660796214%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now on sale at Walmart for $249&lt;/a&gt; (limited availability). Typically $699, the flagship phone features a 6.5-inch 1080p display with a 120Hz refresh rate but in a plastic body. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full Galaxy S21 FE review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

This unlocked 5G phone has all the perks of being a Pixel but without the flagship-level pricing of the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. What you’ll get: three years of software support (including Android 12), some water protection (IP67), a 4620mAh battery, and a best-in-class camera. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s ad-supported streaming plan costs just $1 per month to join</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RBjR8hLOMw5B1TYi57QtEviL28w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70187122/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lVoLnK"&gt;Black Friday sales are in full swing, and now some popular streaming services are starting to join the party. Through November 29th, both new and returning customers who qualify for the deal can enjoy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fgma&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F24%2F22798649%2Fhulu-ad-streaming-plan-app-deal-macbook-air-m1-apple-airpods-sennheiser-sale-black-friday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12 months of Hulu’s ad-supported streaming service&lt;/a&gt; for just $1 per month. Typically $7 per month — or $84 per year — that equates to a $72 discount or about 85 percent off. While you’ll see an ad popping up every now and then with this plan, you can still access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on your TV, streaming box, tablet, laptop, console, and other devices. Two people are also allowed to simultaneously stream on this plan as well, and you can have up to six users profiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7fr8g"&gt;While newcomers to Hulu shouldn’t face any obstacles in signing up for the deal, returning customers can only reap the savings if they haven’t been a Hulu subscriber within the past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HZwhoa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10883069"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pkl0rw"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 4 is selling for its best price yet. Right now, you can save $150 on all configurations. The specific model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;we liked in our review&lt;/a&gt;, which uses an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU paired with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, is just $1,550. Compared to its predecessor, we were particularly impressed by its improved battery life and the faster AMD CPU. Other things to like about this model are its fantastic keyboard and the 3:2 aspect ratio display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijKlae"&gt;For more discounts on the Surface Go 2 and other laptops, check out some early Black Friday deals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796308/microsoft-black-friday-2021-deals-laptops-cyber-monday"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VrIY6M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;If the Surface Laptop 4 is a little out of your budget — and you’re a Costco member — you can pick up Apple’s 13.3-inch MacBook Air with an M1 processor, which is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops around&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of costing $950 and up, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/macbook-air-13.3%2522-%25e2%2580%2593-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%252c-7-core-gpu-%25e2%2580%2593-8gb-memory-%25e2%2580%2593-256gb-ssd-%25e2%2580%2593-space-gray.product.100688258.html"&gt;you can get it for $800&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price yet. This model has an eight-core Apple M1 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. In our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we gave the laptop a 9.5/10 (one of our highest scores &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;), praising the laptop’s fast performance and excellent battery life. It’s a good all-around option for many and a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even some very light gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lZJpWg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882789"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bpG75h"&gt;Less than a day after offering Apple’s $179 third-generation AirPods for just $155, Amazon sadly sold out. Thankfully, however, Woot is now offering a similar discount, selling the newest pair of Apple’s true wireless earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeAirpods3rdGeneration112321/https://www.woot.com/offers/new-apple-airpods-3rd-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $170&lt;/a&gt; instead of $179. It may not be the $15 discount Amazon was offering, but it’s still one of the lowest prices we’ve seen yet on the newly released AirPods, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;our pick&lt;/a&gt; for one of the best wireless earbuds you can buy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="paMk4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7l0C0"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of earbuds that offers solid active noise cancellation (which the newest AirPods mentioned above don’t), Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price"&gt;are a great pick&lt;/a&gt; with “sublime” sound. One of the few problems, though, is their usual $300 price. That’s twice as expensive as the likes of the AirPods, but at least with today’s deal, that is no longer the case. They’re selling for $197 when you pick up the black model. That’s just over a $100 discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bfuBxa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K6hbuX"&gt;Last but not least, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785870/verge-merch-store-black-friday-sale-2021-code-cyber-monday"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; fans can enjoy 20 percent off&lt;/a&gt; our own merchandise at &lt;a href="http://store.theverge.com/?_ga=2.146931447.191173471.1637596108-392483003.1630346675&amp;amp;_gl=1*11yslyb*_ga*MzkyNDgzMDAzLjE2MzAzNDY2NzU.*_ga_9GXHZT6RVE*MTYzNzc2NzY2NC4yODMuMS4xNjM3NzY4MjQwLjA."&gt;The Verge Merch Store&lt;/a&gt; when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEBF &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.

    <title>Twitter updates iOS app to stop tweets disappearing mid-read</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KQ6EGz"&gt;Twitter has updated its iOS app to prevent those annoying situations where tweets disappear as you’re trying to read them, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463270547706585100"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. “Now when you pause your timeline scrolling to look at a Tweet, it should stay put!” the company tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UjaGU"&gt;The updates made on iOS follow similar improvements made on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785094/twitter-auto-refresh-timeline-stop-tweets-disappear"&gt;web version of Twitter last week&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter explained that tweets can disappear when replies are being added to an ongoing conversation, because this would push existing tweets up the timeline. “We know it’s a frustrating experience, so we’re working on changing it,” the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1440766157884039170"&gt;said in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hoFeZc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve made some updates on iOS to prevent Tweets from disappearing mid-read. Now when you pause your timeline scrolling to look at a Tweet, it should stay put!&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463270547706585100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M7Bwiz"&gt;The changes have come during an unusually busy year for Twitter, where it’s been adding major new features on an almost monthly basis. Earlier this month it added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783594/twitter-blue-nuzzel-top-articles-ios-arrivial-top-articles"&gt;new summary of popular articles&lt;/a&gt; for subscribers of Twitter Blue, a paid service that itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;only launched in June this year&lt;/a&gt;. Other major new features to have been widely released this year include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753072/twitter-super-follows-subscription-ios"&gt;Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces"&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740451/twitter-revue-subscribe-newsletter-tweet"&gt;new button&lt;/a&gt; to simplify the process of subscribing to newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly switching to its own iPhone modem design in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro (left) and Pro Max (right)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coOaqfrqsJvwUlP4fi3eX8G2Ipo=/0x0:2031x1354/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186370/vpavic_210916_untitled_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rM51ne"&gt;Apple is planning to partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for the production of its own 5G modems for future iPhones, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-taps-TSMC-to-build-custom-iPhone-5G-modem-in-2023"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is said to be planning to use TSMC’s 4nm process node, which hasn’t yet been deployed for any commercial product; the modem is apparently being designed and tested at 5nm before moving to mass production in 2023 at 4nm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYPkpa"&gt;Apple’s switch to modems of its own design is widely expected to happen in 2023, and TSMC is the natural manufacturing partner. Qualcomm, which is the dominant player in the industry and produces modem components for the entire iPhone 13 lineup, recently said that it expects to account for just 20 percent of iPhone modem orders in two years’ time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HhiBJg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IAG1ZF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;Apple bought Intel’s 5G modem division in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, foreshadowing the eventual switch. Earlier that year Qualcomm and Apple agreed to end a costly modem technology patent dispute, with Qualcomm receiving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525962/qualcomm-apple-settlement-4-5-billion-dollars-patent"&gt;more than $4 billion&lt;/a&gt; as part of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60SHji"&gt;TSMC is the manufacturer of all iPhone A-series processors and M1 systems-on-chip for Mac computers. According to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, there are hundreds of TSMC engineers based in Cupertino to work with Apple’s chip development team. 2022 iPhone SoCs will reportedly use TSMC’s 4nm process, and some iPad models are said to be adopting 3nm processors in 2023. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;says the iPhone will make the 3nm jump “as soon as” next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s digital driver’s license has been delayed to next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DRTLm7NE55KMdFk1uVaiSgpC6w=/0x259:1423x1208/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70184873/lcimg_f986f942_4ae9_4c26_ad87_37d148f9859d.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zueeoL"&gt;Apple’s digital driver’s license / ID feature won’t be coming until “early 2022,” according to an update to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 page&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/23/apple-delays-ios-15-wallet-id-feature-early-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; noticed&lt;/a&gt;. The change comes after news broke that Apple was looking for strict control over how states roll out the feature, which was previously listed as coming late this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrrzQa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Originally announced at WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Apple says that the feature will let you use its Wallet app to store your digital identification for use at airport security checkpoints. Of course, the system is dependent on your state supporting it — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652051/apple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt; that Arizona and Georgia would be the first to let citizens add their licenses to their phones (with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah following later) but didn’t specify when exactly that would be happening.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fx8kOyrZGyq6vB6feS39yxgy7Zo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23038550/Screen_Shot_2021_11_23_at_13.36.54.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211116015952/https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WayBack Machine capture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; from earlier this month shows that the “Coming early 2022” text was added recently.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lsQrOt"&gt;Earlier this month, a report showed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22781570/apple-making-states-pay-digital-id-service"&gt;how restrictive Apple’s contracts with the states&lt;/a&gt; chosen to lead the program are. &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; said, according to the contracts it viewed from Georgia, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Kentucky, that Apple has “sole discretion” concerning how the states marketed the program, how they reported on its success, and even the date that they launched the program and the devices they’re allowed to mark as compatible. States, and therefore taxpayers, are also responsible for funding the program, despite Apple choosing when it launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGkaJB"&gt;Apple does have conflicting info on its site about when digital IDs will be available — iOS 15’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/features/"&gt;“All New Features” page&lt;/a&gt; still says the feature is coming in “late 2021,” but it’s difficult to see that happening now. The holidays and the vacations that come with them are fast approaching, which traditionally makes projects difficult to complete, especially if other organizations (in this case, the state governments) are involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LDdK0"&gt;The feature wasn’t alone in missing the official iOS 15 launch — the new version of the OS was released without a good chunk of the major features that Apple had announced on stage. Many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;have been added&lt;/a&gt; through updates or have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;shown up in the beta&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming iOS 15.2, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;Universal Control is still missing&lt;/a&gt; for those wanting to control their Macs and iPads with the same mouse and keyboard. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733044/macos-universal-control-later-this-fall-monterey-feature-delay"&gt;still promising&lt;/a&gt; it’ll launch “later this fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="moMYUc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s unexciting 2021 Mac and iPhone software prove it should take a break from annual OS updates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22771079/apple-macos-monteray-ios-15-mac-iphone-software-operating-system-updates-space-out-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple sues NSO Group for attacking iPhones with Pegasus spyware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-EGsMPxGf0PtaoDncVOe6B8NEA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183455/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oJFqiU"&gt;Now Apple has followed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20938676/whatsapp-nso-group-spyware-hack-encrypted-chat-lawsuit"&gt;WhatsApp and its parent company Meta&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Facebook) in &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-sues-nso-group-to-curb-the-abuse-of-state-sponsored-spyware/"&gt;suing Pegasus spyware maker NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;. Along with promising new information about how NSO Group infected targeted iPhones via a zero-click exploit that researchers later dubbed ForcedEntry, Apple says it’s “seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ck7oLY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple: NSO agreed to the iCloud Terms of Service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rpQ3TQ"&gt;Senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761724/apple-craig-federighi-ios-sideloading-web-summit-2021-european-commission-digital-markets-act"&gt;didn’t mention sideloading this time&lt;/a&gt; but says in a statement, “State-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability. That needs to change...Apple devices are the most secure consumer hardware on the market — but private companies developing state-sponsored spyware have become even more dangerous.” Apple and WhatsApp aren’t alone in their push against NSO Group in court, as last year, tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22194930/microsoft-google-cisco-vmware-internet-association-amicus-brief-nso-group-spyware-whatsapp-facebook"&gt;including Microsoft and Google filed a brief supporting Facebook’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYaPnj"&gt;Pegasus spyware is designed to let governments remotely access a phone’s microphones, cameras, and other data on both iPhones and Androids, according to Apple’s press release. It’s also designed to be able to infect phones without requiring any action from the user and without leaving a trace, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;reports that came out earlier&lt;/a&gt; this year from a journalistic coalition called the Pegasus Project and Apple’s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zuwfvv"&gt;Apple also cites reports that the spyware has been used against journalists, activists, and politicians, despite &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;NSO’s claims&lt;/a&gt; that its governmental clients are forbidden from using the spyware against those sorts of targets. It’s understandable why Apple, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169781/apple-google-privacy-troll-billboard"&gt;“what happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone” company&lt;/a&gt;, would be upset about its devices and services being used to carry out what it calls “human rights abuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0UK4TH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The lawsuit is a “stake in the ground” for Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmGje8"&gt;Apple’s senior director of commercial litigation Heather Grenier says in a statement to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/technology/apple-nso-group-lawsuit.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the lawsuit is meant to be a “stake in the ground, to send a clear signal” that the company won’t allow its users to suffer “this type of abuse.” Part of Apple’s argument &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/Apple_v_NSO_Complaint_112321.pdf"&gt;laid out in the complaint&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) is that NSO violated Apple’s terms of service because the group created “more than one hundred” Apple IDs to help it send data to targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8cZ79H"&gt;The Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because, on information and belief, they created more than one hundred Apple IDs to carry out their attacks and also agreed to Apple’s iCloud Terms and Conditions (“iCloud Terms”), including a mandatory and enforceable forum selection and exclusive jurisdiction clause that constitutes express consent to the jurisdiction of this Court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="znIVpi"&gt;In Apple’s complaint, it breaks down how the attack worked — using the Apple IDs it created, NSO would send data to a target via iMessage (after determining that they were using an iPhone), which was maliciously crafted to turn off the iPhone’s logging. That would then let NSO secretly install the Pegasus spyware and control what was being collected on the phone. Apple says that the specific vulnerability that NSO was using was patched in iOS 14.8, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672352/apple-spyware-gateway-iphone-software-update-nso-pegasus"&gt;you can read more about here&lt;/a&gt;. The summary is that NSO was sending files that exploited a bug in how iMessage rendered GIFs and PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E62I1t"&gt;Apple says in its press release that, thanks to improvements it’s made to iOS 15 security, it “has not observed any evidence of successful remote attacks against devices running iOS 15 and later versions.” When the Pegasus Project was publishing its reports in July, Amnesty International said that the latest versions of iOS (at the time iOS 14.6) were susceptible to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K40P9H"&gt;For more information about the reporting done on Pegasus, its capabilities, and its potential targets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;see our explainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nI8lDS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NSO’s Pegasus spyware: here’s what we know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jMtOKu"&gt;In addition to its lawsuit against NSO, Apple says it’ll be supporting “organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy,” both financially and with technical resources. The company says it’ll distribute $10 million (plus any damages it wins from its lawsuit) to groups working on counter-surveillance and pledges in its press release to give free “technical, threat intelligence, and engineering assistance” to Citizen Lab, a group of researchers that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672352/apple-spyware-gateway-iphone-software-update-nso-pegasus"&gt;were involved with the Pegasus Project&lt;/a&gt; and that helped Apple discover and patch NSO’s exploits. Apple also says it’ll do the same for other organizations “where appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ozzFC"&gt;NSO was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761565/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-entity-list-us-government-human-rights"&gt;recently added to the US Entity List&lt;/a&gt;, which limits the ways American companies can sell or provide their technology to the company. According to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/11/23/1040509/france-macron-nso-in-crisis-sanctions/"&gt;a report by the MIT Technology Review&lt;/a&gt;, the sanction has been seriously detrimental both to employee morale at NSO Group, and the company’s ability to do business. The report says the company has to request permission from the US government to purchase items like laptops running Windows and iPhones, and that the government has said its default decision would be to turn down those requests.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals under $25</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/InnS7S5uPiCAjrbGIvGg1i-jofo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181956/dseifert_181011_3006_1141.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the best affordable smart speakers you can get is just $20 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ld9a3y"&gt;If our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"&gt;best early Black Friday deals under $50&lt;/a&gt; was outside your budget, don’t worry: there’s also plenty you can buy for under $25. Several retailers are now heavily discounting popular tech products in the short lead-up to Black Friday, discounting everything from Bluetooth trackers and smart speakers to the latest gaming subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Va5kw"&gt;For your convenience, we’ve curated a list of some of the best sub-$25 options below. If you’re looking for more holiday gift ideas that won’t break the bank, however, we’ve also put together separate budget-based gift guides for items under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745314/holiday-gift-guide-under-25-cheap-tech-2021-best-ideas"&gt;$25&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"&gt;$50&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UG2Xy7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The Verge’s Guide to Black Friday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pgirnc"&gt;For iPhone owners planning on traveling this holiday season, Amazon’s offering a great deal on Apple’s official AirTag Loop. Given that AirTags lack a lanyard hole of their own, you’ll need such a loop to securely attach them to luggage, keys, and other items. Unfortunately, these loops can be as expensive as the AirTags themselves. Thankfully, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirTag-Loop-Deep-Navy/dp/B0932LZM6K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is currently discounting the loop made to carry Apple’s popular Bluetooth tracker, selling it an all-time low of around $20 instead of $29. This deal is valid on the deep navy colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XnECMp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880413"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOcQkL"&gt;Like Apple’s AirTag, Samsung Galaxy SmartTag Plus locates lost items ranging from keys to pets. Even though it can work with both iOS and Android devices, we recommend it more for Samsung users as it’s designed to work best with Samsung Galaxy devices. The convenient Bluetooth tracker features an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio so you can more accurately track items and use the AR mode to see exactly where your missing tag is. To use the UWB radio, though, you’ll need a compatible UWB-equipped Galaxy phone. The tracker can also be used as a remote control for Samsung smart home stuff. It’s a great buy for those embedded within the Samsung ecosystem, especially right now, as the tracker is going for $25 instead of $40 today at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartTag-Bluetooth-Tracker-Locator/dp/B08NRNSVRK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://api.narrativ.com/api/v0/client_redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fgalaxy-a-smart-tag-1-pack-black-ei-t7300bbegus%2F%3Fnrtv_cid%3D.nrtv_plchldr.%26cid%3Dopmc-ecomm-nrtiv-mobacc-042720-142010-verge-8259575%26utm_source%3Dverge%26utm_medium%3Dnarrativ%26utm_campaign%3D8259575%26utm_content%3Dmobacc%26nrtv_as_src%3D1&amp;amp;a=1745743455626377571&amp;amp;uuid=b35751ff-a0af-4e83-9776-063d4c38d134&amp;amp;uid_bam=1750571413629784227&amp;amp;ar=1758359825979119625" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22570161/apple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PULPjx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyPzUR"&gt;For Xbox owners, we found a phenomenal deal from &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-xbox-one-digital/-/A-76626995&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11222021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22560195%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, where you can pick up a three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate pass for $25 instead of its usual $45 — which is nearly 50 percent off. This pass gives Xbox owners access to online multiplayer and exclusive deals, as well as EA Play tiles and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud. It also offers access to more than 100 Xbox titles for a flat, monthly fee, including &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;launches next month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cBwzN1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k5hzbg"&gt;It may be an older model, but the third-generation Echo Dot is still a great device that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;we once called&lt;/a&gt; the best cheap smart speaker you can buy. It’s far superior to its predecessor, with a loud and rich sound we praised. Right now, you can pick one up with a free Sengled smart bulb from Amazon for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen-Bluetooth/dp/B08YT3BWMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $35 on an otherwise $55 bundle. If you don’t want the color bulb, you can also opt for six months free of Amazon Music Unlimited instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7nnaNh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vLMzzl"&gt;For those who prefer Google smart speakers, the Google Nest Mini is currently 50 percent off at multiple retailers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called the small smart speaker a great upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini, one that sounds far better. The Nest Mini also makes it easy to add Google Assistant to your home. It lacks the Echo Dot’s 3.5mm jack that allows for a wired connection, but, unlike Amazon’s device, you can hang it on your wall without extra accessories. Right now, you can pick one up in various colors for 50 percent off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/google_nest_mini?hl=en-US"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Nest-Mini-2nd-Generation-Charcoal/741412707?athbdg=L1300&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LKg5XqS2?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fblack-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/google-nest-mini-2nd-generation/-/A-78589456?preselect=76500134#lnk=sametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which are all selling the speaker for $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="opekZV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="7cYUPB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880438"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDsK5U"&gt;Streaming sticks are also heavily discounted right now, especially over on Amazon. At the moment, Amazon is even taking 50 percent off of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XVYZ1Y5?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=124&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbea42d-e732-8263-21f&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22553294%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;older Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with the third-gen Alexa remote. Typically $50, you can pick one up right now for $25, the device’s best price to date. It may not be as capable as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; (which is currently selling for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08MQZXN1X?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=94&amp;amp;imprToken=1abea435-1abd-7fcc-e1c&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22548186%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35&lt;/a&gt; instead of $55), but it’s still plenty fast and supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10 Plus, and HDR10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Obk1C9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u5Bg1h"&gt;Those curious about Google’s Stadia game streaming service may want to check out this Stadia Premiere Edition bundle discount, which is available for more than 70 percent off. The $80 bundle comes with a white Stadia controller, as well as a 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is selling for just $22&lt;/a&gt;, which equates to around $58 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SqIGMT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880420"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="xJLatZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Stadia is celebrating its second birthday with hardware for free or cheap","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22790946/google-stadia-birthday-premiere-edition-price-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XXTH4I"&gt;The Blink Mini is a small, wired home security camera that comes with night vision and is capable of recording in 1080p while supporting two-way audio. While we weren’t blown away by the camera, we found that it still offers good video and audio quality for its price. Typically $35, you can buy the already affordable camera for $20 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Note, however, those new to Blink’s ecosystem will have to pay an additional $3 per camera each month for cloud storage. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21231112/blink-mini-smart-home-camera-security-cam-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone SE (2020), Pixel 5A, OnePlus Nord N200 5G, TCL 20S, Moto G Pure, Samsung Galaxy A52 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHxEoXqr1i6JVkup6wsoJeDPpyY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/best_phone_grid_16x9.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best budget phones of 2021: iiPhone SE (2020), Pixel 5A, OnePlus Nord N200 5G, TCL 20S, Moto G Pure, Samsung Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a 90Hz screen, or 5G support&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WJAPbS"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget this holiday season, we’ve got good news: you’re more likely to find mid-range sub-$500 phones available than many of the hottest flagships of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZY6SyC"&gt;Due to an unfortunate series of events — from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;ongoing chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, labor shortage, the pandemic, and global shipping delays — retailers are having a hard time keeping phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 or iPhone 13 Pro in stock; Samsung has been hit particularly hard with supply issues all year. Fortunately, there are many excellent alternatives that are nearly as capable and cost a lot less to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU3Cg6"&gt;Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are also finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with lower prices and more premium features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoCnCZ"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone&lt;em&gt; that &lt;/em&gt;much harder. It’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything well at this price point. So prioritize the features that matter most to you, whether it’s 5G compatibility with a particular network, high-resolution screen, low price, best camera, or longevity with software updates. It’s difficult to get straight A’s in every single one of these needs, but if you’re able to tolerate the occasional B, you’ll find a phone you’ll love. We recommend getting an unlocked phone for the best price and portability, but you might find better deals by buying through a carrier and signing up for a wireless plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Svhy7y"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s well over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people. While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;If you’re looking for the best budget Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; is our top choice. You’ll find an all-around good phone with a flagship-level camera, three years of software updates from Google, plus IP67 water resistance — all at a lower price than last year’s model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wu38Dv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556638"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2Gej3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711280"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE 2020 (2nd-generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best iPhone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QjIUAS"&gt;Apple’s iPhone SE 2020 (2nd-generation) strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9YYEN"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today, which also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High-refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, but you won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TvHua"&gt;The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is two years behind the latest and greatest and won’t win any benchmark races. (That would be the A15 chipset in the iPhone 13 lineup.) It’s still plenty performant, though, and it’s often hard to tell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="878itp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re looking for the fastest wireless connectivity, the SE is not going to provide it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x5bwzf"&gt;the difference between a two-year-old iPhone processor and a brand-new one in use. But why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in comparison to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUd3WA"&gt;Cellular connectivity is limited to LTE, which is fine for now but might be limiting in a few years when 5G networks become more widely available. If you’re looking for the fastest wireless connectivity, the SE is not going to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A’s 6.34-inch screen isn’t huge, but it’s just big enough to not look out of place next to the 6.5-inch competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B9aQm4"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7LCnMV"&gt;If you’re looking for the best sub-$500 Android phone, the Pixel 5A is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZV88A"&gt;The $449 Pixel 5A has a 6.34-inch OLED screen that’s on the smaller side for the budget class, but it’s bigger than the previous-gen 6.2-inch panel on the Pixel 4A 5G. There’s a bigger battery, too: a 4,680mAh cell that will last through a full day of heavy use and well into day two if you’re a lighter user. The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance for added peace of mind in the event of accidental spills or tumbles into water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD7mEy"&gt;That’s more or less the extent of the 5A’s improvements over its predecessor. The 5A’s dual rear-facing cameras (main and ultrawide), Snapdragon 765G processor, as well as the 6GB RAM and 128GB storage combination, were inherited from the 4A 5G and still deliver solid performance in this iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4bk7u"&gt;Software is another area where Pixel phones shine, and the 5A is no exception. It launched with Google’s own Android 11 OS and has already gotten upgraded to Android 12. The software is refreshingly free of the added clutter that other manufacturers sometimes pile onto it. The Pixel 5A is also guaranteed three years of OS upgrades and security updates, which isn’t quite as long as Apple or Samsung’s standard software support timespan but is certainly better than a lot of the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uppsrx"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity. You won’t get the super-fast mmWave flavor of 5G support, but you will be able to access the slower but more common, sub-6GHz 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L7fhLs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cubsS1"&gt;But there’s a weird question mark over whether Google will support another set of frequencies that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will start using in the near future called the C-band. The company isn’t committing to making the necessary software update to use it, despite supporting it in hardware. It’s a strange blemish on the 5A’s otherwise strong feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHUScD"&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release: it isn’t being sold through any of the major US carriers, but you can buy it from the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/pixel-5a-5g?id=CR6HaBzv0AUAEggeh2gc79AFAA%3D%3D"&gt;Google Fi&lt;/a&gt;. All in, the Pixel 5A is still the budget Android phone we’d recommend. It’s not flashy, but it’s well priced and has it where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7CPw9a"&gt;The best phone display for $500 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qpM5xB"&gt;If you’re looking for the best display for your money, the $500 Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is a great option for future-proofing your phone, albeit at the very top of this buying guide’s price range, but it’s well worth its higher price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fpya2a"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now, the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99z3je"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise, everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating are handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIU18y"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="85J3ce"&gt;&lt;q&gt;more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C4ZNpo"&gt;includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 5A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INZwJl"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by, so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nCclP5"&gt;Best 5G phone for under $300 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RmpXOg"&gt;At $299, the OnePlus N10 5G brings 5G and some upscale features to a budget phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge4QQF"&gt;While you won’t find a fantastic screen here, its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits and only supports sub-6Hz 5G networks. It launched with Android 10, and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XlPkb6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t expect to get Android 12 on this model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y4Y1Qv"&gt;OnePlus has released the update to Android 11 already. But that’s it — don’t expect to get Android 12 on this model. OnePlus is offering two years of security updates in addition to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FucmrC"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 5A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB1WYg"&gt;If you prefer Samsung phones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is also well worth your consideration for two very good reasons: it’s a bit less expensive at $279 and will be supported with security updates for the next four years. However, it lacks some of the N10’s nicer features, like a higher refresh rate screen, good cameras, and a nicer implementation of Android. The A32 5G is a better pick if you want to hang on to your phone for as many years as possible, but the N10 is a more likable device overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOtHJH"&gt;What if both the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G and the OnePlus Nord N10 5G are just beyond your budget, but you still want a 5G-ready phone in this price bracket? Luckily for you, the unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; retails for $240 (or lower from carriers) and includes some fancy features as well. You’ll be treated to a 1080p display that refreshes at 90Hz and a 5,000mAh battery, but it only includes 64GB of internal storage. Yes, it only works on T-Mobile’s sub-6GHz 5G network but will function as a 4G phone on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. For the price, it’s not a bad way to get in on all the 5G action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Oj4ljX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best 4G phone under $300&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="npapoA"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, and good battery life, all for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRkfu4"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’ vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HhlvTs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S is a solid choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rA2h68"&gt;While the 20S’ camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLPoSw"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S is a solid choice that should work on all major 4G networks in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;The best budget phone with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MC6Jne"&gt;It’s slim pickings for Android users who want a new budget phone with a stylus. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;LG exiting the smartphone market this year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;Samsung pausing (or perhaps ending) its premium Galaxy Note series&lt;/a&gt;, there’s only Motorola’s Moto G Stylus left to hold the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Y0rd"&gt;Of the Motorola budget devices we’ve tested this year, the Moto G Stylus (2021) offers the best balance of features and cost-saving measures. It’s a good phone for $280, whether you’re a stylus devotee or just stylus-curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyyTGB"&gt;It has a big 6.8-inch LCD display at 1080p resolution, good battery life with its 4,000mAh cell, and ample internal storage with 128GB of capacity. Thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 678 processor and 4GB of RAM, the G Stylus performs just fine with the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3VEksQ"&gt;occasional hiccup. The cameras, though flawed, are good enough to get by. You won’t find an amazing night mode or top-notch picture quality here, but for a sub-$300 phone, it does the job just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44WwOS"&gt;The Moto G Stylus’ stylus is built into the device like the Galaxy Note. Popping it out brings up a quick menu of shortcuts to stylus-friendly apps, like its coloring book app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5Ppnc"&gt;There’s no telling how much longer Motorola will make the Moto G Stylus, so if you want a budget phone with a built-in stylus, you should grab one while you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. TCL 20SE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The best 4G phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3LcHIR"&gt;There are not many great phones available in the sub-$200 range, but the $190 TCL 20SE is a rare gem of its class. It has a 5,000mAh battery, ample onboard storage, and a beautiful “nano-photoetched” back that makes this budget phone look more expensive than it is, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPgkC4"&gt;As the most affordable model of the TCL 20 series, the TCL 20SE has a gigantic 6.82-inch display that is quite low in resolution at 720p but delivers brighter and more vibrant colors than other phones in its class — thanks to TCL’s television screen expertise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbBgrN"&gt;The 20SE’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor is supported by 4G of RAM, where they work well enough together to make &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; mostly playable, albeit with a slight lag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7K8RPt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This budget phone looks more expensive than it is&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UeESwB"&gt;Unlike other budget phones in this space, the 20SE comes with a generous 128GB of internal storage, plus a micro SD card slot for even more capacity. In addition, its 5,000mAh battery lasted a whopping 32 hours on one charge, using only Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1o43"&gt;While the 20SE’s 48-megapixel main camera can take great snaps in natural light, it’s not really meant for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfkexN"&gt;All things considered, TCL 20SE is a smart choice for a sub-$200 4G phone, especially If you won’t be using Verizon as your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;However, if you’re on an even tighter budget and need a 4G phone that will work on all the major carriers, you should consider Motorola’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787370/moto-g-pure-review-4g-android-budget-phone"&gt;Moto G Pure&lt;/a&gt;. Retailing at $160 for the unlocked version, you may be able to find deals as low as free at some carriers — if you sign up for a plan this holiday season. While the Moto G Pure is slower and smaller than the TCL 20SE, it has a more capable 13-megapixel main camera (f/2.2 aperture) that works admirably in low-light situations. Unfortunately, the G Pure only comes with a paltry 32GB of internal storage, so you’ll need to budget for a microSD card to expand its extremely limited capacity. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch SE costs just $219 at Amazon and Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vGNEa1PrOUMerlqjGUsjdcDgiM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177423/dseifert_200930_4218_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="82lp7r"&gt;A proverbial tidal wave of deals crashed down this morning, heralding the beginning of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday week&lt;/a&gt;. As I searched for deals to include in this roundup, I kept finding one after the other that was better. If you think these are good, consider acting fast, as it’s impossible to tell if they’ll stick around all week or if they’re just a flash in the pan. The very best discount that kicked off recently is a big $60 discount on the Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2ht3XXw2g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Starlight/dp/B09G9FS5YN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Regularly selling for $279, it’s just $219 — the lowest price yet. If you want the larger 44mm-sized model, it’s $249 instead of $309. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3pUJv7ioh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can shop all of the sizes and colorways right here at Best Buy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhOMfR"&gt;We heartily recommend the SE over the Apple Watch Series 3, despite the fact that the Series 3 is seeing tremendous discounts at Walmart (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it will be just $109 starting tonight&lt;/a&gt;). The Apple Watch SE is considerably faster and more capable, with additional features and more storage to make updating its software far less of a hassle. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KQ7vWS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Updating an Apple Watch Series 3 is a nightmare in 2021 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="s3B7gE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is the latest model of Samsung’s pocket-friendly portable SSD, and it’s just $110 instead of $170. We’ve seen it reach a low of $140 before, but this is yet another unprecedented Black Friday deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2t910"&gt;When the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262517/samsung-t7-usb-c-nvme-portable-ssd-speed-t5-comparison-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T7 launched in mid-2020&lt;/a&gt;, its 500GB version sold for the same $110 price that the model with twice its internal storage capacity is selling for today. It includes a Type-A adapter in case you’re a little lacking in compatible devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aAl6cu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556309"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r91QDa"&gt;You can snag a digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; for Xbox (compatible with Xbox One, Series S, or Series X) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Effect-Legendary-Xbox-Digital/dp/B08ZFDL2RK?th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $28 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The deal has wiggled well below its original $60 price a few times before, but it hasn’t gone below about $35. This collection contains the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; trilogy and several DLC items, all looking fresh to death in 4K (that is, if your console outputs to 4K).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PGVmZx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9565277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JtAB9i"&gt;If you’re looking for more gaming deals, check out our post yesterday that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22769909/nintendo-black-friday-deals-2021-switch-ring-fit-adventure-mario-kart-console-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;includes all of Nintendo’s excellent Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, including where to get its &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; console bundle, as well as many first-party Nintendo games that are selling for just $27. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/21/22789487/oculus-quest-2-vr-headset-50-gift-card-black-friday-promo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the gift card promo for the Oculus Quest 2 is happening&lt;/a&gt;, and several retailers will toss in a $50 gift card with the purchase of a headset at regular price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FzTzhf"&gt;If you’re a high-rolling PC gamer, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-49-inch-Odyssey-FreeSync-LC49G95TSSNXZA/dp/B088HH6LW5?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 49-inch Odyssey G9 curved gaming monitor is selling for $1,000&lt;/a&gt;. Believe it or not, that is this model’s lowest price yet, dropping $400 off its usual price. This ultrawide monitor has a QLED panel with a 5120 x 1440 resolution, a 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and support for G-Sync and FreeSync Premium Pro adaptive sync. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My colleague Sean Hollister reviewed this model&lt;/a&gt;, and he was impressed with its vivid colors and 1,000 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
