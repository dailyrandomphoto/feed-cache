    <title>Google exec says Apple is ‘holding back’ customers who text</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4LltNBE5S-g1C6kXU8Tt28q8GVI=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372410/vpavic_190508_3403_0377.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ubml4b"&gt;On Saturday, Android boss Hiroshi Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876067/google-apple-ios-android-imessages-bullying-lockheimer"&gt;accused Apple of “using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products&lt;/a&gt;,” after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; revealed how US teens have turned Apple’s iMessage into a social status symbol that locks Android users out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6YMP"&gt;Now, Lockheimer is taking a slightly less abrasive stance: the Google executive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777"&gt;said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that “we’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hhiPL1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.&lt;/p&gt;— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alkhQP"&gt;“By not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663659135176705"&gt;adds Lockheimer&lt;/a&gt;, later in the Twitter thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgvZlc"&gt;That’s still a big accusation, but one that pulls the conversation back into familiar territory: will Apple &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1446193676883922953%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22715696%2Fsvp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;accept Google’s olive branch&lt;/a&gt; to make iMessage more compatible with Android, or will it continue to use lock-in to sell more iPhones? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOt9Oq"&gt;On the lock-in front, there’s little question about Apple’s motivation. Thanks to the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the world has now seen confidential emails&lt;/a&gt; between Apple executives that show  the company is intentionally withholding iMessage in favor of lock-in. “I am concerned the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043920-2013-april-federighi-and-schiller-tell-cue-not-to-bring-imessage-to-android-lockin/#document/p2"&gt;wrote Apple exec Craig Federighi in April 2013&lt;/a&gt;, adding “I think we need to get Android customers using and dependent on Apple products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWOCzA"&gt;“Joz and I think moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043935-2016-march-phil-schiller-why-imessage-lockin-is-important/#document/p1"&gt;wrote Apple’s Phil Schiller in March 2016&lt;/a&gt;, forwarding an email from Beats Music co-founder Ian Rogers about how he “missed a ton of messages from friends and family” after switching to an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCGNOG"&gt;What’s less clear is whether RCS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"&gt;the next-gen replacement for SMS that’s championed by Google&lt;/a&gt; and incorporates popular features common to iMessage, has any convincing reason for Apple to sign on. That’s likely why Google is creating a little peer pressure of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6U1Fmm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Let’s chat about RCS","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"},{"title":"The moral case for iMessage on Android","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"},{"title":"Why I turned on iMessage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nMgnBN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has asked Apple if it intends to support RCS &lt;em&gt;literally years &lt;/em&gt;with no comment&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re not holding our breath. We’ve also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"&gt;the moral case&lt;/a&gt; that a company that claims privacy is a human right has a duty to bring encrypted messaging to the world, not just its own customers, and we’ve written about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"&gt;the personal plight of dealing with Apple’s inaction&lt;/a&gt;. (And when I say “we”, I mean Dieter, because RCS is his jam, I’m writing this post because he’s on vacation, and Dieter srsly why are you reading these words, aren’t you supposed to be on a socially distanced beach somewhere?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvKptQ"&gt;But maybe now that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22828277/apple-3-trillion-market-cap-company-earnings"&gt;is basically a three-trillion dollar company&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s under loads of regulatory scrutiny, and its dirty laundry (in the form of emails) has been aired in front of the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic"&gt;its employees are speaking out&lt;/a&gt;, and pieces like the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; are coming out, and its CEO Tim Cook is likely looking for a legacy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;larger than simply scaling up the company&lt;/a&gt; to become the most valuable in the world with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871202/tim-cook-2021-pay-package-compensation-proxy"&gt;a fat pay package&lt;/a&gt; as the reward... perhaps bringing iMessage to Android or RCS to iMessage is the kind of small concession that Apple might actually make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrmWgg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 7:48PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Dieter informs me Apple did actually reply to our requests for comment on RCS. Their reply was “No comment.” I regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile appears to be blocking some iPhone users from turning on Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a679SQQpMlD7hp-oo9jH_r4cJPA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372164/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile appears to be blocking some iPhone users from enabling iCloud Private Relay, a feature that lets you hide the websites you visit from third parties, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/t-mobile-block-icloud-private-relay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The block doesn’t appear to be malicious, however — without it, some T-Mobile services couldn’t operate, &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s currently available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;via a subscription to iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TMobileHelp&lt;/a&gt; What the hey?  Why are you keeping us from using &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; ‘s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/icloud?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#icloud&lt;/a&gt; private relay? &lt;a href="https://t.co/EtdxkVSpWh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EtdxkVSpWh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Guidry (@guidryjd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480599787577696260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwCA9M"&gt;Private Relay is still in beta in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and it isn’t turned on by default. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;You have to go into your iPhone’s settings to switch it on&lt;/a&gt;, which is where some T-Mobile customers have noticed a strange message popping up. As shown in the above tweet, the user is presented with the message, “Your cellular plan doesn’t support iCloud Private Relay. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z095du"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480631410239094797?s=20"&gt;a reply to that tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the user shows what happens when you click the “Learn More” button below the initial message — there, Apple explains why T-Mobile might be blocking the feature. “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay,” it reads. “Your cellular provider may be providing network-based services, such as Parental Controls, requiring them to view the traffic on your network.” An &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;internal note shared with &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggests that’s exactly what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oYDJF"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report, &lt;/em&gt;iCloud Private Relay conflicts with a number of T-Mobile services. Notably, Private Relay conflicts with T-Mobile customers using Web Guard, and Sprint and Home Office Internet customers who enable content filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4ZROa"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/european-carriers-seek-to-block-iphone-private-relay-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iPhone users in Europe were the first to notice that access to the Private Relay feature had been blocked. T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica added their names to an open letter published in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F10%2F22877211%2Ft-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that criticizes the feature. Carriers argue that Private Relay “will impair others to innovate and compete in downstream digital markets and may negatively impact operators’ ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7LADr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to T-Mobile and Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWnp0v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th, 4:48AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with additional &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;reporting by The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is the latest popular app to bail on the Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tO0RhQCW8p8IiZWXBtxzHJEPm4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371662/DSCF7013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XGd3fO"&gt;Uber has quietly shut down its Apple Watch app, with the software now showing a message that instructs people to “please switch to the Uber mobile app.” The company is “no longer supporting the Apple Watch app,” according to the text, which ends with Uber apologizing for any inconvenience caused by the app’s discontinuation. There’s also a sad face emoji to drive that sentiment home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJRJLv"&gt;As noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/uber-apple-watch-app-discontinued/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Uber hasn’t yet removed the Apple Watch app from its &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uber-request-a-ride/id368677368"&gt;App Store listing&lt;/a&gt;, where it still gets its own tab and screenshots. Presumably, that will all be history once the company releases its next update to the iOS app. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Uber for more details, and if I had to guess, the company is likely to cite low usage as the main reason for its Apple Watch exit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HdCfqjmn-JlpSN4rJ-ePN6taq4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159195/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.42.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Uber&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uber’s Apple Watch app offered basic ride-hailing functionality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scOYWz"&gt;On the one hand, this is another example of smartwatches continuing to shed apps — even those that are massively popular and borderline essential on a phone — that aren’t core to their purpose(s) of fitness tracking, notifications, music playback, and so on. I’ve long had Uber installed on my Apple Watch, and I don’t think there was a single occasion where I hailed a ride from my wrist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys7XYG"&gt;Uber ended support for its WearOS app more than two years ago, so it’s not like Google’s platform fared much better with user engagement. Lyft has been out of this game since 2018. Perhaps it’s a case where the form factor just isn’t the right match for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48SE9i"&gt;The Apple Watch app provided barebones ride-hailing functionality, with more advanced options like splitting fares and sharing an ETA reserved for the full mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jT3X_bQX7t5a0-1eIimEZhvSoS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159213/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.47.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has previously highlighted Uber for the Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gcFfKc"&gt;But it also goes to show that, in some ways, smartwatches are only moving further away from being able to serve as a standalone smartphone fill-in — even temporarily. Maybe barely anyone took advantage of Uber on the Apple Watch, but the fact that it no longer exists on the platform at all feels notable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfDX8y"&gt;Want to leave your phone at home for the day and rely on your cellular Apple Watch? You can’t hail an Uber in that scenario anymore. And it’s a use case that Apple itself once highlighted, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIWlc8"&gt;Uber continues to offer its primary app for iPhone and a larger version for the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wrZNHQuybPnb7flbGQn29kCJWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371019/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4MqeMB"&gt;App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion since the store launched in 2008, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-services-enrich-peoples-lives-throughout-the-year/"&gt;according to a Monday press release from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-services-entertain-inform-and-connect-the-world-in-unprecedented-year/"&gt;last January&lt;/a&gt; that developers had earned more than $200 billion since the launch of the App Store, so the new figure shared Monday indicates developers earned $60 billion in 2021. The iPhone maker also said that spending on the App Store between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve in 2021 grew by a double-digit amount, though it didn’t specify exactly what that number might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yzhint"&gt;While the new numbers suggest that the App Store continues to be a big moneymaker, developer unhappiness with the store is high at the current moment. Many developers have taken issue with what they see as restrictive store policies, particularly the 30 percent cut Apple takes from many transactions. Apple is still embroiled in a legal dispute with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games over the App Store, and although Apple arguably got off well from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ruling&lt;/a&gt;, that ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;has been put on hold&lt;/a&gt;, meaning Apple won’t have to let developers point customers to alternative payment systems outside the App Store for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="758qDc"&gt;Monday’s press release also included a stat first shared &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/10/31/apple-q4-2021-financials-apple-music-paying-subs/"&gt;during its October earnings&lt;/a&gt;: there are more than 745 million paid subscriptions to services from developers and Apple. In recent years, Apple has added new premium services like News Plus, Fitness Plus, and Apple TV Plus to its roster of services offerings. The strategy seems to be paying off, given the new all-time high for services revenue reported during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;October earnings&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear how many subscriptions to Apple’s own services are counted in that 745 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAfjsi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, January 10th, 6:19PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The 745 million paid subscriptions to services includes subscriptions to both developers and Apple, not just Apple, as we originally reported. That number was also shared in its October earnings, not first on Monday as we said. We regret the errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly discontinues the Beats Pill Plus, its last battery-powered speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuIZuyAmqkYZ9OSgp0aZ8TD96Ds=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370987/beats-pill-plus-0797.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zPdmTY"&gt;Apple appears to have quietly discontinued the Beats Pill Plus, with the portable wireless speaker no longer appearing on either Apple or Beats’ websites, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/apple-discontinues-beats-pill-plus/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPABjh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467123/beats-pill-plus-speaker-apple-dre"&gt;Originally released in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the Pill Plus was the first speaker released under the Beats brand since the music company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5700530/apple-confirms-beats-acquisition"&gt;purchased by Apple for $3 billion back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. A more refined version of the original Beats Pill speaker, the Pill Plus was an Apple-ified version of the original product, with sleeker monochromatic color options and the addition of a Lightning port for charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oXUrI7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Beats’ Pill+ is its best speaker ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467123/beats-pill-plus-speaker-apple-dre"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ccL1KU"&gt;Apple and Beats would continue to go on to build out Beats’ lineup of headphones over the intervening half-decade, with products like recent Beats Fit Pro or Powerbeats earbuds, both of which feature the same H1 chips and software integration as the Apple-branded AirPods lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxY13c"&gt;But the company didn’t show the same love to the Pill line. There was no Pill Plus successor that added support for Apple’s AirPlay standard or one with integrated Siri support. In fact, Apple hasn’t released another portable speaker (under either its Apple &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; its Beats brands), despite its expansion into smart home speakers with the since-discontinued HomePod and the smaller HomePod mini — the sole standalone speaker that Apple currently sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABTA5K"&gt;In the meantime, plenty of other portable battery-powered speakers around have come out to fill the niche that Apple never really explored with its Beats-branded options. There’s the Sonos Roam, which offers both Bluetooth and works with Apple’s AirPlay 2 standard, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/30/17796756/ue-ultimate-ears-boom-3-megaboom-speakers-wireless-bluetooth-price-ifa-2018"&gt;modernized versions of the Ultimate Ears speakers&lt;/a&gt; that the Beats Pill Plus used to compete with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJMmaL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIUeqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 8 may not have a body temperature sensor after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The screen is 20 percent larger on the Apple Watch Series 7" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDkDzzOZvg3BIpaWTSWwvJu1eow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370410/vpavic_211006_4796_0039.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series 7’s big update was a larger screen, which some found disappointing.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SqtZvC"&gt;If you were hoping for more exciting updates with the Apple Watch Series 8, you might have to start tempering expectations. While it was initially thought that the next-generation watch would have a body temperature sensor, it’s looking like that may not be the case after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVGhLU"&gt;A body temperature sensor for the Series 8 has been heavily rumored for some time now. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman — who has a pretty good track record when it comes to Apple rumors — first hinted &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;a body temperature sensor was coming&lt;/a&gt; in June. That was echoed by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; in September for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201#refreshed?mod=latest_headlines"&gt;a potential fertility feature&lt;/a&gt;. Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/apple-watch-series-8-thermometer/"&gt;predicted a body temperature sensor&lt;/a&gt; that same month. All in all, there have been several solid reasons to believe this was in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ariKjy"&gt;However, in his latest &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Gurman has backtracked. When speaking about the Series 8’s potential for body temperature sensing, blood glucose monitoring, and blood pressure capabilities, Gurman wrote, “Don’t expect any of these soon, though. Body temperature was on this year’s roadmap, but chatter about it has slowed down recently. Blood pressure is at least two to three years away, while I wouldn’t be surprised if glucose monitoring doesn’t land until later in the second half of the decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLqx2T"&gt;For blood pressure and blood glucose, this makes a lot of sense. While there’s been a lot of headway in noninvasive, cuffless blood pressure monitoring in wearables, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677381/smartwatch-blood-pressure-samsung-fitbit-apple"&gt;the technology simply isn’t there yet&lt;/a&gt;. The same applies to blood glucose monitoring. Although the feature was &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rumor-has-it-the-next-samsung-apple-smartwatches-might-1846124296"&gt;rumored for the Series 7 and in Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;, it never materialized. The tech does exist in a nascent form — a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-are-the-wearables-that-stood-out-at-ces-2021-1846053707?rev=1610579714156"&gt;prototype from Japanese startup Quantum Operation&lt;/a&gt; was featured at CES 2021 — but it’s nowhere near ready for consumer-grade devices. Of the rumored features, body temperature sensors seemed most likely as they’re already available in several other consumer wearables, including those from rivals like Fitbit. In fact, body temperature sensors in wearables gained a lot of attention in 2020, when researchers used them to try to determine whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535204/apple-watch-fitbit-oura-wearables-illness-prediction"&gt;smartwatches could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/can-a-smart-watch-detect-covid-19-1833409102"&gt;detect COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QjT3c"&gt;Currently, body temperature sensors are mostly used for sleep and recovery tracking, though &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-this-fertility-apps-first-scientific-study-is-so-ex-1834849462"&gt;fertility wearables like Ava&lt;/a&gt; may also feature them. While Apple has added sleep and period tracking in the past few years, they’re on the simpler side. Adding a body temperature sensor would potentially help level up these particular features, especially if the company is planning on adding fertility-related features as reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. However, Apple is notorious for sitting on features other device makers have already implemented until it’s happy with its own version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5M4RI"&gt;“Chatter slowing down,” as Gurman puts it, doesn’t mean a body temperature feature is completely dead. However, it does bring up another point: perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect Apple to introduce a new groundbreaking, industry-leading feature every year on its smartwatch. It’s true that since the Series 3, Apple has outpaced the competition when it came to advanced smartwatch capabilities. The Series 3 introduced cellular, the Series 4 changed the design and added FDA-cleared EKGs, the Series 5 added an always-on display, and the Series 6 added a SpO2 (blood oxygen) sensor. However, the additions have been less buzz-worthy starting with the Series 6. Not only have SpO2 sensors been on smartwatches since 2017, but the Series 7’s marquee feature was also just a larger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id9Von"&gt;Right now, the Apple Watch is the &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/524806/global-smartwatch-vendor-shipments/"&gt;most popular smartwatch on the market&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple has a yearslong lead on the competition. Wear OS watches are amid a complicated transition to a new unified platform with Samsung. Fitbit and Garmin may have advanced health features and better battery, but they both lag in smart features like cellular connectivity. Samsung comes closest, but many of its health and fitness features aren’t quite as polished.  Technically speaking, there’s no &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for Apple at the moment to dramatically shake things up in the short term — especially as it’s already investing resources in more groundbreaking health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lYak6"&gt;Advanced health features, especially nascent ones like noninvasive blood pressure and blood glucose, will take a while before they’re ready for consumer use. And even when they are “ready,” they’ll probably have to go through the FDA clearance process. In the meantime, it’s more than likely that future Apple Watch updates will focus more on design, incremental hardware upgrades, and software updates that make use of existing sensors. Case in point: Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;also forecasted&lt;/a&gt; the Series 8 would see a rugged sports version and a new entry-level model. That said, perhaps we’d all settle down if Apple could finally figure out how to include multiday battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4riQuZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says Apple ‘should not benefit from bullying’ created by iMessage lock-in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/56-uL5spppOk5I9TkLl66qtqb0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70368827/akrales_181218_2952_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Messages app distinguishes between iOS users (in blue) and Android users (in green). &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yY1j6X"&gt;Google has accused Apple of benefiting from bullying as part of a deliberate strategy to make Android users into second-class citizens on the iPhone-maker’s iMessage service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvJ9pO"&gt;Apple’s messaging service includes a number of iOS-exclusive features, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17506010/apple-ios-12-imessage-how-to-make-memoji"&gt;Memoji&lt;/a&gt;, and famously turns texts from Android users green instead of the iOS-native blue. This has turned iMessage into a status symbol among US teens, creating peer pressure for young people to buy iPhones and sometimes leading to the ostracization of Android users. Showing up in a group chat as a green bubble has become, for some, a social faux pas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL5hng"&gt;A recent report in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlighted this dynamic and prompted a response from both the Android team and Google’s head of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvidSI"&gt;“iMessage should not benefit from bullying. Texting should bring us together, and the solution exists. Let’s fix this as one industry,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Android/status/1479875457667448837"&gt;tweeted the official Android account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgwqNp"&gt;Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1479865157753147395"&gt;was more strident&lt;/a&gt;: “Apple’s iMessage lock-in is a documented strategy. Using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products is disingenuous for a company that has humanity and equity as a core part of its marketing. The standards exist today to fix this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aWzMmN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple says making iMessage available on Android would “hurt us more than help us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MtlNIi"&gt;Although Apple’s iMessage strategy has long been apparent, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;internal emails sent by company executives&lt;/a&gt; that were surfaced during the recent Epic Games trial confirmed the conscious importance of this strategy. Apple did consider making iMessage available on Android to attract more users, but concluded that doing so would “hurt us more than help us” (in the words of Apple exec Phil Schiller). As another executive, Craig Federighi, put it: “iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gWXGj"&gt;Google’s intervention here is not purely altruistic, of course: the company would benefit hugely from Apple making iMessage available on Android. Google has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;recently been pushing&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone-maker to support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681573/google-rcs-chat-android-texting-carriers-imessage-encryption"&gt;next-generation texting standard RCS&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended to replace SMS and has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs"&gt;gathered support&lt;/a&gt; from major US carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBsMkZ"&gt;Google is also not well-placed to criticize other companies messaging strategies. As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; editor Ron Amadeo &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ronamadeo/status/1480025128763371523"&gt;noted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the search giant is notoriously dysfunctional when it comes to messaging, and has launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;13 separate messaging apps&lt;/a&gt; since iMessage came out in 2011 (most of which have failed).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u4_l39DGwYmgazbTsBa7JXG8W0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_211006_4796_0061.15.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 currently starts at $369 instead of $399.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch to help you achieve your New Year’s fitness goals? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. Apple’s latest wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models seems too expensive, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a decent entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and solid build quality — especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range — but it’s also not one we would recommend picking up at this point. The design is aging, the processor is slower, and its paltry 8GB of internal storage hampers some of the more recent features introduced to the Apple Watch, like the ability to store music and podcasts for offline listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSKChG"&gt;If you still want to go this route, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Gen-3-Series-3-38mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Black-Sport-Band-MTF02LL-A%2F706203065%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 in black by $50, bringing the price down to $159. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgdJbF1VDYU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same model with the space gray aluminum case and black Sport Band&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm6hYBluei" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver aluminum case with a white Sport Band&lt;/a&gt;, for $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $179 in white and at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $199 in black instead of $229. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ryWZk"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped Watch SE with a space gray aluminum case and the midnight Sport Band from &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1159614/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F645876604&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for $229&lt;/a&gt;. That’s $10 shy of the lowest price we’ve ever seen this model go for. You can also buy the same configuration in select colorways for $249 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1llTisAz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The GPS and LTE versions of this size are discounted at both retailers as well, selling for $299 instead of $329 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1AJ5SW4B" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B09G95JSRJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and Best Buy is throwing in an additional month of Apple’s $9.99-a-month fitness service, Apple Fitness Plus, with each purchase. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review Apple Fitness Plus review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebnXzp"&gt;For larger wrists, Walmart is selling the bigger, 44mm, GPS model with the silver aluminum case and blue Sport Band for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F634588522&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$269 instead of $309&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy is also selling the same configuration but in different styles for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1UifrrO3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$279&lt;/a&gt;, along with the cellular and GPS variants for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1VZLc9hy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$329 instead of $350&lt;/a&gt;. Like the smaller model, each comes four months of Apple Fitness Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. Right now, Walmart is selling the 40mm, GPS-enabled model for $349 in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestAppleWatchDeals1722&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F386345423&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer was also selling the larger, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm version with GPS in red for $299&lt;/a&gt;, but it has since sold out. Instead, you can buy it in an assortment of colorways for around $429 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155142/2092?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatch172022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-aluminum-case%2F-%2FA-81498743%3Fpreselect%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm7aAnar8H" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is throwing in an additional month of Apple Fitness Plus with each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. Right now, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model for $369 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the cellular version is selling for $459 instead of $499 in select styles at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF6QF5J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestAppleWatchDeals&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-7-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F969328673&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBoAQG"&gt;If you prefer the larger, 45mm variant with GPS, it’s currently available in select colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $399 instead of $429.

&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPbDgH"&gt;Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models. However, we are currently seeing a rare sale on the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 with the stainless steel case. Right now, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFGVDS6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;45mm version is on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $629 ($120 off), an all-time low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ARKcVr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10966602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is adding audio running workouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing three Apple Watches showing screens of the first three Time to Run workouts." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQKgZ4tiPeuNw-R8ZustJzR4JJk=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359412/Apple_fitness_plus_winter_update_TTR.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time to Run launches January 10.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1pmVP"&gt;After launching Fitness Plus in December 2020, Apple has continuously added new features, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;audio walks with celebrities&lt;/a&gt; and new workout programs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385653/apple-fitness-plus-new-workouts-pregnant-beginner-older-users-jane-fonda"&gt;for pregnant and older users&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it’s announcing a few more additions, with the standout being audio running experiences dubbed Time to Run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tfTox"&gt;According to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-fitness-plus-introduces-collections-and-time-to-run-starting-january-10/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, Time to Run can help users “become more consistent and better runners,” and each session focuses on a popular running route in a specific location. The sessions will be led by Fitness Plus trainers Emily Fayette, Jamie-Ray Hartshorne, Sam Sanchez, and Scott Carvin — they all also coach the service’s treadmill workouts. Apple will also be adding another running coach, Cory Wharton-Malcolm. Each episode will also feature playlists to match the intensity of the run and chosen location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNG6SR"&gt;Time to Run is set to debut on January 10th, with new episodes arriving every Monday. The series will launch with three episodes and locales: London, Brooklyn, and Miami Beach. Users will also be shown photos on the Apple Watch of “notable sights” along the route in each city. Apple says the episodes can be played both on outdoor and indoor runs. It’ll also be available for wheelchair users as Time to Run or Push. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPjpUE"&gt;From the description, it sounds very similar to Time to Walk, which are roughly 25–40 minutes walks narrated by a celebrity guest and their curated mini-playlist. Audio or coached runs aren’t unique to Fitness Plus — you’ll also find them in other workout apps, including Aaptiv, Runtastic, Runkeeper, and Peloton. We’ll have to check out a workout for ourselves to see how Time to Run stacks up, though if it’s anything like Time to Walk, it’ll be more about an inclusive experience than hardcore intervals or sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An iPad showing the new Collections feature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I2AO77Hqu1b3jAXDHsqyY7mvius=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23152330/Apple_fitness_plus_winter_update_collections.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collections are curated workout bundles toward a specific goal. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIeq2v"&gt;The service is also adding curated workouts and meditations called Collections. The idea is to pick out a few selections from Fitness Plus’s library of 2,000 studio workouts and guided meditation that focus on a specific plan over a period of several days or weeks. There will be six Collections at launch: 30-Day Core Challenge, Improve Your Posture with Pilates, Perfect Your Yoga Balance Poses, Run Your First 5K, Wind Down for a Better Bedtime, and Strengthen Your Back, Stretch Your Hips. This is a neat addition, as one of the more annoying things about Fitness Plus since its launch has been limited filtering options. While you can search workouts by trainer, music genre, and time, you have to read each workout description to learn more about what each session is tailored toward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="501RBN"&gt;Time to Run and Collections aren’t the only new updates, however. Time to Walk is also getting a third season, with guests like Rebel Wilson, Bernice A. King, Hasan Minhaj, Chris Meloni, Ayo Tometi, Chelsea Handler, and Sugar Ray Leonard. Apple’s Artist Spotlight series, which features entire workouts set to a single musician, will add Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira, and The Beatles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H627DY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2021 iPad Mini with 5G support is $20 off today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_PbK6QfFen4CTiTRd0NUmXJzL4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359178/vpavic_210924_4766_0022_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad mini 6 (LTE) is selling for $629.98 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IIKQDn"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a deal to drop on Apple’s latest iPad Mini, today is your lucky day. Discounts on the LTE- and 5G-ready version of the iPad Mini are rare, but Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G99C83X?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 64GB model (usually $649.99) for $629.98&lt;/a&gt;. That is a small discount, but for context, it’s actually $1 shy of its best price we’ve seen yet for this model. The tablet, which released in 2021, is equipped with Apple’s A15 Bionic processor, a 12MP rear camera, and USB-C support. It also comes with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the front-facing camera to digitally pan and zoom in during video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BUjtJj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10964801"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="cZqZCV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the new iPad Mini compares to the last-gen model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22677944/apple-ipad-mini-2019-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade-worthwhile"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xkoJUi"&gt;We’ve got another Apple deal for you, but this one may help you achieve your fitness goals, if you have some. While we’ve been seeing a lot of deals on the 41mm and 45mm GPS versions, we haven’t seen as many LTE-ready Apple Watch Series 7 sales. That has changed recently, as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFM35F9/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is offering the bigger 45mm LTE Apple Watch Series 7 selling at $509&lt;/a&gt;. That price applies to a few colorways with aluminum-clad cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XFpDz"&gt;If you want a best-ever price, check out the 45mm GPS and LTE Series 7 watches that have stainless steel cases. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFGVDS6/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Some of those are selling for $629&lt;/a&gt;, which is a whopping $120 discount from their normal $749 price. The Series 7 features an edge-to-edge display, which is larger than its predecessor, as well as IP6X dust resistance. It can track statistics like heart rate, blood oxygen, EKG, and more. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/26269955.4573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNzIyNTMzL2FwcGxlLXdhdGNoLXNlcmllcy03LXJldmlldy1zY3JlZW4td2F0Y2hvcy1mZWF0dXJlcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B0da29cbb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Z78XRP"&gt;Shifting away from great smartwatches to useful and fun smart bulbs, right now, Philips Hue is taking 20 percent off some of its most popular smart light bulbs, strips, and more during its mix-and-match sale that lasts until January 17th. To get the discount, which applies to the total purchase cost, you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmX9FIUoZ0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;choose four items from this list&lt;/a&gt;. The new price will be reflected at checkout and your order will ship for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzxZDt"&gt;As for what the promo includes, there are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmYa7ZbyWv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmYbroZ5BP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three packs&lt;/a&gt; of Philips Hue A19 E26 white and color ambiance bulbs, which typically retail for $79.99 and $134.99, respectively. If you need to stock up on several bulbs, you stand to save a lot of money today. Though, understandably, you might not be in a position to put down that much cash. So if you prefer to buy just one kit, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-compatible-Assistant/dp/B07QV9XB87/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B08D9N7RJ4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack of white and color A19 ambiance bulbs for $109.99&lt;/a&gt; (usually $134.99).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYMVOK"&gt;These smart bulbs can pair to your phone via Bluetooth or to your existing setup of Philips Hue bulbs via the Hue Bridge, which uses Zigbee. That latter connectivity allows for the likes of Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa to be able to control them. These bulbs support several color temperature options, adjustable smart timers, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nAwJSC"&gt;If one of your New Year’s resolutions is to get healthier, or practice better self-care, this deal on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose Sleepbuds II&lt;/a&gt; may help. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Sleepbuds-II-Technology-clinically/dp/B08FRR6Z1N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $249 earbuds are selling for an all-time low of $199 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmGkKbWpgY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Designed to help you sleep better, these small earbuds silence external sounds and replace them with a combination of relaxing sounds and music. Unlike its predecessor, which suffered from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899371/bose-sleepbuds-faulty-battery-issues-problem-refunds-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inconsistent battery life and abrupt shutdowns&lt;/a&gt;, these are apparently much improved per Barbara Krasnoff’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also comfortable to wear, effective at silencing a range of noises, and you can even them use to set an alarm or to be alerted to phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jtvbaP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10965214"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SfO4a7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFJKK2T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arlo’s Essential indoor camera is selling for $78.49&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon, an all-time low price on this smart home device that usually costs $100. It launched last year, and alongside two-way talk capabilities, the Arlo Essential indoor camera offers a privacy shield to cover the lens, a siren, night vision support, a 1080p sensor, and a 130-degree field of view. While we’ve yet to test it for ourselves, our smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy notes Arlo’s cameras tend to be of good quality. However, as you’ll need to pay for the monthly subscription to be able to get the most use out of it, this is more of a must-see deal for those who may already have multiple Arlo cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jO0kyz"&gt;If you’re looking for a standalone camera, there are better, more affordable options on the market. The Blink Mini is one example, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $34.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9pF95d"&gt;Here are some other great deals going on:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="U1gbcp"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22859098/garmin-venu-2-plus-vivomove-sport-smartwatches" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced Garmin Venu 2 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524882/garmin-venu-2-fitness-watch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Venu 2&lt;/a&gt; is a great pick that boasts an array of sensors, ranging from a barometric altimeter for elevation to a thermometer, although it lacks a mic or speaker (both are found in the Venu 2 Plus). If those omissions don’t bother you, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smaller-Sized-Smartwatch-Monitoring-010-02429-02/dp/B0911XHHCN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the Venu 2 for $349.99 instead of $399.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="52vf6c"&gt;Find your lost items quickly with the Tile Pro Bluetooth Tracker, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2WLRWX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is currently selling for $29.99&lt;/a&gt; — one of its best prices yet, down from $35. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="igxs8I"&gt;If you’re shopping for a budget-friendly streaming stick, Woot is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289197/amazon-fire-tv-stick-2020-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire TV stick&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDeals162022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Ffire-tv-stick-with-alexa-voice-remote-2020-release-8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$19.99 (usually $39.99) until January 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. The device works with older TVs, and you can search for shows and movies to watch using vocal commands with Alexa’s Voice Remote, which is included in the price.&lt;/li&gt;
