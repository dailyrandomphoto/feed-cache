    <title>Using Apple Pay and Touch ID on an external Magic Keyboard can get complicated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nVWK2Xsofm63cVZz5P5ibWwItNE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129372/akrales_20210515_4583_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mropuN"&gt;Publications like &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/11/apple-pay-doesnt-work-on-your-magic-keyboard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported some odd behavior when trying to use Apple’s Magic Keyboard with Touch ID to authenticate for Apple Pay — specifically, that it won’t work if you’re trying to do it with a MacBook that has its display closed, as it would be while running it in “clamshell mode” hooked up to an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECgIvc"&gt;Obviously, when the MacBook’s lid is closed, you can’t use the built-in Touch ID sensor, so it’s easy to see how this limitation was put in place. But in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Apple sells an external keyboard with the sensor&lt;/a&gt; (starting at &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK293LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english"&gt;an eye-watering $150&lt;/a&gt;), it’s an awkward limitation. That’s especially true given that the keyboard’s Touch ID functionality only works with Apple Silicon-powered Macs and comes with all but the base-level iMac. That means that most of the people buying it will likely be laptop users looking for a way to type while their laptop is docked (maybe even with the screen closed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rYYp5l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If it’s safe enough for an M1 Mac Mini, it’s safe enough for a docked MacBook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fiiiec"&gt;Hopefully Apple will let its users make payments with their external keyboard soon, no matter what the state of their laptop’s lid is. It’s understandable that Apple wants to make sure that payment authentication is a secure process — &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;’s article&lt;/a&gt; mentions a load of other security settings that can affect being able to use Touch ID with Apple Pay — but if it’s safe enough to use with the M1 Mac Mini, it should be safe enough to use with a docked laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6CIcJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated November 11th, 4:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that this behavior appears to be intentional, rather than a bug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS beta blurs nude images for children using Messages app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ZZ1sPIkrsfwTYCTNkf1mYR8iPw=/0x1:920x614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70126082/child_safety__cemgn2jzflqq_large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promotional images of the feature released earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mnUVnE"&gt;iOS 15.2’s latest beta adds an Apple Communication Safety feature to the Messages app, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The opt-in feature is designed to protect children from inappropriate imagery by scanning incoming and outgoing pictures for “sexually explicit” material. Any images meeting this description are blurred, and the child will be warned about its contents and told it’s ok not to view it. The feature, which ties into Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201060"&gt;existing Family Sharing system&lt;/a&gt;, is also designed to offer resources to affected children for them to get help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGXNnV"&gt;The version of the feature that’s released in iOS 15.2’s latest beta has one crucial difference from what Apple originally announced in August: it won’t send notifications to parents if a child decides to view a sexually explicit image. Critics like Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic instructor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423365222841135114"&gt;Kendra Albert&lt;/a&gt; objected to this element in particular because it could out queer or transgender children to their parents. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; also notes that in its original form, the feature could have introduced safety issues when a parent is violent or abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zJmBEN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xmUOH6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-to-beta-test-imessage-feature-that-warns-kids-about-nude-imagery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that children will instead have the choice of whether to alert someone they trust about a flagged photo, and that this choice is separate from the choice of whether to unblur and view the image. Checks are carried out on-device, and do not impact end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nie4hK"&gt;The Communication Safety feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;originally announced in August&lt;/a&gt; as part of a trio of features designed to protect children from sexual abuse. However, the company said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delaying the introduction of the features the following month&lt;/a&gt; in response to objections raised by privacy advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMjijr"&gt;Communication Safety is distinct from the CSAM-detection (child sexual abuse imagery detection) feature that scans a user’s iCloud Photos and reports offending content to Apple moderators, and which generated the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;bulk of the outcry from privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an update coming to Siri search that’s designed to offer resources if a user searches for topics relating to child sexual abuse. It’s currently unclear when these two features are planned for release, and there haven’t been reports of them appearing in Apple’s public beta software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcRKjg"&gt;It’s worth noting that features added to iOS 15.2’s latest beta could still change dramatically before its official release, and it may be removed from the update entirely. Other new features that have arrived in the latest beta include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774124/ios-15-2-beta-2-airtag-tracker-scan-privacy-invasion"&gt;manual AirTag scanning feature&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;pass on your iCloud data to a loved one&lt;/a&gt; in the case of your death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt11Ji"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iCloud for Windows gets a built in password generator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTR8LPK4HIUJA_zKsdOu1Co9xHE=/1x0:1198x798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125933/2021_11_10_18_45_58_Microsoft_Store.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud for Windows’ password manager in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: iCloud for Windows&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2sLgL"&gt;A new update for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Ficloud%2F9pktq5699m62%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s iCloud Windows app&lt;/a&gt; has added a password generator, as well as support for Apple’s ProRaw and ProRes photo and video formats to the cloud storage utility. The update, which was first &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/10/icloud-windows-13/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also adds the ability for participants of a shared iCloud Drive file or folder to add or remove other users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fF7JP0"&gt;The addition of a password generator makes Apple’s iCloud keychain a much more viable cross-platform password manager. It follows an update in August which &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3629310/apple-brings-icloud-passwords-to-windows-microsofts-edge.html"&gt;allowed Windows users to access&lt;/a&gt; (but not generate) passwords from their iCloud account. Together with the &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3605098/icloud-passwords-are-coming-to-chrome-for-windows.html"&gt;Chrome iCloud extension&lt;/a&gt; Apple released at the beginning of the year, Windows iCloud users now have access to basic password management features when they’re away from their Apple device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WzA8Mz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plus new options to remove other users from shared files&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QpS9fs"&gt;Given the option, I’d personally still recommend that anyone looking for a password manager opt for a true platform-agnostic alternative. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;I recommend Bitwarden as the best free option&lt;/a&gt;, because as well as being available on Mac, iOS, and Windows, it’s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; available on Android, so you’re not locked in to Apple’s mobile platform if you want to switch in future. But using iCloud Keychain is better than not using a password manager at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GmrpN"&gt;Meanwhile, the addition of ProRes and ProRaw support is useful given that the latest iPhones are now capable of shooting in both formats. Making it easier to sync these with your Windows PC should be useful if you want to view them, or more likely edit them, on a Windows machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge buys Rittenhouse lawyer’s inane argument that Apple’s pinch-to-zoom manipulates footage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Trial Continues In Kenosha, WI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zDVoE_-vlqC4mlIOTgC89V94i-Q=/0x0:5043x3362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125363/1236486033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Krajacic-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vmv9F2"&gt;As Kyle Rittenhouse took the stand to answer questions about the sequence of events before he shot and killed a man in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the jury was forced to watch the video evidence play out in miniature — because Rittenhouse’s defense lawyer came up with the wild notion that Apple has “artificial intelligence” that manipulates footage when you pinch-to-zoom on an iPad, and Judge Bruce Schroeder totally bought into that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="raJUzK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The word he’s looking for is algorithms, but that’s beside the point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYw2Ho"&gt;“iPads, which are made by Apple, have artificial intelligence in them that allow things to be viewed through three-dimensions and logarithms,” the defense insisted. “It uses artificial intelligence, or their logarithms, to create what they believe is happening. So this isn’t actually enhanced video, this is Apple’s iPad programming creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltjm5U"&gt;While it’s unclear from a full video of the proceedings (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIzj48oL6T0&amp;amp;t=18145s"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) whether the judge actually prohibited the prosecution from using an iOS device or otherwise zooming into the footage, the result was the same: instead of using an iPad, the jury wound up watching the original, zoomed-out clips on a Windows machine hooked up to a large TV in the courtroom. The images didn’t fill the TV’s entire screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WuBA4y4JkmyBJzK_40Pt0j2In-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004713/image__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the first video clips Rittenhouse was questioned about, as presented to the jury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9zoKjo"&gt;Judge Schroeder argued that it was the prosecution — not the defense — that had the burden of proving that Apple &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; use artificial intelligence to manipulate footage, demanding that they provide an expert to testify, and didn’t allow the prosecution to adjourn to find that expert before bringing Rittenhouse up for cross-examination. The judge suggested that prosecutors could somehow find that expert in 20 minutes while they took a brief recess. “Maybe you can get someone to testify on this within minutes, I don’t know,” said the judge. No such expert was there by the time the trial resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dD9xmb"&gt;While the nature of reality with regards to digital images is thorny when it comes to things like color, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling"&gt;digital image scaling&lt;/a&gt; is fairly well understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GflCas"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/kyle-rittenhouse-charges.html"&gt;six criminal charges&lt;/a&gt; against Rittenhouse in connection to the shooting in Kenosha. He’s accused of killing two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3Iuii"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail’s upcoming iOS widget could actually be useful</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EY5kSu3I_3iWhioAyqtaA8cXnPs=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125299/gmail_widget.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BCy6If"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/stay-productive-these-google-features-ios/"&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s updating the Gmail iOS widget with a new one that’s actually useful, showing you the subjects and senders of the emails sitting in your inbox. The company says the new widget will be “launching in the next few weeks,” to replace the previous version that wasn’t particularly well-received. This also means that, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/10/gmail-ios-widget-meet-sheets/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, this means that Gmail’s iOS widget will have the same functionality as the current Android one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5lXgJ"&gt;When the first version of the Gmail widget launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574112/google-new-gmail-widget-ios-14-limitations"&gt;we pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that it isn’t particularly helpful. It really only provides shortcuts to different screens on the app like your inbox and the email composer. Critically, it doesn’t actually show you much information about the emails you’ve received, though it does tell you how many are sitting unread in your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14nvlngEXOqt5quLjsKEo8_jzg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004270/Old_Widget.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old widget can only take to to the app’s search, compose, and inbox screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VCvrrd"&gt;Part of the old widget’s lack of functionality was due to Apple’s limitations. You’re currently not allowed to build interactivity into your widget, and any tapping the user does has to be handled by launching the app. Those rules haven’t substantially changed since the first widget was introduced, but the new design shows that there’s still room for useful information. You may not be able to archive an email from your home screen, for example, but you’ll at least be able to get a feel for what’s waiting in your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df821sd9pAlX_97Fz1mqYrEM-wY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004197/Sheets_Keyboardshortcuts.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google also says it’s updating Google Sheets’ keyboard shortcut support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s05ZO5"&gt;Google also announced other upcoming improvements to its apps that could be useful for heavy users of its services. Meet (it’s business-focused video chat app) is getting support for iOS’s picture-in-picture feature, so you can still see your co-workers or the presentation while you switch apps to check on a file or email. Google also says it’ll expand the keyboard shortcuts available for people who use Google Sheets with an external keyboard (including Apple’s Magic Keyboard case).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will soon let you pass on your iCloud data when you die </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oBZI9ivVRiNFnV9ZrEB2Al6OUiE=/375x0:4422x2698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123890/Claim_Request___iPad.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Digital Legacy program lets users choose up to five people who can access their iCloud account when they pass away.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xZ0p1D"&gt;Apple is solving a complicated problem with its latest iOS update: right of survivorship. Until now, when a loved one or family member dies, there was no easy way to access their iCloud account and absolutely no way of unlocking their phone without knowing their passcode. According to the&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/legal/internet-services/icloud/en/terms.html"&gt; iCloud terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, the deceased person’s data goes with them even with a death certificate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0yJO5"&gt;With the new Digital Legacy program, first announced at &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__youtu.be_0TD96VTf0Xs-3Ft-3D3250&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=HTakECkqD13F_4No8TePr7snOg-TM_Z0bAqwspVK1Ig&amp;amp;m=fItzX2rODQv7RTBNSewxVHMkya7KOGU1oXhxAzEMZPr6hl7x3l__BXbSpMvo-Oet&amp;amp;s=C1TZjvKT6GLXL0Ujl0iCXyP3v_KcOvP9Mlxi4sdZ8NY&amp;amp;e="&gt;WWDC earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; and arriving in iOS 15.2, you can designate up to five people as Legacy Contacts. These individuals can then access your data and personal information stored in iCloud when you die, such as photos, documents, and even purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTcY2F"&gt;To activate Digital Legacy, Apple still requires proof of death and an access key. Still, it’s a much more simplified process than before, which could require a court order confirming a right to inheritance, and even then, there was no guarantee you would get access to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsBjJm"&gt;This has been a complicated situation for Apple, which has long touted its core principles of protecting users’ privacy. &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/01/technology/leonardo-fabbretti-apple/index.html"&gt;Grieving parents&lt;/a&gt; and spouses railing against the company for not giving them access to their spouses’ photos isn’t a good look. But neither is doling out people’s data willy-nilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OicCfd"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3036546"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/991335594313139"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have systems in place for designating account access to other people, and it’s good to see Apple catching up here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/940cfO0OkQ_5sDIpdxvW-ApWX20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003129/Legacy_Contact_Setup___iPhone.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set up your Legacy Contacts in Settings on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="cGLS0b"&gt;How to set up a Legacy Contact &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="4J6udT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(note you need to be running iOS 15.2 to access this feature)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QNxQyr"&gt;On an iOS device, go to Settings &amp;gt; [your name] &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mLmW5J"&gt;On a Mac, go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oIRNAU"&gt;Under Legacy Contact, follow the instructions to add a Legacy Contact. If you use Family Sharing, you can choose a family member from the list; alternatively, add someone using their email or phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CD5ZzW"&gt;Notify your Legacy Contact and share an access key via Messages. If they accept, a copy of the access key is automatically stored in their Apple ID settings. If they decline, you will receive a notification. The access key is required to get into your account if you pass away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PRSBZY"&gt;While you can add a Legacy Contact who isn’t on iOS 15.2, they won’t be able to store the access key in the settings on their device, so you should provide it to them in another way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uspE8A"&gt;Legacy Contact is part of the Digital Legacy program and is available now in the public beta version of iOS 15.2 for iPhone. It will be broadly accessible when iOS 15.2 fully launches. Apple hasn’t said which version of macOS will support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltlITw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro vs. Pixel 6 Pro: what 2,000 photos tell us</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wh4LrChgh-_HYNao1Gus5lOdFho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121885/BFARSACE_FULLFRAME_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k3ztZx"&gt;When the iPhone 13 Pro launched earlier this fall, we said it had the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;“best camera” in a smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. The larger sensor behind the main wide-angle lens coupled with a wider f/1.5 aperture left us saying, “Whoa, look at this photo,” more often than we were used to. But a few weeks later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, with its 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images, was finally released, proving a worthy competitor for the iPhone 13 Pro’s 12-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-51a5mInUeU_ZboyZk_s8FIAOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863264/akrales_210917_4760_0441.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4yJQvkwWefcAyltTUEaEUkUjOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957778/akrales_211020_4802_0710.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro has a massive 6.7-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ty7jhO"&gt;So this year, in order to settle the score, I set out to take 1,000 photos on each device. I carried them everywhere, annoyed all of my friends by stopping to take photos every other minute, and was ultimately left with a vast range of situations and lighting conditions to compare the photos from these two cameras. Initially, I thought a winner would become obvious around the 200-photo mark, but I quickly realized using these devices was about far more than their end products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ydCHj"&gt;Tune in to my video above, from my camera series &lt;em&gt;Full Frame&lt;/em&gt;, to see what phone ultimately took the gold. Or visit the &lt;a href="https://adobe.ly/3mFzayJ"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro’s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://adobe.ly/3qscBzQ"&gt;Google Pixel 6 Pro’s&lt;/a&gt; 100 best photos gallery to decide a winner for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUcHeR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjmCcc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMTonE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htnkFr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAILoq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This affordable robot vacuum is even cheaper right now at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yeedi K650 robot vacuum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LImgF3OzO8n6pM-fi7Jb6HsfDlU=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121641/yeedik650skittles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t my house. Skittles operate well outside of the five-second drop rule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLAyaC"&gt;The latest (and even the not-so-new) robot vacuums from iRobot tend to cost, at least, a few hundred dollars. The sky is the limit, so to speak, when it comes to how much these can cost. But there’s a fantastic sale happening at Woot on this affordable model from a company called Yeedi. Its K650 Wi-Fi connected model with an 800-milliliter bin &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142096?sid=VergeDeals111021&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $130 right now&lt;/a&gt;. It’s currently sitting at $180 from Amazon, to give you a sense of how much it usually costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ye8Dz"&gt;This model claims to be great for pet owners, and through its companion app, you can schedule cleaning times, adjust the suction strength, and customize Yeedi’s optional magnetic boundaries, among other things. The Yeedi K650 is compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa smart assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dHMlRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10856865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QlaZd2"&gt;If you need more convincing before you buy,&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s resident smart home expert, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, said this of the K650:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cAURyh"&gt;“For a really basic just-go-do-it, budget bot, the Yeedi is a real bargain and has a huge bin, so you don’t have to empty it as often — you can also &lt;a href="https://www.yeedi.com/products/self-empty-station-yeedi-vac-series"&gt;get a self-empty station to go with it&lt;/a&gt; for another $200. It doesn’t have lidar or virtual boundaries (although there is a more expensive one that does), so you need to &lt;a href="https://www.yeedi.com/collections/accessories/k650"&gt;use magnetic strips&lt;/a&gt; if you want to stop it from going somewhere, but it’s under $200 and it really sucks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="DHZggk"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-97" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkdyLY"&gt;And now for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2P86C-1x3o"&gt;something completely different&lt;/a&gt;, the previous generation of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro that doesn’t have the M1 processor is $200 off at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553831-REG%2Fapple_mxaw2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22772076%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-ipad-pro-sennheiser-oneplus-woot-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $1,300, this sale brings the storage-packed 512GB version down to $1,100. When it originally released, we thought its performance and display were top-notch (it’s still a fantastic device). Its display has True Tone tech that adjusts its color temperature based on your ambient lighting, and it features ProMotion for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, making your content run smoother than ever. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rW0j6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="nsX2XE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cOfUIC"&gt;Another stunning deal is on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Version/dp/B08KXB3R7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 8T, which Amazon has reduced to just $450&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price ever for this model. The sticker price for this phone typically sits at around $600, but as long as you check the coupon box on the product page before you check out, you can save a grand total of $150. The 8T released about a year ago, and it’s an incremental upgrade over the OnePlus 8. But getting 256GB of storage and a 120Hz display at this price point is an excellent value, especially when you throw its Snapdragon 865 processor into the mix. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rCkP7g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9741432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk6IGU"&gt;With the impending release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711110/battlefield-2042-next-cross-gen-digital-standard-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on November 19th, it's the perfect time to gear up with this 500GB SSD from Western Digital. This PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD has been discounted to $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099GC4CRK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a complimentary code for the upcoming entry in the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield &lt;/em&gt;franchise (a $60 value). This essentially makes the SSD just $30 and is a solid value for 500GB of fast storage. If you want to double the storage, the 1TB version of the drive is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN750-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B099FNMV34?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $140&lt;/a&gt;. While this SSD is a perfectly suitable option for anyone looking to expand the storage of their desktop or gaming laptop, you’ll need to invest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;your own heatsink&lt;/a&gt; to attach to it before you install it in your PlayStation 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Noo40"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10753135"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktnQBs"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 wireless headphones are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; on the market today. These headphones normally cost $400, but the black-colored set is down to $248, while the white model is just $241 on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3MJBW8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which color you like, this is a solid deal and pretty close to the lowest price we’ve seen for these headphones at any retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoTqn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer&lt;/a&gt; was pleased with the addition of USB-C charging, as well as the incredibly comfortable design. While we admit that the original price was a bit high for what they offer, the Sennheiser Momentum headphones are a much better value at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3fehyd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPSayk"&gt;The delicious-looking Google Nest Mini is currently half price at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1505874-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00781_us_home_mini_charcoal_2nd.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22772076%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-ipad-pro-sennheiser-oneplus-woot-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJA2aQnTKB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/jWQnG5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00781us.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals111021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dorama,&lt;/a&gt; bringing the cost down to $25. This isn’t the lowest-ever price we’ve seen on this home assistant speaker, but nevertheless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; called it “a great sounding upgrade over the Home Mini.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KePwx7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tO18cA"&gt;A couple of other deals to check out...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gkTdGt"&gt;Save $100 on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ6MTC4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy RoboVac 12 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $140. Not quite the lowest price we’ve seen for this device, but it’s still a solid deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Yl4f8"&gt;Amazon is currently offering &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;four months of Kindle Unlimited for just $5&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $40 for a four-month subscription, this service grants you access to over 1 million books, thousands of audiobooks, and monthly issues of your favorite magazines. All of these features are accessible on any Kindle device or via the Kindle app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS beta lets you manually scan for sneaky AirTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlpL7ZBOcfluDDeusfpsZTsseOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121343/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTags were released earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkeFzN"&gt;Among the features added to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/09/new-features-in-ios-15-beta-2/"&gt;iOS 15.2’s second beta&lt;/a&gt; is a new option in the Find My app that lets you manually scan your surroundings for AirTags and other Find My-enabled devices that someone might be using to track you. The feature, which is &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/"&gt;detailed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is accessible via a new “Items That Can Track Me” option listed in the Find My app’s Items menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a5TOm"&gt;Hit the link, and the app will report if there are any devices nearby that aren’t owned by you and which have Apple’s tracking technology enabled. The app can then give instructions on how to disable the device. Alternatively, there’s a “Help Return Lost Items” option for items that have ended up in your vicinity accidentally rather than maliciously, which replaces the previous “Identify Found Item” text.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature is accessible from the “Items That Can Track Me” menu item.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45ZZxa"&gt;AirTags are designed to let you keep track of items like keys or a bike in case they’re lost or stolen. The new beta feature is Apple’s latest attempt to assuage critics &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review"&gt;who quickly pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that the tiny AirTags are &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;pretty good at tracking people and identified some shortcomings in the safety features Apple included at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHA2fa"&gt;In June, Apple announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516178/apple-airtags-tracking-devices-update-play-sound-privacy-android-app"&gt;initial series of measures&lt;/a&gt; to address these concerns. So rather than waiting until an AirTag had spent three whole days away from its owner before emitting a warning chime, AirTags now do so after just eight to 24 hours. Apple also announced that it is building an app for Android users to alert them to the presence of unwanted trackers and said that it would be launching later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjZ5xN"&gt;Other tweaks that have arrived with iOS 15.2’s second beta include the introduction of the Legacy Contact feature Apple announced at WWDC 2021, which lets loved ones access your account and personal information in the event of your death. The &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/"&gt;Communication Safety feature for the Messages app is also returning&lt;/a&gt;, although it now won’t notify a parent when nudity is detected in an image. It’ll just blur the image and offer safety resources. There’s also a new Hide My Email option in the mail app, and the interface of the Apple TV app has been tweaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ERa1d"&gt;As with every iOS beta, however, there’s always that chance that any one of these features may be tweaked or removed entirely before its stable release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge orders Apple to allow external payment options for App Store by December 9th, denying stay</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r9RfBg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers says Apple must comply with an order to let developers add links and buttons to external payment options, denying the company’s motion for a stay. “Apple’s motion is based on a selective reading of this Court’s findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction,” her new order reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKykar"&gt;Judge Gonzalez Rogers issued her order after a Tuesday hearing concerning the blockbuster antitrust lawsuit, which &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; publisher Epic Games filed in 2020 and which went to trial this year. During the hearing, Apple said it needed more time to rewrite its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;anti-steering policies&lt;/a&gt; — rules that bar app developers from linking to payment methods besides the iOS App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trMA1x"&gt;“This will be the first time Apple has ever allowed live links in an app for digital content. It’s going to take months to figure out the engineering, economic, business, and other issues,” said Apple attorney Mark Perry. “It is exceedingly complicated. There have to be guardrails and guidelines to protect children, to protect developers, to protect consumers, to protect Apple. And they have to be written into guidelines that can be explained and enforced and applied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lwz4gq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple does nothing unless it is forced to do it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kq9mBW"&gt;Apple has mostly praised the ruling in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; — where Judge Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;concluded that Apple hadn’t violated antitrust law&lt;/a&gt; by kicking &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store and said the company didn’t have to reinstate Epic’s developer account. But it appealed the section saying that Apple’s anti-steering policies hid relevant information from users and demanding that it remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztycTy"&gt;Perry noted that Apple already made one of the two required changes. In August, as part of a class action lawsuit settlement, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;removed a rule&lt;/a&gt; restricting how developers could contact users via email. But Apple has portrayed in-app links as a unique threat to user trust and safety, saying they could let developers scam users or send them to malicious sites. “We believe that these changes, if Apple is forced to implement them, will upset the platform. They will harm consumers. They will harm developers. That is a fact. It is going to happen,” said Perry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAZvlT"&gt;Epic framed Apple’s request as a delay tactic made without any real commitment to change. “Apple does nothing unless it is forced to do it,” said Epic attorney Gary Bornstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F4onQB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You haven’t asked for additional time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIx9yQ"&gt;Judge Gonzalez Rogers was skeptical of Apple’s request particularly because it asked for an indefinite stay of the injunction despite saying Apple just wanted more time to evaluate risks. “You haven’t asked for additional time. You’ve asked for an injunction which would effectively take years,” she said. “You asked for an across-the-board stay which could take 3, 4, 5 years.” Perry responded that Apple wanted to delay the changes until the case was resolved — saying that it was confident “we’re going to win the appeal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhANpj"&gt;That didn’t sway the judge: in her order Tuesday evening, she accused Apple of wanting “an open-ended stay with no requirement that it make any effort to comply,” and suggested that “Apple has provided no credible reason for the Court to believe that the injunction would cause the professed devastation,” with regards to the company’s argument that it would be harmed by adding external links to alternate payment systems within apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7KPck"&gt;Apple says it plans to appeal to the Ninth Circuit for a stay, since it didn’t get one from Judge Gonzalez Rogers. “Apple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved. We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,” writes an Apple spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMMHyJ"&gt;Pending a stay of some kind, the injunction is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;scheduled to take effect&lt;/a&gt; on December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
