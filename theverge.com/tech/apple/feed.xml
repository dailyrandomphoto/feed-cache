    <title>Motorcycle vibrations can degrade iPhone camera performance, Apple says</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hTpRpF"&gt;A new post on &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212803"&gt;Apple’s Support forum&lt;/a&gt; says exposing iPhones to high-amplitude vibrations, “specifically those generated by high-power motorcycle engines” could degrade the devices’ camera system. The company recommends against mounting an iPhone on a motorcycle, as the vibrations may be transmitted via the bike’s handlebars and chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sRwLO"&gt;Here’s the technical explanation from Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QRkuKC"&gt;If you accidentally move a camera when you take a picture, the resulting image can be blurry. To prevent this, some iPhone models have optical image stabilization (OIS).1 OIS lets you take sharp photos even if you accidentally move the camera. With OIS, a gyroscope senses that the camera moved. To reduce image motion, and the resulting blur, the lens moves according to the angle of the gyroscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Blnfge"&gt;Additionally, some iPhone models have closed-loop autofocus (AF).2 Closed-loop AF resists the effects of gravity and vibration to preserve sharp focus in stills, videos, and panoramas. With closed-loop AF, on-board magnetic sensors measure gravity and vibration effects and determine the lens position so that the compensating motion can be set accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLszE5"&gt;The OIS and closed-loop AF systems in iPhone are designed for durability. However, as is the case with many consumer electronics that include systems like OIS, long-term direct exposure to high-amplitude vibrations within certain frequency ranges may degrade the performance of these systems and lead to reduced image quality for photos and videos. It is recommended to avoid exposing your iPhone to extended high-amplitude vibrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CP5Qud"&gt;The iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and all iPhones since the iPhone 7 have both optical image stabilization and closed-loop autofocus (as noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/iphone-camera-vibration-damage-motorcyles/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the first outlet to spot the Apple support post). Both features are also vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208747"&gt;magnetic interference from some iPhone accessories&lt;/a&gt;, Apple warned earlier this year, but removing the accessories should take care of that issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uftGp"&gt;Additionally in the new post, Apple says if you’re planning to mount your iPhone to a scooter or a moped, it recommends using a vibration-dampening mount to lessen the risk to the phone and its camera system. And avoiding prolonged regular use of an iPhone mounted to a vehicle that produces lower-amplitude vibrations is also a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Epic both lost today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r152KsnxYCdWHHQJuuXmgDp2L4U=/169x0:1789x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842855/apple_fortnite_1984_parody.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple stands to lose billions; Epic failed to #FreeFortnite&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1FqWtG"&gt;It was May 11th, the seventh day of the Epic v. Apple trial, that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;hit upon a compromise&lt;/a&gt; neither company had asked for. She asked Epic’s economist, David Evans, if it would be sufficient to kill Apple’s anti-steering rules — the ones Apple uses to keep developers from &lt;em&gt;even telling you&lt;/em&gt; that there’s a perfectly good external website where you can purchase your subscription instead of inside the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLxfFU"&gt;On May 24th, the final day of the trial, Judge Rogers hinted she was still leaning toward that exact sort of compromise, one that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/epic-apple-judge-signals-her-ruling-won-t-make-either-side-happy?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;might not please either side&lt;/a&gt;, one that might involve Apple’s anti-steering rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SA3Xn7"&gt;That’s what happened today. Both sides lost. But Epic arguably lost more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Epxqqc"&gt;In a win for developers — but not Epic — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;Rogers ruled for a permanent nationwide injunction&lt;/a&gt; blocking Apple &lt;em&gt;not only&lt;/em&gt; from keeping iPhone users in the dark about alternate ways they can pay, but potentially allowing developers to actually stick their own purchase mechanisms into their own apps. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;It heavily depends on how the courts define a “button,”&lt;/a&gt; so stay tuned for a lot of friction and experimentation around that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW3CDv"&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a win for Epic for two reasons: First, because the judge explicitly decided that Epic’s injection of its own direct payment scheme into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on iOS — a move designed to provoke this entire lawsuit — was not okay. Epic breached its contract with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JXm2BZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic didn’t free Fortnite even a little bit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qrW493"&gt;Second, because even if Epic &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; want to now insert, say, a PayPal button into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, it can’t: Apple terminated Epic’s developer account when the company breached its contract, and Judge Rogers confirmed that Apple is completely within its rights to keep Epic off the App Store for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE366n"&gt;“Apple has the contractual right to terminate its DPLA with any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion,” ruled Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20O647"&gt;Epic also directly lost some $3.6 million, which it has to pay Apple. That’s because Epic made roughly $12.2 million in revenue with the direct payment mechanism it injected into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; against Apple’s rules, and Rogers decided that Apple deserves its 30 percent cut of that money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TknsXL"&gt;Indirectly, you could argue that Epic also lost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22412899/epic-apple-trial-rules-investment-app-payment"&gt;its considerable investment&lt;/a&gt; in making this lawsuit a success — not only legal fees, which it won’t recoup, but potentially hundreds of millions of dollars from people who would have been playing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on iOS if not for its removal from the App Store. In its first two years, the game made $614 million on iOS alone, according to Epic’s records — $52.7 million of that in Q4 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8cfay"&gt;After &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was removed from the App Store, it’s possible people who’d already installed the game kept on making purchases, but it’s unlikely they did it at scale: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;players on Apple hardware lost cross-play, access to new events and new things to buy in August 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402547/fortnite-epic-games-apple-ios-macos-two-different-games"&gt;when the game effectively split in two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjvWco"&gt;And all Epic has to show for that money is… well, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436444335751393283"&gt;the biggest change in App Store history&lt;/a&gt;, as Mark Gurman points out. (Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;our just-published history of the App Store’s major policy changes&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see for yourself.) It’s just that, as of right now, Epic can’t take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuTgGp"&gt;But those millions or even hundreds of millions pale in comparison to the billions Apple stands to lose if that App Store change is thoroughly adopted and legally enforced. Apple makes roughly $19 billion a year from apps, $6.3 billion of that in the US where the ruling has legal weight, and it wouldn’t take more than the loss of a few whales for Apple to notice a dent in that revenue, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;my colleague Chaim Gartenberg argues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BDD4YN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Epic v. Apple ruling could put a serious dent in Apple’s $19 billion App Store business","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"},{"title":"The Apple App Store: a brief history of major policy changes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"},{"title":"The future of the App Store depends on the difference between a ‘button’ and an ‘external link’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VSQAKp"&gt;Epic isn’t even bothering to spin today’s ruling as a win, and I think that makes some sense: publicly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368065/epic-fortnite-players-apple-block-updates-next-season-warning"&gt;its goal was to #FreeFortnite&lt;/a&gt;, and it completely failed at that. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on iOS is still under Apple’s lock and key. So instead of changing its tune, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"&gt;Epic will simply appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD6W0e"&gt;Apple, however, is calling the decision a “resounding victory.” That also makes sense seeing how it downgraded Epic’s original request for the courts to call Apple an illegal monopoly under the Sherman Antitrust Act all the way to a single injunction under the California Unfair Competition Law. The courts aren’t forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores, or sideloading, or to change its 30 percent fee in any way at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFaZWh"&gt;But a true victory wouldn’t have left Apple watching billions of dollars in revenue potentially slip out the door, or losing any control at all (or, for that matter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;seeing Apple’s true nature as a cutthroat business entity&lt;/a&gt; exposed to the world). Apple prefers to make far smaller concessions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;like when it volunteered to Japanese regulators&lt;/a&gt; that it could allow a specific category of “reader” apps to bypass its store for payments — even though Apple has the first and last word about whether an app qualifies to be a “reader” app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Wx3M9h"&gt;I think Jason Schreier &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1436372920285204481"&gt;has it exactly right&lt;/a&gt;: with millions and billions of dollars out the door respectively, both companies lost this fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUb6bX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So Epic lost on just about every count &amp;amp; will have to pay millions, while Apple now has to let apps use external payment processors, potentially costing them billions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big win for everyone who was rooting for both companies to lose &lt;a href="https://t.co/7V2o9PoSRz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7V2o9PoSRz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1436372920285204481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Judge says Apple may be ‘stretching the truth’ on Mac malware concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WT78OBjVXFiPS-ksPeOd2a7T5Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842145/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rxJEyX"&gt;During the &lt;em&gt;Apple v. Epic&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple software leader Craig Federighi argued that tight control over the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"&gt;was necessary for securing the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers didn’t buy it, writing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;in her ruling&lt;/a&gt; Friday that he may have been “stretching the truth for the sake of the argument.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BLF0Y"&gt;Federighi cast heavy doubts about whether Apple would be able to secure iPhones without its App Review system acting as a gateway, by saying that the macOS security &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;was basically in a bad place&lt;/a&gt;. Judge Rodgers doesn’t think Federighi has the proof to back it up (you can read her quotes below in context on page 114): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JlACaa"&gt;While Mr. Federighi’s Mac malware opinions may appear plausible, they appear to have emerged for the first time at trial which suggests he is stretching the truth for the sake of the argument. During deposition, he testified that he did not have any data on the relative rates of malware on notarized Mac apps compared to iOS apps. At trial, he acknowledged that Apple only has malware data collection tools for Mac, not for iOS, which raises the question of how he knows the relative rates. Prior to this lawsuit, Apple has consistently represented Mac as secure and safe from malware. Thus, the Court affords Mr. Federighi’s testimony on this topic little weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uLbYm3"&gt;Woof. Basically, Judge Rodgers says that Federighi was trying to make the Mac look bad so iOS could shine, without much evidence. After discussing notarization and App Review a bit more, she concludes that Apple could implement a system similar to the Mac’s without giving up much of the security iOS already enjoys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GXEznr"&gt;Ultimately, the Court finds persuasive that app review can be relatively independent of app distribution. As Mr. Federighi confirmed at trial, once an app has been reviewed, Apple can send it back to the developer to be distributed directly or in another store. Thus, even though unrestricted app distribution likely decreases security, alternative models are readily achievable to attain the same ends even if not currently employed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TtDFd2"&gt;It’s worth keeping in mind that Judge Rogers didn’t end up forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores or side-loading, and that this opinion is only contending one of Apple’s points. But it’s sharp criticism of Apple’s more prominent defenses of its locked-down approach to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFbYaW"&gt;Epic argued at trial that Apple could achieve security and privacy on iOS without controlling the exclusive way to distribute apps. It suggested that Apple could use a system similar to the Mac — by scanning apps before they run, and checking to see if it’s the same code that Apple has notarized. While the Mac notarization process doesn’t currently include all of the checks that happen in App Review, in theory it could if Apple wanted it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIscoZ"&gt;Federighi strongly disagreed that this would be sufficient. He argued that iPhones have more sensitive data than Macs do, that the iPhone’s popularity makes it a bigger target than Macs, and that Mac users have basically just learned to be more careful when installing apps. He also argued separately that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;isn’t happy with where security is on macOS&lt;/a&gt;, and said that adopting the same security model would be a “very bad situation for [Apple’s] customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2ReD5r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Craig Federighi explains why the Mac’s security wasn’t good enough for the iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"},{"title":"Apple must allow other forms of in-app purchases, rules judge in Epic v.

The Mac’s Notarization system currently doesn’t keep away the kinds of problems that App Review does (or, at least, is supposed to), but there’s no reason why it couldn’t. Even if Apple doesn’t want to implement it onto iOS, perhaps it could consider taking her suggestions to heart if its unhappy with the state of macOS security.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Epic v. Apple ruling could put a serious dent in Apple’s $19 billion App Store business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gMr5Eooyy35VxZv0SIpZaTgBAF8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841772/VRG_TBP_Epic_VS_Apple_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdSysz"&gt;The App Store may never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luTZbh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;Today’s ruling&lt;/a&gt; from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial mandates that Apple must allow all developers the option to point directly to other payment systems, in addition to Apple’s own in-app purchasing system (IAP). It’s a decision that cuts right to the heart of the roughly $19 billion a year the App Store brings in for Apple, because at the end of the day, the App Store makes most of its money off in-app purchases inside free-to-download games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLxulz"&gt;It’s not a total sledgehammer to the heart of Apple’s walled garden; the ruling still maintains the App Store as the only place that users can go to to buy or download new apps, and doesn’t challenge Apple’s 30 percent cut of those purchases. And the ruling only technically impacts US-based companies for now, which &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-stands-to-lose-a-few-billion-dollars-annually-from-ruling?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes only makes up about $6.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; (or about a third) of Apple’s global App Store revenue, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqPIpz"&gt;But for companies that make free apps with in-app purchases, subscription apps, and virtually any kind of app or service that doesn’t require an upfront payment to purchase the app itself, it’s a whole new ball game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d5aHrr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The App Store is a &lt;em&gt;remarkably&lt;/em&gt; top-heavy enterprise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qiTqVX"&gt;An often-overlooked fact about the App Store is that it is a &lt;em&gt;remarkably&lt;/em&gt; top-heavy enterprise. It would only take a few developers to make a huge impact on Apple’s roughly $19 billion per year business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1eFkh"&gt;Reports from SensorTower &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;cited by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 claimed that more than 95 percent of the App Store’s total revenue comes from the top 2 percent of developers, with the remaining 98 percent of developers making less than $1 million per year (which, in turn, qualifies them for reduced fees through Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohFvEZ"&gt;And, as the injunction reveals, the vast majority of App Store billings come from gaming. Games account for approximately 70 percent of the entire App Store’s revenue, and 98 percent of in-app purchase revenue. The App Store is a game store, and more specifically, it’s a game store for massive, free-to-play games that make nearly all of their money from in-app items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1sKIkG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The App Store &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a game store; 98 percent of all IAP is games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ax44sL"&gt;A quick glance at lists of the top-grossing apps on the App Store seems to confirm those numbers: almost every single game on the list is a free app that relies exclusively on in-app purchases to make money (with the exception of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, which is a paid app &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aA49ork8ArCP2ttn3S3oLw_Ev9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840276/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An excerpt from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ ruling detailing App Store revenue breakdown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wbQ1Aq"&gt;It won’t take many customers changing their mind to make big waves in how much money Apple makes, either. As the ruling explains, the 70 percent of App Store revenue from games comes from just 10 percent of all App Store users; over 80 percent of customer accounts generate “virtually no revenue” at all for either Apple or developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1kKOu"&gt;That assumes, of course, that developers are willing to adopt the soon-to-be added option for alternative payment methods when the court mandated date of December 9th arrives. And that’s pending any appeals putting this ruling on hold — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"&gt;Epic has already announced its intent to appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUIo94"&gt;There are plenty of details that will need to be worked out. Will developers be able to offer a PayPal or Stripe button, or will they have to link out to external sites? Will Apple be able to require that developers charge the same price for third-party payments, or will devs offer discounted prices to account for not having to pay Apple’s cut?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ywZrny"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We will immediately start working on a build of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/heyhey?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@heyhey&lt;/a&gt; where users can sign-up and pay from the app. Proud to have played a small part in the events that lead to this. &lt;a href="https://t.co/s0ZxTaerpN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/s0ZxTaerpN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1436356844570689546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVt2AY"&gt;Some developers immediately announced plans to offer a payment alternative. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1436356844570689546"&gt;Hey&lt;/a&gt;, which had its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;controversial fight with Apple last year&lt;/a&gt; over in-app payments, said less than an hour after the news broke that it would implement a version of its app that allows users to directly pay as soon as possible. Hey presumably won’t be the only major app to make the switch, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xq6RRm"&gt;But there will likely be plenty of developers who won’t offer an alternative payment — Apple’s own payment systems do offer some benefits, as Halide developer Sebastiaan de With tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re honestly quite pleased with the smoothness of Apple’s offering for payments — from handling taxes all over the world to refunds, Apple Pay, and more — so we’re unlikely to change the way we do business at present.” Smaller developers may simply not have the resources (or the desire) to implement their own payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7t6COt"&gt;The new change may mean that more money could flow through iOS apps than ever before. In theory, there’s nothing stopping Netflix from putting a full signup queue in its app now, instead of the simple sign-in button it currently offers for new accounts — or letting Spotify offer its Premium subscriptions directly to customers without Apple taking a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ax7o1m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle link to the web to sign up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8SDeDl"&gt;The ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;builds on a smaller App Store change&lt;/a&gt; made last week. Apple had previously conceded to let “reader” apps like Spotify and Netflix link out to a payment page in a settlement with the Japan Fair Trade Commission, but that applied to apps that didn’t make Apple money anyway. Today’s court injunction, on the other hand, applies to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; apps — including the ones that contributed the most to the App Store’s bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxOsUi"&gt;Under the new rules, Apple won’t see its full cut of many big apps’ payments anymore. If developers — and customers — take up the chance to pay for their in-game items and dating app swipes in a different way, Apple may not have just lost a big chunk of control over the App Store; it might be losing a big chunk of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;its services business&lt;/a&gt; for good. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple App Store: a brief history of major policy changes </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F7PUnd0Ooh7SIgjg0DXHPjcNaEw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841512/acastro_210831_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The pace of change is quickening even as Apple tries to stop it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gH3bi2"&gt;Apple’s app store policies have caused controversy and consternation many times over the years, but few periods have been as active and strange as the last two weeks. For the first time, we are seeing Apple being forced to react directly to lawsuits and regulators with substantial policy changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ksp8v4"&gt;The biggest example has of course just happened today: a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ruling from judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case&lt;/a&gt;. Apple must now allow apps to link out to other purchasing options in addition to in-app purchases. But that follows two court case settlements and a new law in South Korea that also have implications for how Apple treats developers. The pace of change is increasing and instead of leading, Apple is reacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kc04Fq"&gt;Apple will surely appeal the Epic ruling, but even if it ultimately loses, there’s a good chance that it won’t be enough to appease the legislators and lawyers who are circling Apple’s store as the main way to rein in Apple’s power. And there’s an even better chance that the developers who must try to navigate all those rules will also continue to feel like Apple is spending more effort protecting its profits than empowering developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lAdqWf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starting in 2019, there is an increased cadence of changes in reaction to controversies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe8RoO"&gt;Here, then, is a very brief history of the major policy changes and statements Apple has made about the App Store over the years. The impetus for these different changes (or, as Apple tends to call them, “clarifications”) has varied, but the trend has remained the same. Apple has worked hard to keep the fundamental, central model of a 30 percent cut intact while softening it around the edges to appease various constituencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAGEfu"&gt;But just take a look at the timing and cadence of these changes. After a development period from 2007 to 2011 when Apple fills out the features, there’s a large gap when Apple made few notable policy changes. Then, a major shift in 2016 to address some growing discontent among developers. And then, starting in the summer of 2019, there is an ever-increasing cadence of controversies and policy tweaks to address them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WptOz"&gt;As time goes on, policy changes are coming faster and the hairs Apple is splitting are getting thinner. My instinct is to say that enough is enough: Apple should just make a couple of sweeping changes and get it all done at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEiPV0"&gt;Clearly, Apple doesn’t agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGeu0u"&gt;Instead, the company is in a defensive crouch, stepping back only when forced and as little as possible. That might be a good strategy to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1433300497813815304"&gt;make sure every regulator feels like it got its pound of flesh&lt;/a&gt; and thus minimize the change Apple will have to make, as Steven Sinofsky speculated, but it’s a terrible strategy for making developers — and customers — feel good about the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bPidhv"&gt;
&lt;p id="F0QDxT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 11th, 2007 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;At WWDC, Steve Jobs says that Apple won’t have the ability for developers to install “native” apps, but instead will need to use web apps. It was the infamous “&lt;a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2007/06/13/a-very-sweet-solution/"&gt;sweet solution&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG0Ljf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 17th, 2007 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple changes its mind as it becomes clear that the demand is there (and as the home brew app movement gains momentum). It announces it will release an &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/apple-confirms-iphone-sdk-coming-next-year/"&gt;SDK for the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUjRqw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 10th, 2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html"&gt;Apple App Store for the iPhone launches&lt;/a&gt; with 500 apps and a 30 percent cut of all sales going to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjAwSw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7th, 2008 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview with Nick Wingfield, Steve Jobs says of the App Store that “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mobile-industrys-never-seen-anything-like-this-an-interview-with-steve-jobs-at-the-app-stores-launch-1532527201?utm_source=Memberful&amp;amp;utm_campaign=5ed0c8b80c-daily_update_2018_08_23&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-5ed0c8b80c-110908273"&gt;we don’t expect this to be a big profit generator&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="a57VCB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t expect this to be a big profit generator.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MjCntE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 8th, 2009 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple announces that developers will be able to add &lt;a href="https://marco.org/2009/06/20/the-economics-of-in-app-purchase"&gt;in-app purchases &lt;/a&gt;using Apple’s payment processing (and 30 percent cut). It limits in-app purchases to paid apps, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpLdM3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 15th, 2009 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple changes its mind and allows &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/15/apple-announces-in-app-purchases-for-free-iphone-applications/"&gt;in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; to be extended to free apps. It drives a huge shift in business models for many games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh3o6S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb. 1st, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html"&gt;Apple begins rejecting apps that don’t use its in-app purchasing system&lt;/a&gt;. It rejects Sony’s e-reader app. Apps are not allowed to link out to purchase or subscription pages within their apps, even if the user completes the purchase in a separate browser window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QrEf6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb. 15th, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a big new push to bring news and magazines into Apple’s ecosystem, it &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/02/15Apple-Launches-Subscriptions-on-the-App-Store/"&gt;launches subscriptions on the App Store&lt;/a&gt; for publishers. Fees are still 30 percent, and Apple makes it easy to unsubscribe — and hard for publishers to gather data about their readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBJ7hA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 28th, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we learned in discovery for the recent &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418828/apple-app-store-commission-30-percent-phil-schiller-2011-epic-lawsuit"&gt;Apple executive suggests cutting App Store commission&lt;/a&gt; in an internal email on this date. As we all know, that didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf6GQ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jan. 15th, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5311364/apple-settles-with-ftc-over-in-app-purchases-tim-cook-says"&gt;settles a case with the FTC over in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; and offers consumers $32 million in refunds. It’s a response to a raft of apps using tricky tactics to get in-app purchases. Over time, more parental controls, restraints on those purchases, and oversight on apps are added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DL5TzJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 9th, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/19/7249917/apple-swaps-free-for-get-in-app-store"&gt;changes the button naming&lt;/a&gt; on the App Store from “free” to “get,” to better reflect that some games have in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="jVhHJs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Now we’re going to open up to all categories, and that includes games, which is a huge category.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQ5OLNmgzrmm0oFqQJh0vyzX4pY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13085425/jbareham_160607_1080_0005_final_02.0.0.1465351786.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cOkYA1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 16th, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a massive and consequential change to the app economy, Apple introduces a much-expanded model for subscriptions for apps. It was big enough that our article on the event dubbed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/8/11880730/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview"&gt;App Store 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. The changes included dropping Apple’s fee to 15 percent after the first year of subscription revenue. This is also when Apple introduced &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160618044341/https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"&gt;the concept of the “reader app”&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial category that allowed users to access subscription content purchased elsewhere (like Netflix or Kindle) but disallowed linking out to those purchase options. Finally, Apple announced it would begin introducing ads in App Store search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSfemg"&gt;The change was so big that at that year’s WWDC, Apple &lt;a href="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/App-Review-Guidelines-The-Comic-Book.pdf"&gt;commissioned a graphic novel&lt;/a&gt; where the art told one story but all the text was literally the App Store rules. In one section, we see the story of a son getting a haircut for his father’s funeral while the captions list the “acceptable” business models in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whNxT0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 1st, 2016 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 2020 House subcommittee investigation revealed that in 2016, Amazon has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;secret deal&lt;/a&gt; with Apple that grants it lower fees than were available to other developers. Earlier in 2020, Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;attempted to claim&lt;/a&gt; the deal was an “established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers.” Even if it was “established,” it certainly wasn’t widely known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvyZgJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 5th, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;During its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple quietly updates its guidelines to allow for so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17430532/apple-app-store-rules-valve-steam-link-game-streaming"&gt;remote mirroring apps like Steam Link&lt;/a&gt;. It didn’t allow for full game services on the App Store, but carved out the ability to mirror a PC on an iPhone or iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KU1JZ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 28th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A controversy grows over Apple’s crackdown on developers who use enterprise tools for managing iPhones to offer parental controls to consumers. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519888/apple-screen-time-app-tracking-parental-controls-report"&gt;Apple needed to publicly explain why it was banning those apps&lt;/a&gt;. The move was viewed as anti-competitive because Apple had its own parental controls. Apple countered that those enterprise tools could be misused by hackers in a consumer context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50sQQY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 29th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple publishes a new webpage (since changed) titled &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190529141133/https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/principles-practices/"&gt;App Store Principles and Practices&lt;/a&gt;. It was essentially a marketing page designed to explain Apple’s rules for the App Store and why it believed those guidelines protected consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Varub9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18653142/apple-mdm-parental-control-screen-time-app-store-guidelines-update"&gt;another quiet update during WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, Apple updates its guidelines to allow enterprise tools to be used for parental controls, allowing them to use mobile device manager and VPN APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxrmCf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 12th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692228/apple-banned-parental-control-ourpact-mdm-app-store-control-back"&gt;Apple begins restoring banned parental control apps&lt;/a&gt; to the App Store following the controversy earlier in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grKKJJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1st, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the date we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;officially learned about the so-called “established” program&lt;/a&gt; for video streaming providers to bypass the 30 percent fee for individual video rentals and purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="fWLDrr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There is no chance in bloody hell that we're going to pay Apple's ransom. I will burn this house down myself, before I let gangsters like that spin it for spoils. This is profoundly, perversely abusive and unfair.&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272972718384623616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oUzZY3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 22nd, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In what turned out to be a big controversy for the App Store, an email app called Hey is banned because it did not offer a way to sign up for the $99 / year service inside the app itself. At issue was that “reader” app category — only those types of apps were allowed to use that business model and Apple said email didn’t count. On this date, Hey made a minor change to its app to skirt Apple’s requirement that apps provide functionality without an outside subscription and so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;Apple approves the Hey email app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxM5cW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 6th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a new battle, streaming games platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;Stadia and Microsoft’s xCloud are officially banned from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s ruling requires every game on the services to be submitted individually — a nonstarter for those services. Ultimately both would eventually return as browser-based apps after Apple quietly added the necessary Safari support for them to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTQiDD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 13th, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicks &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; following Epic’s gambit to add its own in-app purchases to the game. It would kick off a huge battle — both in the court of public opinion and in actual court. The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case would turn out to be a major event in the App Store saga, revealing all sorts of internal emails and ultimately leading to consequential rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWPSH2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 18th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an attempt to hang on to its 30 percent cut but still grant smaller developers some concessions, Apple introduces the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;.” Developers who make less than $1 million per year were allowed to apply to join the program and have their cut reduced to 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qj6fna"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 11th, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple makes it official that streaming game services are allowed in the App Store, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if each game inside the services are submitted individually&lt;/a&gt;. It is still not enough for Stadia and xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BjuyJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 23rd, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a new 16-page report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546771/apple-side-loading-security-risk-report-regulatory-pressure"&gt;Apple lays out its arguments against allowing sideloading iPhone&lt;/a&gt; apps in a report titled “Building a Trusted Ecosystem for Millions of Apps,” claiming the practice would make its phones less secure and trustworthy for users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PpH2rR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has had to change more App Store policies between August 26th,2021 to September 10th than in any other period in its history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uw1ZMM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 26th, 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple announces another new program offering a lower rate to a subset of developers. Under the new program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642902/apple-news-partner-program-lower-commission"&gt;news publishers that participated in Apple News to a sufficient degree qualify for a 15 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; on their other apps instead of 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuZn3X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 26th, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;settles a class action lawsuit with developers&lt;/a&gt;. In the proposed settlement, the company “clarifies” that developers are allowed to email their users directly with information about how they could subscribe to services outside the App Store. It’s unclear if this is actually a change and even if it is, it’s a tiny one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsgi0n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 31st, 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;new law in South Korea requires both Google and Apple to allow for third-party payment systems&lt;/a&gt; on apps in their respective app stores. It’s too soon to see how the companies will react and what the law’s effect both inside and outside South Korea will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtYNI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 1st, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another lawsuit settlement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle have a single link out to their payment services inside their apps.&lt;/a&gt; It’s a tiny crack in the so-called “anti-steering” rules, but it’s limited to a single link and limited to the so-called “reader apps” category that Apple itself has defined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZX3O9U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 10th, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple rules that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666146/apple-epic-korea-fortnite-developer-account-rules-response"&gt;won’t allow &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to return to the App Store in South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, despite the new law there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rBnZlc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 10th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;huge ruling in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the judge says that Apple is “permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.” It is also established that Apple does not have an illegal monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYUFPs"&gt;Appeals from both Epic and Apple are expected. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s California Streaming event: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7lIjwP_ApyJCBpE3hsGPPd2zsM=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841421/Apple_California_Streaming_Event_Promo_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT on September 14th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="4jNRlj"&gt;Autumn is quickly approaching, which to Apple aficionados can mean only one thing: the next iPhone is just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTkCLy"&gt;Apple’s upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;“California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; on September 14th will likely introduce more than just the iPhone 13, however. Rumors point toward a new Apple Watch, the Series 7, as well as the next iteration of the AirPods.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nrAUh"&gt;Reports and leaks indicate the new iPhone 13 lineup will feature four models that will come in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;same sizes as last year’s models&lt;/a&gt;. The new phones will likely boast high refresh rate screens, a smaller display notch, and a faster A15 Bionic chip. On the camera front, we may see the introduction of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618070/apple-2021-iphone-13-camera-features-video-portrait-prores-ai-filters"&gt;video portrait mode and an astrophotography mode&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an improved ultrawide lens and a better optical zoom for video recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKkGRw"&gt;We also expect Apple to debut the third generation of AirPods, which may take on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;similar design&lt;/a&gt; to the AirPods Pro, with a new case and shorter stems. As for the Apple Watch 7, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;rumors indicate&lt;/a&gt; it will include a faster processor and sport its first hardware redesign in years, with flatter edges, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;new watchfaces&lt;/a&gt;, and larger screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTwsG2"&gt;New MacBooks and an updated iPad Mini could potentially show up, too. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; will likely include Apple’s new, custom-designed chips and bring back previous inputs, like the HDMI port and SD card slot. The next iPad Mini, meanwhile, will reportedly feature its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;biggest revamp in nearly a decade&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a larger display and a design that closely mirrors last year’s iPad Air. We also can’t write out the possibility of a few surprises or updates to Apple’s many services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7amfL"&gt;Regardless of what’s announced, however, we’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here as new products and services are shown.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The future of the App Store depends on the difference between a ‘button’ and an ‘external link’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vy4Q_o9osraEtBdhj7-upmYhknw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841408/acastro_210831_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MT0tTw"&gt;Today the judge in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; issued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;a lengthy ruling&lt;/a&gt; holding that Epic failed to prove that Apple has a monopoly in mobile gaming transactions. Importantly, the court &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; held that Apple’s rules preventing other payment options in the App Store are anti-competitive, and issued an injunction telling Apple to cut it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksxyl2"&gt;Specifically, the court said that “Apple is engaging in anticompetitive conduct,” and that “Apple’s anti-steering provisions hide critical information from consumers and illegally stifle consumer choice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JTP8T"&gt;To fix that, the court issued the following permanent injunction barring Apple from having rules against other payment systems. I’ve bolded the most relevant bit: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EtU3FP"&gt;Apple Inc. and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and any person in active concert or participation with them (“Apple”), are hereby &lt;strong&gt;permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from (i) including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing &lt;/strong&gt;and (ii) communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xjEJAT"&gt;This specific wording is lifted directly from &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase"&gt;Apple’s App Store rule 3.1.1&lt;/a&gt;, which says “Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase,” so it’s tempting to think that the judge just declared that rule anti-competitive and crossed it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ixKZS"&gt;But it’s a little more complicated than that — now that this text is in a judicial order, it no longer belongs to Apple or &lt;em&gt;needs to be interpreted how Apple wants&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, the court was clear that it will enforce this rule, and that if anyone thinks Apple is breaking it, it wants to know. Again, my bolding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VEvUbT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Court will retain jurisdiction over the enforcement and amendment of the injunction.&lt;/strong&gt; If any part of this Order is violated by any party named herein or any other person, plaintiff may, by motion with notice to the attorneys for defendant, apply for sanctions or other relief that may be appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Cn4DTb"&gt;So now comes the &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; complicated part. What does this injunction mean for Apple and the App Store? Let’s break this rule down piece by piece — the difference between a “button” and an “external link” is going to be remarkably important here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x51bDQ"&gt;Apple is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="1yU2zh"&gt;not allowed to prohibit developers from including in their apps and their metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XLnLTS"&gt;buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rMZ1Gz"&gt;external links, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x5STCd"&gt;other calls to action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v3503i"&gt;that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="r7UTkx"&gt;in addition to In-App Purchasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Glj7SW"&gt;We can make some versions of this sentence make sense really easily:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1kGHQd"&gt;Apple is not allowed to prohibit developers from including external links in their apps that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CK5L4c"&gt;Apple is not allowed to prohibit developers from including calls to action in app metadata [like descriptions in the App Store] that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SkVZvS"&gt;But consider the following version of this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="72EBdp"&gt;Apple is not allowed to prohibit developers from including buttons in their apps that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aHyssa"&gt;Well, shit. Here is an example of a button that takes you to a purchasing mechanism in the Amazon app:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “checkout” button in an Amazon cart that has Airpods Pro in it" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uG7zasG_It_epZG_Ls3uTmR5JgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840636/IMG_8A3B35F71848_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A button in an app that directs customers to a purchasing mechanism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BnS3U9"&gt;This is the ball game! What does it mean for a &lt;em&gt;button&lt;/em&gt; in an app to “direct a customer to purchasing mechanisms”? Is it a checkout button? Can Amazon add a cart, a checkout button, and payments to the Kindle app now? The court isn’t stupid — it specified &lt;em&gt;buttons&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;external links&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which means they are presumed to be distinct. So a button can’t just be an external link that kicks you to Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ijTaRJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple will try to say that “button” just means &lt;em&gt;what something looks like&lt;/em&gt;, while developers will say that “button” means &lt;em&gt;how something works&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJx4EX"&gt;That means that a fair reading of the plain text of this injunction suggests that buttons in iOS apps can direct users to purchasing mechanisms &lt;em&gt;in the app — &lt;/em&gt;if the button just kicks you out to the web, it would be an external link!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TA4bSG"&gt;I am confident a lot of developers are going to test this language in aggressive ways, and that Apple will find itself developing new rules to protect its lucrative in-app purchasing system from competition. And I’m confident Apple will try to say that “button” just means &lt;em&gt;what something looks like&lt;/em&gt;, while developers will say that “button” means &lt;em&gt;how something works&lt;/em&gt;. (There is a lot of irony in this for Apple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QM60xD"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3856497645&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a8Ce7v"&gt;But in the end, it won’t be up to Apple to decide what this order means — it will be up to the court. And that is a delicate position to be in, because the court explicitly thinks the anti-steering rule is very anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcgjDg"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment on the difference between buttons and external links.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Fortnite return to iOS? Probably not any time soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eCJaB_ulaSaPjWnk8uFkqhVYh_s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841144/vpavic_180607_2652_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fD3GeK"&gt;The ruling is in on the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;Epic won a major concession&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to allowing alternative in-app purchase options, but Apple won out on basically all other counts. The question now is: where does that leave &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;been out of the iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; since it first violated Apple’s rules by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;offering its own payment options&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAKAE9"&gt;For the moment, it sounds like the game isn’t coming back right away. The judge did not say that Apple would be required to restore the game, and neither Apple nor Epic have indicated that it’ll return any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B1HiVc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic wants “fair competition” before ‘Fortnite’ returns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iX1kN5"&gt;In fact, Epic seems to have indicated that it’s &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;satisfied with the ruling and won’t be restoring &lt;em&gt;Fornite &lt;/em&gt;just yet. In a tweet, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;will return “when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment.” Plus, Epic has already said it plans to appeal the ruling, which raises the question of whether these new rules will even go into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wMbaNu"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3856497645" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmTIqy"&gt;Apple has contended that Epic has been the one holding &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;back all along. The company said earlier today (in response to a new Korean law) that the company would “welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,” which means getting rid of its in-app payments system. Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666146/apple-epic-korea-fortnite-developer-account-rules-response"&gt;tried to have its app restored in Korea&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple rejected it again on the same grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhLttP"&gt;Today’s ruling requires Apple to allow apps to offer buttons and links to third-party payment options — but crucially, it’s not entirely clear whether the specific payment system Epic tried to add to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; will be allowed. If apps want to use another payment system, they can send users &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the app, and Apple can’t stop them from doing so. But there’s some ambiguity on whether a full-on in-app payment alternative has to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t8c9zS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple still has to restore Epic’s developer account&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwrxWG"&gt;It’s likely that Apple will make it difficult for outside payment systems to offer a smooth and integrated experience. It’s possible that gamers will still be required to pop out to Epic’s website every time they want to make a transaction. That’s better than nothing, but Sweeney’s tweet suggests he may not view it as “fair competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3B9MT"&gt;The flip side of this is that it’s not even up to Epic when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;returns. Even if Epic caves and makes the changes, Apple still needs to restore Epic’s developer account and approve &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;for distribution. Apple has said it’s open to this, but Apple’s still the one determining whether Epic is adhering to those rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccJ9kk"&gt;There’s also the question of when and whether these rules go into effect. The ruling doesn’t go into effect for another 90 days, and that’s assuming an appeal doesn’t result in the ruling being put on hold. So the likely result is this: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;won’t return at a minimum until Apple puts new rules into place. We don’t know when that’ll happen, and even then it’s up to both companies to agree that the game is compliant with the new rules. There’s a good chance that’ll take more than 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vimeo adds support for Apple’s iPhone 12 Dolby Vision HDR videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini has a regular wide and an ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-Gy_9aMsw9Dm47hIAqACFBvhLw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840216/vpavic_4279_20201107_0048.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4R5Lr"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro launched last year with the ability to shoot video in Dolby Vision HDR — but for the most part, there hasn’t been anywhere to actually post or share those files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14OZyd"&gt;But now, almost a year after they were first announced (and just in time for Apple’s next iPhone announcement on Tuesday), &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fblog%2Fpost%2Fdolby-vision-support-apple-devices&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F10%2F22666520%2Fvimeo-apple-iphone-12-pro-dolby-vision-hdr-videos-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple, Dolby, and Vimeo are teaming up&lt;/a&gt; to allow iPhone 12 owners to post &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F601088734&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F10%2F22666520%2Fvimeo-apple-iphone-12-pro-dolby-vision-hdr-videos-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dolby Vision HDR videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syg9w4"&gt;Starting now, you’ll be able to upload Dolby Vision videos shot with iPhone 12 devices (either directly from an iPhone or from your computer after editing in a program like Final Cut Pro) to Vimeo, where anyone will be able to stream them. Dolby Vision videos on Vimeo will have a badge highlighting that they feature HDR content, so you’ll easily be able to tell (and to show off) the improved video quality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lTDWjZh8OtaerctVvkMv9Jzzd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839932/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_11.18.27_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JemWCk"&gt;Of course, you’ll still need a Dolby Vision-compatible device to &lt;em&gt;watch&lt;/em&gt; your iPhone 12-shot videos on, which (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;as Nilay noted in his review&lt;/a&gt;) can be a tricky bit of business. Furthermore, Vimeo is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; supporting Apple devices to start: an iPhone 8 or newer or second-gen iPad Pro. Alternatively, the company says that you can use an HDR-compatible Mac (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210980"&gt;see Apple’s list here&lt;/a&gt;) or an Apple TV 4K if you’ve got a Dolby Vision TV or display to connect them to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnz5FB"&gt;On the flip side, if you have another Dolby Vision streaming device (or a Windows computer), you still won’t be able to view Dolby Vision videos on Vimeo. For now, the feature is only available on iOS, tvOS, and macOS devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oqml6E"&gt;But even if you’re still mostly stuck watching videos on Apple devices, the newly added Vimeo support means that it’ll at least be easier to share and view those Dolby Vision HDR videos, instead of requiring that you share files to a friend to view on their iPhone or iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcCxds"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple must allow other forms of in-app purchase, rules judge in Epic v. Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ywPT_LKUcPUv2PxMKUNofqbq7fs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840077/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhwS4B"&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060628-epic-apple-injunction"&gt;a permanent injunction&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case on Friday morning, putting new restrictions on Apple’s App Store rules and bringing months of bitter legal jousting to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K45KuA"&gt;Under the new order, Apple is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="o8d1Ip"&gt;permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3PKLf8"&gt;In short, iOS apps must be allowed to direct users to payment options beyond those offered by Apple. The injunction is scheduled to take effect in 90 days — on December 9th — unless it is enjoined by a higher court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JZ0NQ2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rCrbJe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060697-apple-epic-judgment"&gt;In a separate judgment&lt;/a&gt;, the court affirmed that Epic Games was in breach of its contract with Apple when it implemented the alternative payment system in the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; app. As a result, Epic must pay Apple 30 percent of all revenue collected through the system since it was implemented — a sum of more than $3.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PPUKK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060631-apple-epic-judgement"&gt;In the full ruling&lt;/a&gt;, Judge Gonzalez Rogers explained her thinking on the issue in greater detail. Notably, the judge rejected both parties’ definition of the marketplace at issue in the case. “The relevant market here is digital mobile gaming transactions, not gaming generally and not Apple’s own internal operating systems related to the App Store,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ziASfQ"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3856497645&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z37QEc"&gt;Under that market definition, “the court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws,” she continued. “Nonetheless, the trial did show that Apple is engaging in anti-competitive conduct under California’s competition laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPgBwA"&gt;Reached for comment, Apple cast the ruling as a victory for the App Store model. “Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law,” a representative said. “Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world. We remain committed to ensuring the App Store is a safe and trusted marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZYfhP"&gt;On Twitter, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney expressed disappointment in the order. “Today’s ruling isn’t a win for developers or for consumers,” Sweeney said. “Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers.” Separately, an Epic Games spokesperson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1436386058317402112"&gt;told NPR&lt;/a&gt; that the company plans to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xnw77f"&gt;The new restrictions include echoes of some provisional anti-steering restrictions already placed on Apple outside of the US. On September 1st, Apple agreed to allow outside signup links for “reader” apps like Netflix and Spotify, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;a regulatory investigation in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;a South Korean law&lt;/a&gt; opened the door to alternate payment systems, although the practical impacts of the law are still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njgk3L"&gt;Apple and Epic Games have been at odds for years over the transaction fee system in the iOS App Store, which Apple sees as a necessary operating cost but Epic sees as a monopolistic tax. The fight came to a head in August 2020 when Epic installed an alternative payment system in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to circumvent the App Store’s transaction fees. Apple responded by removing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the App Store, which sparked an immediate legal complaint from Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sjbe9m"&gt;The subsequent trial was a brutal tug-of-war over the App Store model and Apple’s efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;maintain control over software on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things, we learned about Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;strange accounting methods&lt;/a&gt; and charm offensive to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;keep major players like Netflix using in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6gxfC"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Epic v. Apple trial was bigger than Fortnite|102313" data-volume-uuid="2e5d0ec67" data-volume-id="102313" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-423" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tdb9LQ"&gt;The ruling is likely to have significant impacts outside of Apple. Google is already facing a similar lawsuit from Epic Games over its own efforts to maintain the Google Play Store as the central source of software on Android, drawing on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;elaborate deals with phone manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
