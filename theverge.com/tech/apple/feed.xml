    <title>With iCloud Plus, Apple’s privacy promise is paired with an upsell</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some privacy may be paywalled&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="DAnKrI"&gt;Apple has spent considerable time championing itself as a protector of user privacy. Its CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that privacy is “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9437717/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-car-npr-interview"&gt;a fundamental human right&lt;/a&gt;,” the company has based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446220/apple-privacy-ad-video-ad-tracking-transparency"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266276/apple-iphone-ad-privacy-facetime-bug"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420108/apple-new-over-sharing-ad-privacy-security-iphone"&gt;campaigns&lt;/a&gt; around its privacy promises, and it’s had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook"&gt;high profile battles&lt;/a&gt; with authorities to keep its users’ devices private and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub0zXv"&gt;The pitch is simple: our products protect your privacy. But this promise has shifted very subtly in the wake of this week’s iCloud Plus announcement, which for the first time bundled new security protections into a paid subscription service. The pitch is still “our products keep you safe,” but now one of those “products” is a monthly subscription that doesn’t come with the device in your box — even if those devices are getting more built-in protections as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48bdJE"&gt;iCloud has always been one of Apple’s simplest services. You get 5GB of free storage to backup &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207428"&gt;everything from images, to messages and app data&lt;/a&gt;, and you pay a monthly subscription if you want more (or just want to silence &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/icloud-storage-your-guide-to-the-other-apple-tax-1516820540"&gt;Apple’s ransom note&lt;/a&gt; when you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17168618/apple-more-free-icloud-space-200gb"&gt;inevitably run out of storage&lt;/a&gt;). Apple isn’t changing anything about the pricing or storage options as part of the shift to iCloud Plus. Prices will still range from $0.99 a month for 50GB of storage up to $9.99 for 2TB. But what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; changing is the list of features you’re getting, which is expanding by three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5aUsX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Private Relay and Hide my Email are privacy features included with iCloud Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEZYZl"&gt;The first change sits more within iCloud’s traditional cloud storage remit, and is an expansion of Apple’s existing HomeKit Secure Video offering. iCloud Plus now lets you securely stream and record from an &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/#:~:text=%20and%202tb%20with%20an%20unlimited%20number%20of%20homekit%20secure%20video%20cameras%20(%249.99%20per%20month)"&gt;unlimited number of cameras&lt;/a&gt;, up from a previous &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph7bc5df9d9/ios#:~:text=up%20to%20five%20cameras"&gt;maximum of five&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGfrOg"&gt;With the new Private Relay and Hide My Mail features, however, iCloud Plus is expanding its remit from a storage-based service into a storage and privacy service. The privacy-focused additions are minor in the grand scheme of the protections Apple offers across its ecosystem, and Apple isn’t using them as justification for increasing the cost of iCloud. But they nevertheless open the door to so-called “premium” privacy features becoming a part of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;large and growing services empire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwdyUq"&gt;The features appear as an admission from Apple about the limits of what privacy protections can do on-device. “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169781/apple-google-privacy-troll-billboard"&gt;What happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;” was how the company put its promise in a 2019 ad, but when your iPhone needs to connect to the internet to browse the web, receive email, and generally earn the “i” in “iPhone,” inevitably some of its privacy rests on the infrastructure serving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPFpAY"&gt;The most interesting of these new features is Apple’s Private Relay, which aims to shield your web traffic from prying eyes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;. It hides your data from both internet service providers as well as advertisers that might build a detailed profile on you based on your browsing history. While it sounds a bit like a VPN, Apple claims the Private Relay’s dual-hop design means even Apple itself doesn’t have a complete picture of your browsing data. Regular VPNs, meanwhile, require a level of trust that means you &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/free-vpn-bad-for-privacy/"&gt;need to be careful&lt;/a&gt; about which VPN you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeG-p67DnKMzS4Km-DT-vaYOwNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649047/icloud_private_relay_diagram.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJD1oh"&gt;As Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering explains, VPNs can protect your data from outsiders, but they “involve putting a lot of trust in a single centralized entity: the VPN provider. And that’s a lot of responsibility for that intermediary, and involves the user making a really difficult trust decision about exposing all of that information to a single entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98pAcd"&gt;“We wanted to take that completely out of the equation by having a dual-hop architecture,” Federighi &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90643627/apple-privacy-wwdc-private-relay-vpn-icloud-plus-macos-monterey"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPQkKW"&gt;Here’s how it works. When using Private Relay your internet traffic is being sent via two proxy servers on its way to its destination. First, your traffic gets encrypted before it leaves your device. Then, once it hits the initial, Apple-operated server, it gets assigned an anonymous IP that hides your specific location. Next up, the second server, which is controlled by a third-party, decrypts the web address and forwards the traffic to its destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gDWvR6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple thinks today’s VPNs pose “a really difficult trust decision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTFmCY"&gt;Apple can’t see which website you’re requesting, only the IP address you’re requesting it from, and third-parties can’t see that IP address, only the website you’re requesting. (Apple says it also uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163871/cloudflare-apple-dns-protocol-online-privacy"&gt;Oblivious DNS over HTTPS.&lt;/a&gt;) That’s different from most “double VPN” and “multi-hop” VPN services you can subscribe to today, where a provider may control both servers. You could perhaps combine a VPN and a proxy server to do something similar, though. Apple says Private Relay won’t impact performance, which can be a concern with these other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzT2am"&gt;While Private Relay is theoretically more private than a regular VPN, Apple’s offering is also more limited. You can’t use it to trick websites into thinking you’re accessing them from a different location, so you’re not going to be able to use Private Relay to get around geographical limitations on content blocked by a government or a service like Netflix. And it only seems to cover web browsing data through Safari, not third-party browsers or native apps. In a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10096/"&gt;WWDC developer session&lt;/a&gt; about the feature, Apple says that Private Relay will also include DNS queries and a “small subset of traffic from apps,” specifically insecure HTTP traffic. But there was no mention of other browsers, and Apple clarified to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s only handling app traffic when your app technically happens to be loading the web inside a browser window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Dtq6yXo9hGGm4aRcOWg0hXgVLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649697/Apple_iPhone12Pro_mail_new_message_hide_my_email_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hide my Email provides a slick interface for making burner email addresses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68gn2K"&gt;In addition to Private Relay, iCloud Plus also includes Hide my Email, a feature designed to protect the privacy of your email address. Instead of needing to use your real email address for every site that requests it (increasing the risk of an important part of your login credentials becoming public, not to mention getting inundated with spam), Hide My Email lets you generate and share unique random addresses which will then forward any messages they receive back to your true email address. It’s another privacy-focused feature that sits outside of iCloud’s traditional area of focus, and could be useful even if similar options have been available for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umJUM7"&gt;Gmail, for example, lets you use a simple “+” symbol to&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6100893/how-to-make-your-email-address-as-hard-to-guess-as-your-password"&gt; add random extra characters to your email address&lt;/a&gt;. Even Apple’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650885/apple-sign-in-sso-tool-data-collection-privacy-ios-13-wwdc-2019"&gt;“Sign In with Apple” service&lt;/a&gt; pulls a similar trick, handing out random email addresses to each service you use it with. But the advantage of Apple’s new service is that it gives you an easily-accessible shortcut to generate them right in its Mail app and Safari, putting the feature front and center in a way that seems likely to boost its mainstream appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OktZBM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plenty of privacy still included with standard purchase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wE7vYu"&gt;Apple might be charging for Private Relay and Hide My Email by bundling them into iCloud subscriptions, but these iCloud Plus additions are still dwarfed by the array of privacy protections already built into Apple’s hardware and software. There’s no sign that any of these existing privacy features will be locked behind a monthly subscription fee anytime soon. Indeed, the list of built-in protections Apple offers continues to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvnlgS"&gt;This includes a new Mail Privacy Protection feature in the Mail app in iOS 15, which sends your emails through a relay service to confuse any tracking pixels that might be hiding in them (read more about tracking pixels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681508/tracking-pixel-email-spying-superhuman-web-beacon-open-tracking-read-receipts-location"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). There’s also a new App Privacy Report feature coming to iOS 15 that will show how often apps are accessing your location, camera, microphone, and other data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pHcRXNO6nTE0sIh-lo-fiCFma6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649702/Apple_iPhone12Pro_settings_privacy_app_privacy_report_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhones’ list of built-in privacy features continues to expand with iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZojtJ"&gt;But with iCloud Plus, Apple now offers two privacy protections that are distinct from those that are included for free with the purchase of a device, and the division between the two seems arbitrary to some extent. Apple justifies charging for features like Private Relay and Hide My Email because of the incremental costs of running those services, but Mail Privacy Protection also relies on a relay server, which presumably isn’t free to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t46jic"&gt;Regardless of its rationale, choosing to charge for these services means that Apple has opened the door to premium privacy features becoming part of its increasingly important services business, beyond just its hardware business. Adherence to privacy was already part of the company’s attempt to lock you into its devices; now it could become part of the attempt to lock you into its services. All the while, those &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-airpods-macbook-you-live-in-apples-world-heres-what-you-are-missing-11622817653?mod=followjoannastern"&gt;walls around Apple’s garden&lt;/a&gt; creep higher and higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIhUI7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uf8Rp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJDmFx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaoj9p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLU8A2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lagAh9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 4 has been lovingly recreated as an iPhone app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/21dUaMHpSIshryxekdjf3IuKc64=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432350/VLS_4381_1_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OldOS app on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iDMtyW"&gt;iOS 4 originally appeared nearly 10 years ago as Apple’s first mobile operating system to drop the iPhone OS naming convention. An 18-year-old developer has now lovingly recreated iOS 4 as an iPhone app, and it’s a beautiful blast from the past. If you never got the chance to use iOS 4, or you’re a fan of the iPhone 3G, OldOS almost flawlessly pulls off the experience of using an iPhone from a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aF5lrw"&gt;OldOS is “designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible,” says Zane, the developer behind the app. It’s all built using Apple’s SwiftUI, so it includes buttery smooth animations and even the old iPhone home button that vibrates with haptic feedback to make it feel like a real button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TJOAq"&gt;Apple’s built-in iOS 4 apps have also been recreated here, and it’s a real flashback to the skeuomorphic days of the iPhone whenever they launch. Photos lets you view your existing camera roll as you would have 10 years ago, while Notes transports you back to the yellow post-it notes of yesteryear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZXRH7j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today is Launch Day  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing OldOS — iOS 4 beautifully rebuilt in SwiftUI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*   Designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible.&lt;br&gt;*  Fully functional, perhaps even usable as a second OS.&lt;br&gt;*  ️ Fully open source for all to learn, modify, and build on. &lt;a href="https://t.co/K0JOE2fEKM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K0JOE2fEKM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zane (@zzanehip) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zzanehip/status/1402625414762270723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I0N5hY"&gt;The only apps that don’t work as you might expect are Messages and YouTube. Apple used to bundle YouTube directly into its operating system, and the developer behind OldOS says there are “still some major issues with YouTube” and Messages that they’re working to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuHOBz"&gt;Everything else is mostly flawless. and you can even browse the web in the old UI of Safari. The App Store also list apps that will redirect you to the modern store to download and install. There are some things that simply don’t work, including folders and no jiggling to rearrange home screen apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dw0gz"&gt;We’ve seen this type of nostalgic app appear on the iPhone before. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010953/apple-iphone-ipod-app-rewound-app-store-features-music-player-apple-music"&gt;Rewound launched in the App Store&lt;/a&gt; back in December 2019, turning an iPhone into an iPod. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024729/apple-rewound-app-iphone-ipod-click-wheel-web-android-not-available"&gt;Apple quickly pulled the app&lt;/a&gt; a few days later, citing store violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmWMWl"&gt;This latest &lt;a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/67C9v9VB"&gt;OldOS app is available on Apple’s TestFlight&lt;/a&gt; service, which is typically used to distribute beta versions of apps. That means it probably won’t last long before Apple takes exception, so grab it while you can. Zane has also published the source code for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project"&gt;entire project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re willing to compile it in Xcode then it will live forever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple may have accidentally confirmed the existence of an M1X MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQZIHF05TX0m46MhjejfbxYvORg=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69429868/retina-macbook-pro-15-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the new MacBook Pro, but it does have ports that are tipped to return!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GWELYT"&gt;Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote came and went this year without a new MacBook Pro — but it looks like that wasn’t the original intent! Intriguingly, Apple quietly included the phrases “M1X MacBook Pro” and “M1X” as tags &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TD96VTf0Xs"&gt;on its YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; of the live keynote, as spotted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maxbalzer_/status/1402626084265500679"&gt;by Max Balzer&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/09/m1x-macbook-pro-referenced-in-metadata-for-apples-wwdc-youtube-video/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cl9C5u"&gt;Not only does that sound like tacit confirmation of at least one new Arm-powered MacBook Pro, it also corroborates the rumors that it’ll include a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;, and that Apple will likely market it as an enhanced “X” variant, like it used to do with its high-end iPads, rather than going straight to M2. (Or, as some are pointing out, it could mean that someone on the social media team decided to try for an SEO boost and made it up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtQeP6"&gt;Three weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman reported&lt;/a&gt; that we’d see redesigned 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros “as early as this summer,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;ones that would&lt;/a&gt; bring back the SD card slot, HDMI port, and some form of the beloved trip-friendly MagSafe charging connector; offer twice as many high-performance CPU and GPU cores; and support up to 64GB of RAM. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;I really thought&lt;/a&gt; announcing them at WWDC would be the perfect way to distract from recent developer turmoil — you know, by announcing a MacBook Pro that’s actually for pros? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqEEJD"&gt;Perhaps that was the original idea, but we got an absolutely jam-packed keynote filled with rapid-fire software announcements instead.

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MacBook Air is the most impressive laptop I’ve used in years" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1z5Ah"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — all of which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is currently lining up deals ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place on June 21st and 22nd. However, for now, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base configuration of MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD and typically sells for $999. Right now, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$949 ($50 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The retail giant also has the 512GB configuration on sale in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5M9XBS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold for $1,149&lt;/a&gt; ($100 off), as does &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RDkNac"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The MacBook Pro comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $100 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afDps1"&gt;The upgraded, silver version of the M1-touting MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LH3F7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The space gray variant, which typically retails for $1,499 alongside the silver model, is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LM1K3/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742946215000206869#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it to $1,399. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, you can save $200 on the 13-inch model at Amazon, which is available in two configurations: a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,600 at Amazon, or you can buy one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; processor for $1,800 at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. B&amp;amp;H Photo currently has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1520434-REG%2Fapple_mvvj2ll_a_16_macbook_pro_late.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1520436-REG%2Fapple_mvvl2ll_a_16_macbook_pro_late.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; on sale for $2,199 ($200 off). There are other configurations available with more storage and quicker processors, however, not at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the Mac Mini is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We’ve seen the base model drop to as low as $600, which is its current price at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%e2%80%93%E2%80%94silver.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now (coupon applied at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="APBdOd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The creator economy is running into the Apple Tax — this startup is fighting back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The name “Fanhouse” on a tie-dye background. The H is shaped like a house." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3b6H9XwVqaUOTS2WG2nxLnA3Sqw=/0x342:2048x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69429382/EvRNO57WYAEsngW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The logo for Fanhouse, a platform that lets creators charge for access to a private social feed. | Image: Fanhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VxoadZ"&gt;Apple is clashing with the platform &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/"&gt;Fanhouse&lt;/a&gt; over whether it gets to take a cut of in-app payments to creators. The incident underscores just how little Apple understands about the creator economy, with the likely outcome being less money in creators’ pockets — and more money for one of the world’s most profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQfXy8"&gt;Founders of Fanhouse — which is basically OnlyFans without the nudity — say the platform will be kicked out of the App Store in August if it doesn’t start forking over 30 percent of the fees people pay creators when purchases are made through the iPhone app. One of Fanhouse’s creators, the streamer &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/breadwitchery/fanwall"&gt;Breadwitchery&lt;/a&gt;, says that cut would mean losing two months of rent from her earnings to date. The company doesn’t have a lot of options to push back, but it’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1402691047940100100"&gt;launching a campaign today&lt;/a&gt; to pressure Apple into easing its rules around payments to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D37kCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I use this to pay the bills for my family.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aMflPk"&gt;Fanhouse is only the latest company to clash with Apple over App Store terms that are increasingly viewed as steep and domineering. Sure, it’s a small app, and its disappearance won’t necessarily cause problems for Apple, but the situation speaks to the challenges creator-focused apps face in the App Store. As the creator economy continues to grow, the rules mean Apple will be taking more money from not just businesses, but individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVCxDY"&gt;“People are using this platform to survive, starting with me, our very first creator,” Jasmine Rice, &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/jasminericegirl/fanwall"&gt;a Fanhouse creator&lt;/a&gt; and one of the platform’s co-founders, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “I use this to pay the bills for my family. I use this to pay my mom’s medical expenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EtD4I"&gt;Fanhouse, which launched in 2020, initially slipped past the App Store bouncers and offered payments on the web without issue. Now that Apple has spotted the potential for profit, it’s given Fanhouse the same ultimatum it gives (almost) everyone else: Fanhouse either needs to pay up or get booted from the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="vVpFM6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple often takes a larger cut than the actual platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bc2LQV"&gt;The app only takes a 10 percent cut on its own, so the platform’s creators could soon be earning a whole lot less. Rice says she would be okay with handing Apple a 30 percent cut of Fanhouse’s own profits. But once that 30 percent has to cut into creators’ profits, it starts to hurt &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, not just the platform. “This money really means a second job for some people, that they have a place to live, that they can afford tuition,” Rice says. “And we tried to explain this to Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsCEqe"&gt;Fanhouse allows creators to charge a subscription for access to a private social media feed where they can post updates about their life or publish photos and videos. Creators can also earn money from tips, or they can post “locked” updates that fans need to pay to view. Each account also has a public feed that can be viewed without a subscription, which may be why the app was able to slip through the App Store unnoticed until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fojC0h"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it’s working with Fanhouse to bring the app into compliance with its rules. The company referred to &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase"&gt;its in-app purchase guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and said Fanhouse was rejected previously because of a similar violation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ue8vgJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fuckapple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fuckapple&lt;/a&gt;, a thread&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I cofounded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fanhouseapp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@fanhouseapp&lt;/a&gt; 8 months ago to empower creators to monetize their content. We pay creators 90% of earnings. Now, Apple is threatening to remove Fanhouse from the app store unless we give them 30% of creator earnings. This is theft and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;— jasmine   (@jasminericegirl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1402691047940100100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ciuIBg"&gt;Apple requires a 30 percent cut from in-app purchases of “digital” goods, such as &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins or Netflix subscriptions, though it has a number of exceptions. The figure is reduced to 15 percent for multiyear subscriptions and apps that earn under $1 million. (Fanhouse has more than $1 million in revenue, but it pays nearly all of it out to creators.) And it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;up to Apple to decide&lt;/a&gt; what qualifies as a “digital” good and what doesn’t. For instance, Apple allows Patreon to offer third-party payment solutions for creators rather than use in-app purchases, avoiding the fee. Other apps aren’t afforded that privilege. Apple and Patreon did not respond to a request for comment on the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="QkpcIF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think it speaks to a creator illiteracy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wAnZPt"&gt;Apple’s App Store rules didn’t even acknowledge creators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;until this week&lt;/a&gt;. On Monday, they were updated with a new section saying that creator-made content and experiences are allowed in apps — so long as they’re properly moderated and monetized for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOP5P3"&gt;The problem is likely to become more acute as platforms offer more ways for creators to get paid. Twitter plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447328/twitter-ticketed-spaces-monetization-stripe-approval"&gt;take a 20 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; from ticketed audio rooms later this year, from which Apple will take another 30 percent if fans pay on their iPhones. Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522706/facebook-creators-apple-google-fees-payment-interface-events"&gt;waiving its cut&lt;/a&gt; for the next year on fan subscriptions and other sources of creator revenue, but Apple will still be taking 30 percent when purchases are made through its store. Twitch already hands Apple a 30 percent cut of subscriptions and tips made through iOS, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/18/20921448/twitch-subscription-ios-app-store-price"&gt;it hikes prices there&lt;/a&gt; so that viewers have to cover the added costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZzZqi"&gt;Other creator-focused services simply aren’t offered on iOS because of Apple’s rules: Spotify doesn’t let listeners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;pay for podcast subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;, despite offering them, and OnlyFans isn’t available on the platform at all because of Apple’s ban on “overtly sexual or pornographic material.” The newsletter &lt;em&gt;Means of Creation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://every.to/means-of-creation/apple-is-holding-back-the-creator-economy"&gt;criticized these policies last month&lt;/a&gt;, writing that “Apple is now one of the main barriers to independent creators thriving on the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDAm7R"&gt;Apple is currently caught in a legal battle with Epic, the maker of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite,&lt;/em&gt; over its App Store fees. Apple is happy with its cut: it brought in $64 billion in revenue last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/apples-app-store-had-gross-sales-around-64-billion-in-2020.html"&gt;according to a CNBC analysis&lt;/a&gt;. During the trial, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that allowing other payment options “would in essence give up our total return on our IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32RExv"&gt;“I think it speaks to a creator illiteracy,” says Breadwitchery, a narrative games streamer who works part time as a community manager for Fanhouse. “Those corporations like Apple, do you not think that if you invest in creators and treat them well, they’re going to be motivated to make more content and make more money?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some of macOS Monterey’s best features aren’t coming to Intel Macs</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You won’t be able to see Apple Maps’ new globe view on an Intel-based Mac.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gynH7"&gt;Apple’s next big macOS update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, adds a bunch of good-looking new features, but some of the more interesting ones won’t be coming to Intel-based Macs, according to the fine print on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22526224%2Fmacos-monterey-best-features-macs-intel-m1-exclusive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s macOS Monterey website&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-features-for-m1-macs-only/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96ARyd"&gt;If you don’t have an M1-based Mac — and many people probably don’t, given that the first Macs with M1 chips were just released in November — here are the new features that you won’t be able to use in macOS Monterey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WAM4Ol"&gt;FaceTime’s Portrait mode, which blurs the background behind you while you’re on a video call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="peoeQY"&gt;Live Text, which lets you interact with text in photos and images (such as being able to copy and paste an address on a sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RaCNJH"&gt;Apple Maps’ new globe view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2sEh84"&gt;Apple Maps’ more detailed maps in cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and London&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mjxEfy"&gt;Neural text-to-speech voices in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and Finnish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uc1ozd"&gt;Offline, on-device dictation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YiEuuY"&gt;On-device dictation without a time limit (previously, dictation was limited to 60 seconds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="62eMVY"&gt;If you’re still using an Intel-based Mac that you’re happy with and aren’t planning to upgrade anytime soon, it might be disappointing to hear that you won’t be able to use some of the new features in macOS Monterey. These M1-exclusive updates in Monterey also suggest that Apple could make features on future macOS releases only work on computers with its own chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAtgj7"&gt;Last June, when Apple first announced the transition to its custom-designed processors, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F06%2Fapple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22526224%2Fmacos-monterey-best-features-macs-intel-m1-exclusive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company did promise&lt;/a&gt; that it would “continue to support and release new versions of macOS for Intel-based Macs for years to come.” But apparently, that support also means that some new features won’t be coming to Intel-based Macs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Podcasts says it’ll launch in-app subscriptions globally on June 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hB1oWJ8BHUxYyRIB0LSpudZZhEc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69428704/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JMmkd8"&gt;After some major hiccups and a delay, Apple Podcasts says it’s launching in-app subscriptions next week. The global launch of subscriptions and channels, which are groups of shows, will happen on June 15th, the company said today in an email to podcasters, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has viewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceJe91"&gt;Apple first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;debuted in-app subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; in April with a launch planned for May. It then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22459129/apple-delays-podcasts-subscriptions-june"&gt;emailed creators&lt;/a&gt; to tell them the feature launch would be pushed to June to “ensure we are delivering the best experience for creators and listeners,” likely because of issues the company introduced with a recent backend update. Through the feature, listeners can subscribe to certain shows or networks for early access and ad-free content, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNwBmt"&gt;Beyond this rollout being delayed, podcasters have complained that Apple’s latest Podcasts update, made in preparation for the subscription offerings, completely bonked the system. &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/article/apple-podcasts-lemon-bugs?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-05-28"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podnews&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago that multiple creators experienced a range of issues, including their episodes being delayed, their analytics breaking, and artwork going missing. Hopefully Apple will have all that sorted prior to this rollout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxiQLL"&gt;Meanwhile, Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;announced and launched&lt;/a&gt; its plan for subscription podcasts in the time since Apple debuted its product and delayed the release. Spotify’s solution doesn’t allow people to subscribe in-app, thereby allowing the creators and the company to skirt around Apple’s App Store fees. Instead, listeners have to navigate to an external Anchor webpage. Though that also puts a big hurdle between creators and potential subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItxBMa"&gt;Apple’s big idea is that putting a subscribe button in the podcast app could draw more premium listeners to various services, like Luminary and Wondery Plus. Those groups have had to get over the hurdle of making people subscribe in an app separate from their usual listening platform. Starting this month, we’ll finally see how powerful a subscribe button might be. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New iPhone Health app feature gives doctors easier access to data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARrzlgjEHswkBGmAjj2X9sdU65g=/0x33:1629x1119/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69428056/image__4_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone users will be able to share their Health app data directly with doctors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3fpuBY"&gt;People with smartphones and wearable devices regularly show up to the doctor’s office with readouts from apps detailing everything from their heart rate to sleep patterns. Now, with the new iOS 15 update this fall, some iPhone users will be able to send data directly from their Health app to their doctors’ electronic medical records systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPKuGC"&gt;That type of integration could make it easier for patients to share information with their doctors, said Libo Wang, a cardiology fellow at the University of Utah School of Medicine who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463322/wearables-afib-apple-fitbit-doctor-visit"&gt;studies wearables&lt;/a&gt;. “The current workflow is mildly laborious, and requires the patient to email the pdf, and a clinician manually uploading that file to create a permanent record in the official electronic medical record,” he said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joIhNj"&gt;Users could already pull in data from the other direction: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176740/apple-health-records-app-ios-update"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has allowed people to add records from &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208647"&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt; of clinics and hospitals to their Health app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf5K9k"&gt;The new integration will work with six electronic medical records companies in the United States. That includes Cerner, which controls around &lt;a href="https://www.ehrinpractice.com/largest-ehr-vendors.html"&gt;a quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the market, and five smaller groups. Apple says it could continue to add more. Doctors who use the records from those companies would be able to open any shared data within a patient’s health record. The dashboard opens as a web view directly inside the record; it doesn’t take providers to another outside app. The design is similar within the records for each of the six companies, Apple says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUX3Js"&gt;The Health app data isn’t directly transferred into the electronic health record. Doctors can see a window with the data, but the information isn’t permanently added to the record. If an iPhone user decides to stop sharing their health data, none remains within the health record. The system is built using a framework called &lt;a href="https://smarthealthit.org/"&gt;SMART on FHIR&lt;/a&gt;, an open interface for third-party applications that can work within electronic health records. Any group can create an app using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfcajx"&gt;For physicians — and particularly cardiologists — direct access to iPhone data within health records could help them make more meaningful use of the information, Wang said. One &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044126?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; found that when physicians directly reviewed the strip generated by the Apple Watch that visually shows a user’s heart rate, they were able to flag more cases of abnormal heart rhythms than the Watch’s algorithm flagged. If the rhythm strips are shared directly to someone’s doctor, the doctor might be able to identify any concerning patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UF1Tvv"&gt;The downside, though, is the potential for information overload, Wang said. More data isn’t necessarily better, particularly if doctors don’t trust its accuracy. While the data collected by wearables and smartphones may seem helpful to patients, it’s still not entirely clear if it actually helps people feel better or gives them better care, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIn4Hz"&gt;Cerner, one of the electronic health record companies participating in the initial rollout, was able to test the new Apple feature at its onsite clinic for employees. “Having secure ways to view and share this information in a clinical context has been helpful,” said Sam Lambson, vice president of interoperability at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beMShQ"&gt;It’s more and more common for patients to bring health data from their personal devices to health visits, and Lambson said Cerner is focused on efforts to incorporate that into its systems even outside of the new Apple program. One advantage of the Apple system is that it’s easy for doctors to use, said Jessica Oveys, director of product management at Cerner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3ovFu"&gt;“I think the key to it is certainly empowering and making the patient feel at the center and secure, and making it easy for them to share. But also, it’s really presenting the data in a way that’s actionable and relevant to the clinician,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDhmVq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YB0FTa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s spatial audio is sometimes amazing but mostly inconsistent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1gYZtMLk1bB46AsGjCUQv1egAwY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427941/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;At launch, it’s a very hit or miss experience&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="AQSssp"&gt;Late on Monday night, Apple flipped the switch on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;two new features for its Apple Music subscription service&lt;/a&gt;: immersive Dolby Atmos spatial audio and lossless-quality streaming. It feels like the company is really only excited about one of them, though, and it’s not the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N07Cwb"&gt;Eddy Cue is Apple’s senior vice president of services and the person who oversees Apple Music. He &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9583947/apple-music-eddy-cue-spatial-audio-lossless-future-of-music/"&gt;didn’t mince words when he told &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the sudden proliferation of lossless audio isn’t going to significantly evolve or change how we listen to music. “There’s no question it’s not going to be lossless,” he said when asked what technologies will bring about the “next-gen” of music streaming. Cue firmly stands on the side of the crowd that argues most people can’t hear any difference between CD-quality or hi-res tracks and the AAC or MP3 files that’ve been filling their ears for so long now. He did acknowledge that the higher-bit rate tracks might matter to music lovers with particularly sharp hearing or premium audio equipment, but he was also direct about how niche that group is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKCf33"&gt;“The reality of lossless is: if you take 100 people and you take a stereo song in lossless and you take a song that’s been in Apple Music that’s compressed, I don’t know if it’s 99 or 98 can’t tell the difference.” Cue revealed that he has regularly done blind tests with the Apple Music team, and they confirm how rare it is for anyone to be able to consistently recognize lossless audio. “You can tell somebody, ‘Oh, you’re listening to a lossless [song],’ and they tell you, ‘Oh, wow. That sounds incredible.’ They’re just saying it because you told them it’s lossless and it sounds like the right thing to say, but you just can’t tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKbQBn"&gt;If you go by the message that Cue and Apple are pushing, the Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio feature is where the true breakthrough is. “When I look at Dolby Atmos, I think it’s going to do for music what HD did for television,” Cue said in the &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; interview. And then he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; went in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UAmSeJ"&gt;“I think this is going to take over everything. It’s the way I want to listen to music when I’m in my car. It’s going to be the way I listen to music immediately with my AirPods. It’s going to be the way I listen to music in my house. In a way, it won’t feel very good when I’m listening to something that’s not Dolby Atmos because it’s so good. It’s like when I’m watching HD, it’s hard to go back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eqX3h9"&gt;“This requires somebody who’s a sound engineer, and the artist to sit back and listen, and really make the right calls and what the right things to do are,” Cue told &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; about mixing for spatial audio. “It’s a process that takes time, but it’s worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5rpOU"&gt;Problem is, with much of the Dolby Atmos content on Apple Music I’ve sampled so far, it doesn’t seem like everyone is making those right calls. It’s a hit-or-miss game of exploration, and songs that truly showcase the immersive potential of Atmos are more often the exception than the rule. In many cases, spatial audio tracks have an artificial wideness to them, unfamiliar placement of vocals and instrumentation, and just sound… &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;. Distant? Too reverb-y? Pick your preferred interpretation. Yet, Apple is so confident in Apple Music’s spatial audio that essentially overnight it became the default for millions of customers listening with AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nue23S"&gt;But let’s back up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xXic1j"&gt;What is spatial audio supposed to do for music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="11yuxN"&gt;In a word, it’s all about immersion. Here’s how Cue hyped it: “it makes you feel like you’re onstage, standing right next to the singer, it makes you feel like you might be to the left of the drummer, to the right of the guitarist.” On its website, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-music%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; “music created in Dolby Atmos is freed from channels, allowing artists to place individual sounds all around you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfUQw4"&gt;Whoa there. Like all of Apple’s senior executives, Eddy Cue knows how to pitch something. But if you slap on your AirPods and expect to feel like an invisible person standing in the middle of a recording session, you’ll probably be underwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RCDpv"&gt;When it’s done well, spatial audio does indeed give music a unique feeling of breadth. And it’s in a different way than a high-end pair of headphones might bring the most out of a stereo track’s soundstage. In particular, vocals often have a very distinct placement in the mix and cut through better than on traditional stereo tracks. That’s the most consistent advantage I’ve noticed with spatial audio music. But because of the different mix, you’ll very likely also pick up on details or sounds that ordinarily don’t stand out in the regular version of a song. And on the best Atmos tracks, everything has a lot more room to breathe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rw13aL"&gt;But when engineers don’t put much care into an Atmos mix, it really shows. Sometimes giving everything so much space can take the impact or crunch out of guitars. Or other aspects of a track fall flat. I’ve included just a few samples below where the spatial audio version of a song is an obvious downgrade from the original. But there are many, and when you hit a few in a row where the vocals sound weird or something’s amiss, it can detract from the listening experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B3ZRod"&gt;How many songs are available in Dolby Atmos spatial audio?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmlWUp"&gt;Apple currently isn’t providing a hard number, and is instead only saying that “thousands” of tracks are available with spatial audio at launch, with many more on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uBiKGJ"&gt;How do I know when I’m hearing spatial audio on Apple Music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="23SBGz"&gt;You’ll see either a Dolby Atmos or Dolby Audio logo appear on the Now Playing screen beneath the album artwork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o4yEjZ"&gt;A few random, good examples of Apple Music spatial audio:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QZsfzd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: if the below tracks don’t initially play as Dolby Atmos, try browsing to them from Apple’s new playlists like &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fmade-for-spatial-audio%2Fpl.154af9931b214278a64274c410046e69&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;made for spatial audio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fhits-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.ba2404fbc4464b8ba2d60399189cf24e&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;hits in spatial audio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, plus genre-specific playlists for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fpop-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.cc74a5aec23942da9cf083c6c4344aee&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Frock-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.a82d7ac0ee854d8b8a95708c76210023&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;rock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fhip-hop-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.a0c765aa555e457c9666b2a201de5506&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;hip-hop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fcountry-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.924f9f9df2294b9c97f5e40d8862f7e7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Close your eyes, and you could almost transport yourself to a small club where the spread of this mix feels like a live version of Jones’ career-making hit. Stereo doesn’t take you to the same place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPvVgB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fpaparazzi%2F1440818588%3Fi%3D1440818663&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Paparazzi” by Lady Gaga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — With a very surround sound-esque mix (skip to the second verse at 1:23 for the best examples), this is a great example of an old pop hit with an excellent spatial audio treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3pUlD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fboom%2F1445039970%3Fi%3D1445039972&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Boom” by Tiësto and Sevenn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — A fun, lively track that does give off a nice surround sound effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2NlV7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fblack-skinhead%2F1440873068%3Fi%3D1440873230&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Black Skinhead” by Kanye West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — This one is another good example of the “beyond two-channel” openness that spatial audio can provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gj4mdV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A whole lot of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fjazz-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.efbd24628ff04ff3b5e416a6e237d753&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jazz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fclassical-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.ffea4bbea2d141cbb0ec67e32059b278&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;classical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — If there are two genres that naturally lend themselves to spatial audio and Dolby Atmos, it’s jazz and classical. Orchestras can sound truly massive, and it’s a captivating way to listen to jazz ensembles where it’s easy to hear even the quietest notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x9Wd0G"&gt;Other examples where it just sounds wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LRYDOh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fbuddy-holly%2F1440878798%3Fi%3D1440879325&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Buddy Holly” by Weezer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — The guitars basically lose all life in this mix and vocals dominate the entire thing in a way that just sounds strange and bad. And yet this song is on Apple’s own playlist meant to showcase Atmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zd7B49"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Ffollow-your-arrow%2F1440858493%3Fi%3D1440858612&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Follow Your Arrow” by Kacey Musgraves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— Apple mentioned Musgraves as an artist to check out with Atmos. And while her most recent album &lt;em&gt;Golden Hour&lt;/em&gt; sounds… fine… her breakthrough &lt;em&gt;Same Trailer Different Park&lt;/em&gt; is pretty rough in spatial audio format. “Follow Your Arrow” seems to lose most of its background vocals, and even the main guitar melody is way quieter here than in the regular mix. It almost comes off like a demo recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJDOwx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fwhats-my-age-again%2F1440839912%3Fi%3D1440840493&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What’s My Age Again?” by Blink 182&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — This is another song that Apple seems to think makes spatial audio sound good, but I’d strongly argue it does the opposite. Mark Hoppus’ muffled vocals legitimately sound like they were recorded through a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zkCdc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Falex-chilton%2F698654479%3Fi%3D698654487&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alex Chilton” by The Replacements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — Is that enough cowbell for you during the chorus? It overpowers everything else and makes me feel like I’m in the old Christopher Walken &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; skit, only with a different band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2qTZ2"&gt;I’m curious to hear some of your examples that sound great, and others you’ve found that are a disappointment with Atmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NQHaSb"&gt;Do I need AirPods or Beats headphones for Apple Music spatial audio?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i47rdV"&gt;No. Apple Music’s spatial audio works on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oCk9sW"&gt;All headphones and earbuds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ICjX4a"&gt;The loudspeakers on supported iPhones, iPads, and Macs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2KknA7"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qc9Feh"&gt;If you set Dolby Atmos to “always on” in settings for the Music app, you’ll see a pop-up advising that it probably won’t sound right on all speakers, but Apple Music will still play the spatial audio mix if that’s your preference. In fact, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182"&gt;Apple clearly states&lt;/a&gt; that you can “listen on any headphones” to Apple Music’s spatial audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V229ep"&gt;How do I turn off Apple Music spatial audio if I don’t like it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5x0IvE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS and iPadOS:&lt;/strong&gt; Go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Dolby Atmos (under “audio”), and there you can pick between automatic, always on, and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PekaN7"&gt;If you’d prefer to leave Atmos on by default but want to quickly switch to a regular stereo version of any song that’s playing, just pull down Control Center, press and hold on the volume slider, and toggle off spatial audio. Apple Music will switch over to stereo. If you turn spatial audio back on, you’ll return to the Atmos track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Houvwm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;macOS: &lt;/strong&gt;In the Music app, open preferences and select the “playback” tab. Halfway down you’ll see an “audio quality” section and Atmos is in there. You get the same three automatic / always on / off choices as on Apple’s mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZeqbWk"&gt;Head tracking is coming to Apple Music spatial audio this fall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CGvFcb"&gt;Apple Music’s spatial audio is currently much different than the spatial audio experience you get when watching movies and TV shows on an iPhone or iPad. For videos, Apple includes a head-tracking feature that adjusts the sound placement as you turn your head to keep it anchored to the source device. This trick is exclusive to the AirPods lineup, but it’s a very impressive effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wONQz3"&gt;Apple has said it plans to bring this sound-changes-as-you-turn-your-head feature to Apple Music in the fall — likely with iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="83be3G"&gt;Is this just a gimmick?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JqTPw8"&gt;That’s really the question that remains to be answered. But Apple isn’t alone in hyping multidimensional music (nor is it the first to do so). Amazon, Tidal, and others are also increasingly pushing the experience. I recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22360437/sony-srs-ra5000-speaker-review-360-audio-features"&gt;reviewed an extravagant Sony speaker&lt;/a&gt; that positions 360-degree audio as its main selling point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIKRc0"&gt;Are people like Eddy Cue and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-musics-zane-lowe-explains-how-spatial-audio-will-transform-music%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zane Lowe&lt;/a&gt; right in their insistence that spatial audio will revolutionize how we consume music in the same way that stereo did? Or is this a gimmick like 3D TVs that will fizzle out and be forgotten within a few years? If it’s going to be the former, it’ll take a lot of work and creativity from artists, producers, and mixers to make this format shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92rz3E"&gt;Because right now, for every Atmos spatial audio track that’s a standout on Apple Music, there are a dozen others that are quite meh — or worse than in stereo. We’re still in the early days, and now that Atmos is officially part of Apple Music, hopefully the consistency will improve. When you do find those mixes where they totally nail it, it’s something special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tKT9hC"&gt;Apple should make it easier to switch between Atmos and stereo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jV8qIF"&gt;But in the meantime, and to avoid turning people &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; from Atmos when they land on a lackluster mix, Apple Music should make it easier to go back and forth between spatial audio and regular stereo tracks on a per-song basis. One solution could be displaying a choice when you tap on the Dolby icon, similar to the “go to artist / album” options that appear when tapping on an artist’s name. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the developer beta of iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGHU86pLQ0nPVQUSouD_cYsx_uE=/76x0:1885x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427177/apple_live_text.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gCRRF5"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;much-anticipated WWDC session&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, June 7th, Apple introduced a load of new features for its upcoming update of its iOS mobile operating system: iOS 15. The developer’s beta is now available for anyone who’d like to download it — and who is a registered developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXuH7Q"&gt;First, the obligatory warning: this version of iOS 15 is going to be very new and very beta. If you’re a developer, you know all this, but it’s worth repeating: it’s best to install this on a phone that isn’t the one that you rely on. In addition, remember that Backups Are Your Friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="81kWuD"&gt;You can find the developers beta of iOS 15 on &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/"&gt;Apple’s Developers Website&lt;/a&gt;. You will, of course, have to sign in (we’re assuming you’ve paid your $99 for a developer’s account). You may be asked to register your device if it isn’t registered already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NiJBjy"&gt;Find the iOS 15 profile by choosing Downloads (either from the button on the upper right corner, or by using the two-line drop-down menu on the upper left).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rxypZu"&gt;Look for the iOS profile, and allow the download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Uk9rC"&gt;Once the profile is downloaded, go to the Settings on your device, find “Profile Downloaded,” and follow the instructions. You will eventually be told to reboot, and then should be able to install the update that is available in Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MmG9Dh"&gt;If you’re not enrolled as an Apple developer, don’t be downhearted — there will be a public beta available for download sometime in July. When it’s available, we’ll let you know where to find it and how to install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSkEdx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em7HR0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSRbsl"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAVqQV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
