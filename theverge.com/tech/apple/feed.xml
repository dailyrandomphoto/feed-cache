    <title>Amazon stops charging extra for lossless music as Apple enters the fray</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tm0pn5XlTNwwYyvAmjOSZLokV1U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298248/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UN6rLG"&gt;Faced with new competition from Apple, Amazon today announced that it will no longer charge an added fee for the “HD” tier of Amazon Music that lets customers stream audio at CD quality and above. From now on, lossless audio will be available to all Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers at no extra charge. &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9573513/amazon-music-hd-unlimited-hi-fi-price-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; was first to report the development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ki5Wg"&gt;This makes Amazon the first company to offer lossless music at the industry’s standard $9.99 subscription rate. Amazon Music Unlimited is even cheaper ($7.99 per month) for Prime customers. And yes, the high-quality audio will also now be available for customers paying that price. Family plans are eligible for Amazon Music HD at no added cost, but student plans are exempt. Before Amazon entered the picture, the going rate for a lossless music subscription was $19.99; that’s what Tidal continues to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jByEyy"&gt;What’s making this change possible? Well, as &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; points out, with all the music streaming heavyweights now going in on lossless audio, music labels care more about pushing up subscriber count totals across these services than the higher subscription premiums that they previously demanded for hi-res audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f77R4W"&gt;The price drop for Amazon Music HD comes on the very same day Apple announced the launch of lossless audio on Apple Music. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439885/apple-music-tease-hi-fi-lossless-music-streaming"&gt;teased significant news&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend after rumors began swirling late last week about the possibility. The company’s Apple Music Android app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;spilled the details a bit early&lt;/a&gt; and signaled that an announcement could be imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZkkTB"&gt;Amazon Music HD has been performing strongly for Amazon. A previous &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; report said the service is up 100 percent year over year. The service offers over 70 million songs in CD quality, with over 7 million exceeding that and available in “ultra HD” quality. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces lossless Apple Music is coming in June at no added cost</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wvFk2LBC5fkulgzL0s-p--sSWlA=/0x0:2490x1660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298201/applemusic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIrmwc"&gt;Apple Music is getting two big updates next month: support for high-quality, lossless audio and for spatial audio through Dolby Atmos. But even more surprising, the features will be available for free to all subscribers, including those on family and student plans. The company says it’ll have 75 million lossless audio songs in its catalog by the end of the year and 20 million to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swGTf9"&gt;Apple has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that lossless audio is exclusive to Apple Music and thus subscription-only. The company won’t offer music purchases in lossless quality, nor will there be any way to upgrade owned tracks to lossless with the paid iTunes Match service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ZY83"&gt;To turn on lossless audio, subscribers must run the latest version of Apple Music and can go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Audio Quality. There, they can opt into different resolutions for different connections, like cellular, Wi-Fi, or for download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8F2ptn"&gt;Apple Music’s lossless audio starts at CD quality, which is 16 bit at 44.1 kHz, and goes up to 24 bit at 48 kHz natively on Apple devices. It tops out at 24 bit at 192 kHz. For the highest-quality “High-Resolution Lossless” experience, there’s one major catch: subscribers will need external equipment like a DAC to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiJjoi"&gt;Spatial audio and Dolby Atmos audio could prove to be an even bigger deal for Apple Music listeners. It’ll provide more immersive mixes for anyone listening through recent AirPods or Beats headphones that use the H1 or W1 chip. Spatial audio will also play through the built-in speakers on the latest versions of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac by default. To turn it on for other headphones, users will have to go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Audio and set Dolby Atmos to “Always On.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WP2Mt3"&gt;Spatial audio will be compatible with most Apple devices made in the last few years, including the Apple TV 4K connected to a compatible TV or receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DF8j3E"&gt;Lossless audio is now becoming standard across the biggest music streaming apps. Amazon just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s making Amazon Music HD available for free to Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, and Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;plans to launch&lt;/a&gt; its HiFi tier later this year. Tidal also offers what it calls “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://tidal.com/masters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22059314__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tidal Masters&lt;/a&gt;” that can even exceed high-resolution 96 kHz / 24 bit audio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler returns to Apple App Store with some content excluded</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Parler’s logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhBZOnx2uDbyOXB0f_Ta1m-KoEg=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298112/1230591653.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Thiago Prudêncio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x7GbGt"&gt;The iOS app for conservative-leaning social media platform Parler is back in the Apple App Store today, after what the company says were “months of productive dialogue with Apple.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MU99pp"&gt;“The entire Parler team has worked hard to address Apple’s concerns without compromising our core mission,” Parler interim CEO Mark Meckler said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday. “Anything allowed on the Parler network but not in the iOS app will remain accessible through our web-based and Android versions. This is a win-win for Parler, its users, and free speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNY0VW"&gt;Parler, which bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook or Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;was banned by&lt;/a&gt; Apple, Google, and Amazon following the January 6th insurrection at the US Capitol. The companies said Parler had not adequately handled violent threats and hateful content on its platform that encouraged the riot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgPcBu"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391943/apple-parler-app-store-lawmakers-hearing-google-play"&gt;reaccepted Parler&lt;/a&gt; last month, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324028/apple-parler-app-store-ban-upheld-nazi-symbols"&gt;initially rejecting its application&lt;/a&gt; for re-entry in March; Apple said at the time Parler still had “highly objectionable content,” including Nazi imagery and other hate symbols. Parler says its algorithm can now “automatically detect violent or inciting content, while still preserving user privacy. Such content has always violated Parler’s guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77C8aG"&gt;Parler remains banned in Google’s Play Store, although users can still sideload the app on Android. Parler sued Amazon, which had provided the site’s web hosting, but the suit has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;so far not fared well&lt;/a&gt; in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JCsSa"&gt;As Meckler noted in his statement, Parler’s iOS app adheres to Apple’s requirements and “excludes some content that Parler otherwise allows,” the company said in a press release. “However, that content is still visible, at the user’s discretion, on the web-based and Android versions of the platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPtXyE"&gt;After the January deplatforming, Parler struggled to resurface on the web. Former CEO John Matze said at one point even the company’s vendors and lawyers had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;“ditched” him&lt;/a&gt;. Matze was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265298/parlers-ceo-has-been-fired"&gt;fired in February&lt;/a&gt;, he said, by a board that included Rebekah Mercer, of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565344/parler-funding-conservative-mercer-app-trump-twitter-facebook"&gt;prominent conservative&lt;/a&gt; Mercer family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdXYkr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple teases major Music announcement as lossless streaming rumors mount</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/114Qih1BN4Gm7ubZptERHIF8OQU=/1x0:1111x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297485/msedge_ebejRVkHMS.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the teaser in Apple Music’s web app.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://music.apple.com" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MjXNwG"&gt;Apple is teasing a major Apple Music announcement. “Get ready,” a post in the service’s Browse tab reads, “music is about to change forever.” Tapping the image reveals an animated video, though it just consists of the music streaming service’s logo spinning in place. The teaser, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/16/apple-music-about-to-change-forever/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;first reported by MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is believed to refer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Apple Music’s rumored lossless and hi-res music streaming&lt;/a&gt; features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpuSpB"&gt;A launch of the new higher quality streaming is believed to be imminent after code referencing “Lossless” and “Hi Res Lossless” streaming tiers appeared in the service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/16/lossless-audio-references-found-in-apple-music-web-app-as-company-teases-special-announcement/"&gt;web apps&lt;/a&gt;. According to code in the Android app, the lossless tier will support music streaming at 24-bit/48Hz (a small step up from regular CD-quality 16-bit/44.1kHz), while the hi-res lossless tier will stream at 24-bit/192 kHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ScrJRu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/BEsuEUK7tr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BEsuEUK7tr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MacRumors/status/1394046356868771844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DlFqXh"&gt;Code in the Android app warns that these higher quality tiers will required more storage space and data to stream compared to existing quality. Apple Music’s current high quality tier consumes 6 MB of data for a 3-minute song, but this could rise to 36 MB with lossless, and 145 MB with hi-res lossless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFFxST"&gt;The benefit, of course, should be better sounding audio, similar to what’s already offered by the likes of Tidal, Amazon Music HD, and Deezer. Spotify has also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;its own lossless HiFi tier&lt;/a&gt; which is due to launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJTpjf"&gt;As well as lossless and hi-res streaming, code snippets also include mentions of “Dolby Audio” and “Dolby Atmos,” &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/16/lossless-audio-references-found-in-apple-music-web-app-as-company-teases-special-announcement/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The speculation is that the AirPods’ Spatial Audio features could be used in conjunction with Dolby’s surround sound technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAKwbk"&gt;Apple’s teaser doesn’t say when we should expect an official announcement, but some rumors suggest an announcement as early as Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdpd0a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy director’s Paralympics RPG is launching next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kVqUYWdXIIbeH2IwwvHMsjO8SQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297365/Rie_Ogura.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9sddg"&gt;The first project from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/em&gt; director Hajime Tabata’s new studio JP Games will finally be released next month, the company has announced. &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; is a mobile RPG themed around the Paralympic Games, and it’s the first video game ever to carry the official Paralympics license. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307399/pegasus-dream-tour-paralympics-game-hajime-tabata-2020"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; more than two years ago, but the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there’d been radio silence on the project ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOELvx"&gt;JP Games describes &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; as an “avatar RPG” set in Pegasus City. You can create a character based on a selfie from your phone, and train them in various para-sports. The game features illustrated versions of nine real-world para-athletes who compete in sports like javelin, athletics, and wheelchair basketball. Popular Japanese robot cat mascot Doraemon is also included as a guide to Pegasus City.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4bnldgiI3SheBdkRL0Rcz-HbVVY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519669/Rie_Ogura.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Badminton player Rie Ogura, who is featured in &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt;. The athletes are illustrated by Japanese artist Godtail.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="egel4u"&gt;The teaser trailer doesn’t give too much information away about how &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; will actually play, with very brief glimpses at the in-game action. The style and scope of the game appear to have changed quite a bit since its initial announcement, and Tabata suggests the Games’ delay altered the focus of the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oISx12"&gt;“The format of &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt;, which was originally planned to be a “Para-Sports RPG” was switched to that of an “Avatar RPG” in the wake of the global pandemic and the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Games,” Tabata says in a statement. “This is because I felt that the Tokyo Paralympics, which would be held after the postponement, could allow humanity to overcome their divisions and help bring our spirits together. No matter what the outcome of the Tokyo 2020 Games is, it is my wish that people everywhere will come and receive the positive energy that is abundant inside Pegasus City.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86ux3cd0xlWhOn5KKD3VaV_OHZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519667/PEGASUS_SS_02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G8EuoE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; will be available for iOS and Android on June 24th. It’s a free download with in-app purchases; JP Games says some of the profits will go to the Agitos Foundation, an organization that helps people with disabilities get involved in sports. Pre-launch registration for the game will open today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will continue to require masks in its US retail stores </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask is seen outside an Apple retail store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhAl_w0FHoyVHyOw1lEddZEV8rE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291913/1232558252.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple will keep its mask mandate in place at its US retail stores | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWfcNW"&gt;Despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Apple will keep its mandatory mask policy in place at its US retail stores for the time being,&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-15/apple-stores-keep-mask-mandate-as-company-evaluates-measures?sref=10lNAhZ9"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company informed stores that it is continuing to evaluate COVID-19-related health and safety measures, but that the policy requiring customers and employees at its Apple stores would stay in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6U0Bt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;CDC announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that people who had been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus could do away with wearing masks indoors and outdoors, and did not have to continue social distancing. There are some exceptions to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;CDC guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends people continue masking on public transit, airplanes, and trains, and in health care settings such as a doctor’s office. Immunocompromised people are advised to consult their healthcare professional before discontinuing masks, and someone who develops new COVID-19 symptoms should start wearing masks again to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLw1dp"&gt;Some retail stores across the US &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/05/14/mask-mandate-stores-change-fully-vaccinated-cdc-no-masks-indoors/5102169001/"&gt;began lifting their mask requirements&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, with large companies including Walmart, Trader Joe’s, and Costco updating their policies. But Target and CVS were among the retailers who said they would keep their mask requirements in place as they assessed the CDC guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tza6u7"&gt;In its stores that have reopened— some are open on a limited basis — Apple currently requires customers and store employees to wear masks, and provides masks for customers that don’t have their own. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbrowse%2Fstore%2Fplan_your_visit&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F15%2F22437593%2Fapple-masks-retail-stores-covid-cdc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The company’s FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; also says it requires temperature checks before anyone is allowed to enter an Apple store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd1X63"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter politely asks you to protect its targeted ad dollars in new iOS 14.5 prompt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubKsTG_gcfxb7B5-IGw6T3eiUqI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69290632/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="shKhfk"&gt;As part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; forces developers to ask permission for something they used to be able to do for free: track iOS users. Today, Twitter is joining the ranks of other developers and adding a prompt that asks users to enable tracking on iOS (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/twitter-app-tracking-transparency-support/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ2nR0"&gt;Twitter’s main justification for listening to its request is straightforward — having the feature enabled allows it to serve “better” ads. The company includes a link to settings so you can make those changes, but read Twitter’s explanation before you decide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZXbtIX"&gt;Keep ads relevant to you by allowing Twitter to track data from other companies on this device, like apps you use and websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gEzkzL"&gt;The company also includes a link to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/about-ios-tracking"&gt;a support post&lt;/a&gt; in the Twitter help center which explains why it has to ask for permission, includes a link to its current App Privacy Policy, and goes over what enabling or disabling tracking does in iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SHLWi8XOwvk6Hm6F5shHPFyKnow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515698/Image_23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Twitter ad tracking prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHoO3K"&gt;It’s a surprisingly low-key attempt to get users to allow Twitter to track them, considering the company highlighted Apple’s addition of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14.5 as a potential risk in its recent &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;earnings statement (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KRFfUZ"&gt;We continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming the global pandemic continues to improve and that we see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5. How much faster will depend on various factors, including our execution on our direct response roadmap and macroeconomic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2fOfnN"&gt;Facebook and Instagram took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;a far more aggressive approach&lt;/a&gt; to convince users its use of ad tracking is on the up-and-up — even going as far as including a vague threat that enabling tracking will “help keep Facebook/Instagram free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syShzs"&gt;Companies like Twitter and Facebook rely on tracking users to support their separate, often very lucrative ad businesses. After all, it’s usually ad sales that pay for free social networks,  and customer data helps to target those ads. As a company that’s more interested in selling hardware and subscription services, Apple doesn’t really have to worry about things like that, but brash changes like the new tracking permissions can leave developers scrambling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Qksg"&gt;App Tracking Transparency has proven popular, though — around &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/"&gt;96 percent of US users&lt;/a&gt; are opting out of tracking according to some recent surveys. And with Google considering developing its own methods for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;blocking tracking on Android&lt;/a&gt;, we might just have to get used to apps coming to us and begging for free data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple said Roblox developers don’t make games, and now Roblox agrees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Old Town Road’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/puYpnjVwmwA8V3GiN4AUvd-l9BU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69289813/LNX_Concert_Old_Town_Road.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QGnpAc"&gt;Massively popular game creation tool &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is now a massively popular &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; creation tool &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, possibly in response to the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RolHtG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; allows a variety of user-created projects on its platform, and until earlier this week, these were all grouped under a tab called “Games” on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s website. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; creators could create and manage “games” through an editor, and individual games had a user limit called “max players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ge5OgK"&gt;That’s all changed now. The “Games” tab now reads “Discover” on the web, although it still points to an address of “roblox.com/games.” Developers can create and manage “experiences,” and experiences have “max people” allowed. The word “game” has been replaced by “experience” across nearly the entire &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; website, and the iOS and Android apps now have a Discover tab instead of a Games tab — although both apps are currently classed as games in their respective stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMHOQp"&gt;“The term ‘experiences’ is consistent with how we’ve evolved our terminology to reflect our realization of the metaverse,” a &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is an online community where people do things together in virtual worlds, and over the years, we began referring to these worlds as experiences, as they better represent the wide range of 3D immersive places – from &lt;a href="https://entertainment-focus.com/2019/09/29/roblox-the-top-5-obbys-you-can-play-right-now/"&gt;obbys&lt;/a&gt; to virtual concerts – that people can enjoy together with their friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMFtj8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has used the term “experience” in place of “game” before, and CEO David Baszucki &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; a “metaverse”&lt;/a&gt; rather than a gaming platform last year. But this change happened days after a legal fight over whether &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; experiences are games — and by extension, whether &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; itself should be allowed on the iOS App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y37j5q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Goodbye games, hello Discover&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PoJlR8"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; antitrust trial has produced a weeks-long, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;frequently hilarious debate&lt;/a&gt; over the definition of a video game. Epic wants to prove that its shooter &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a “metaverse” rather than a game, pushing the trial’s scope to cover Apple’s entire App Store instead of just games. Apple wants to prove that Epic is an almost purely game-related company and that the App Store maintains consistent, user-friendly policies distinguishing “apps” from “games.” It also wants to defend a ban on “stores within a store” on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydi3Is"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; blurs the line between a large social game and a game engine or sales platform. Users don’t enter a single virtual world like &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt;; they launch individual experiences created by users. Developers can sell items within those experiences, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/z3xn4e/how-these-developers-hope-to-build-a-100-person-game-studio-inside-roblox"&gt;full-fledged game studios&lt;/a&gt; that build with &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; instead of, say, the Unity or Unreal engines. But all of this activity happens within a single &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; app, instead of as a series of separately packaged games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxMl0T"&gt;Apple has apparently worried about this fuzziness. In a 2017 email, Apple marketing head Trystan Kosmynka said he was “surprised” that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; (which he referred to as “Roboblox”) had been approved for the App Store. The email chain indicates that App Store reviewers raised concerns in 2014, but &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; was approved without ever resolving the issues. Epic brought the decision up again in court, hoping to cast doubt on Apple’s App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ou4gON"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Games have a beginning, an end, there’s challenges in place”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="odJIMn"&gt;Instead, Kosmynka justified the choice by saying that neither &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; nor its user-built projects should be defined as games. “If you think of a game or app, games are incredibly dynamic, games have a beginning, an end, there’s challenges in place,” he testified. “I look at the experiences that are in Roblox similar to the experiences that are in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft.&lt;/em&gt; These are maps. These are worlds. And they have boundaries in terms of what they’re capable of.” Kosmynka said Apple considered &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; itself an app (rather than a game) because the company used that label in the App Store, although this doesn’t appear to be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4VleQ"&gt;Besides the crucial factors of “beginning,” “end,” and “challenges,” Kosmynka seemingly argued that these experiences weren’t games because &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; contained their code in a safe, Apple-vetted &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; sandbox — making them less objectionable than standalone installable games. But Apple doesn’t use that same logic for cloud gaming services, which stream video of games from remote servers. In fact, it requires these services to list each game as a separate app. That would probably be a nightmare for &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, where experiences range from full-fledged professional projects to tiny personal spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XiWw3"&gt;Some &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; users have left irritated messages on Twitter, Reddit, and other platforms. But &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has promoted itself as a general-purpose metaverse in the past. It’s  got virtually nothing to gain by deliberately stepping into Apple’s minefield of iOS gaming rules, particularly after such an extended courtroom debate about its status. On iOS, it turns out, the only winning move is to not play — or at least not &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; anyone you’re playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXYQnI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:14PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from &lt;/em&gt;Roblox&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple confirms space gray Magic Keyboards, Trackpads, and Mice are discontinued</title>

On Apple’s store page, they’re currently for sale but with a “while supplies last” message (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/apple-discontinuing-space-gray-mac-accessories/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it will no longer sell the space gray accessories after stock runs out, but the silver variants will still be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8IkT7"&gt;The message is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316831/apple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last"&gt;same one that appeared on the iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; before it was listed as “out of stock” for good. Now that Apple’s space gray desktop isn’t around, it seems that the company’s decided to stop making the space gray accessories. It’s a bit odd, given that Apple kept the color around when it introduced the M1 MacBooks, where external mice and keyboards might still be in demand. The discontinuation of the dark accessories does raise the question of whether it will stick around in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;rumored redesign&lt;/a&gt;, though, or if Apple will go the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;colorful route it did with the new iMacs&lt;/a&gt;. (Let me buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396502/purple-iphone-12-color-photos-shade-hue-lilac-lavender"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt; iPad Pro!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “while supplies last” label only shows up for the space gray version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pr6zX8"&gt;This may also mean the death of the &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/12/imac-pro-black-lightning-cable/"&gt;Apple-made black Lightning cable&lt;/a&gt;: Apple doesn’t sell it separately, but it’s included with the space gray accessories and some Beats headphones. Truly, it’s nothing special, but now, there are three less things it comes with. I look forward to selling mine on eBay for some ridiculous price in 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDmeATrjmzOdmF7pkmI_ysHUgS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515318/IMG_1497.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may see black, but I’m seeing gold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k5KakW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article stated that the black Lightning cable only came with Space Gray accessories. It also comes with certain sets of Beats headphones. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vG0d0x"&gt;Apple might have bigger plans for next week than initially thought. The new iMac, iPad Pro, and Apple TV 4K are all set to start shipping to early preorder customers on or around May 21st, but now it seems there could be two surprise announcements: a hi-fi streaming tier of Apple Music, and maybe even AirPods 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3VVVA"&gt;The Apple Music part seems extremely likely when you factor in &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/14/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-streaming/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Digging into the latest Apple Music for Android beta app, they discovered direct references to high-resolution audio that didn’t exist previously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCJlbD"&gt;These are the prompts found in the app’s code, though they’re not user-facing quite yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KV8zLy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless audio files preserve every detail of the original file. Turning this on will consume significantly more data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWWoGL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless audio files will use significantly more space on your device. 10 GB of space could store approximately: – 3000 songs at high quality – 1000 songs with lossless – 200 songs with hi-res lossless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fbta9x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless streaming will consume significantly more data. A 3-minute song will be approximately: – 1.5 MB with high efficiency- 6 MB with high quality at 256 kbps- 36 MB with lossless at 24-bit/48 kHz- 145 MB with hi-res lossless at 24-bit/192 kHzSupport varies and depends on song availability, network conditions, and connected speaker or headphone capability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rTO1ot"&gt;It doesn’t get much more direct and clear than that, with Apple warning about both the higher data consumption of streaming lossless music and the added storage space that will be necessary to download it for offline listening. The fact that Apple has now added this data to its Android app suggests that this could all be happening sooner than later. I say that because Apple’s Apple One bundle &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/09/10/apple-one-music-unified-subscription-apk-insight/"&gt;showed up in Apple Music for Android&lt;/a&gt; just days before its public announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFONBz"&gt;The Android app code also reveals that Apple Music will offer two choices for lossless playback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dYi573"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALAC up to 24-bit/48 kHz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvETqM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High-Res Lossless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALAC up to 24-bit/192 kHz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oArq2e"&gt;So it sounds like Apple has every intention of matching what Tidal, Amazon Music HD, and services like Qobuz currently deliver. It’s also worth noting that there’ve been recent references to Dolby Atmos spatial audio in Apple Music on iOS, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/01/ios-14-6-beta-1-hinted-at-apple-music-hifi-support-with-dolby-audio-references/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IdUGhC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has stuck with 256kbps AAC since 2007&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vPDgS0"&gt;Apple has for years stuck to its customary 256kbps AAC files for both iTunes and Apple Music. When &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2007%2F05%2F30Apple-Launches-iTunes-Plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436575%2Fapple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes Plus debuted all the way back in 2007&lt;/a&gt;, that was a substantial upgrade over heavily compressed MP3s that people were downloading from peer-to-peer apps like Napster and Limewire during the height of music piracy. And it’s still perfectly adequate. Mastering of tracks has just as much influence on the listening experience as encoding details do, and Apple has tried to play to this aspect with its “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fitunes%2Fmastered-for-itunes%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436575%2Fapple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Digital Masters&lt;/a&gt;,” which aim to get the most dynamic range and detail from songs on its platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZisbz"&gt;But in terms of pure music fidelity, Apple has objectively been surpassed by companies like Tidal and Amazon over the last several years. My friend Micah Singleton has &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9572851/music-streaming-hi-fi-resolution-amazon-spotify-apple/"&gt;a great piece over at &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how we’re entering the hi-fi era of the streaming music wars. Amazon Music HD is performing strongly, with subscriptions up 100 percent year over year. Spotify has also promised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;the launch of “Spotify HiFi”&lt;/a&gt; for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lJ89M"&gt;There’s money to be made, and the ingredients are all there: Apple now sells premium headphones in the AirPods Max, and wireless carriers continue to talk up the promise and speeds of their growing 5G networks. I can’t imagine 5G will be &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; for lossless Apple Music streaming, but it’s a nice flex of the technology right in the middle of the iPhone 12 cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o9Z79u"&gt;What about those AirPods 3, though?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OwVM0N"&gt;There have already been quite a few leaks that revealed details about &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/"&gt;Apple’s next iteration of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, but the real question has been around release timing. Yesterday, a report from a site called &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/rumor-suggests-new-airpods-coming-next-week/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ReviveOldPost"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleTrack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the new AirPods could be announced alongside this new lossless tier of Apple Music. I don’t quite follow the logic, myself; no one really thinks of regular AirPods as the right choice for audiophile listening, but maybe Apple just wants new hardware of some sort to launch in tandem with the new service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9G5Hh1"&gt;Taken on its own, the AirPods rumor seems “sketchy” as &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/13/sketchy-rumor-claims-apple-will-launch-airpods-3-on-may-18/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said. But the sudden discoveries about lossless audio in Apple Music for Android seem to add some fuel to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
