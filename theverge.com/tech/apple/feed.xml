    <title>Apple says an issue is preventing some animations from using high refresh rates on the iPhone 13 Pros</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qE7KKhm4BbsB-hqoA8GkQQwKWzo=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69906241/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSCxYB"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup launched Friday, and one of the key features of the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are their ProMotion displays with variable refresh rates that can top out at 120Hz. But &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/24/iphone-13-promotion-third-party-apps/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some app animations in third-party apps are currently only running at 60Hz. That might be frustrating if you were expecting to see buttery-smooth animations across all of your apps with the new phones, but when we asked Apple what was going on, the company shared two reasons why this might be happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McbI7i"&gt;One reason is that developers will need to update their apps to declare that they use the higher refresh rate. This can be done by adding an entry to the app’s plist, Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and the company says it plans to share documentation about the entry you need to add soon. But in some cases, animations built with the company’s Core Animation technology are also affected by an issue that will be fixed in an upcoming software update, Apple says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3q9Uz"&gt;Variable refresh rate screens offer a lot of benefits, including smoother animations and scrolling when you’re using the device and battery savings the screen runs at lower refresh rates. We were impressed with the screens on the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s good to hear that third party apps will be able to take full advantage of what they have to offer — though some may have to wait until after that software update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lightning port isn’t about convenience; it’s about control</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xhSBZJ"&gt;The European Commission shook the iPhone world to its roots this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;announcing a new policy&lt;/a&gt; that would require all smartphones to adopt USB-C ports for physical charging in an effort to reduce e-waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxSmPd"&gt;Apple, of course, doesn’t offer a USB-C iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;having argued to the European Commission in the past&lt;/a&gt; that “Legislation would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers and even more Apple customers worldwide, creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wYvKqy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple obviously prefers Lightning to USB-C&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyc1No"&gt;Switching to USB-C, Apple says, would actually be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; wasteful than sticking with Lightning, since customers would need new cables and adapters — despite the fact that Apple already offers USB-C ports on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8372335/12-inch-macbook-review"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; and has managed to switch over those popular products without major issues or customer revolts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpyaTz"&gt;Notably absent from Apple’s argument, though, is the fact that cutting out a Lightning port on an iPhone wouldn’t just create more e-waste (if you buy Apple’s logic) or inconvenience its customers. It also means that Apple would lose out on the revenue it makes from every Lightning cable and accessory that works with the iPhone, Apple-made or not — along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/21/3793488/apple-changes-iphone-accessory-guidelines-is-not-standing-in-the-way-of-pop-accessory"&gt;control it has&lt;/a&gt; over what kinds of hardware &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/24/3801436/kickstarter-charging-station-pop-back-on-after-apple-changes-lightning-accessory-rules"&gt;does&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/20/3789504/kickstarter-charger-pop-turns-to-competitor-to-process-refunds-apple"&gt;doesn’t&lt;/a&gt;) get to exist for the iPhone and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/3/3451032/apple-lightning-certification-accessory-restrictions"&gt;which companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revokes-monsters-authority-to-make-licensed-accessories-1434481512"&gt;get to make them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhZP2X"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://mfi.apple.com/"&gt;MFi program&lt;/a&gt; means that if you want to plug anything into an iPhone, be it charger or adapter or accessory, you have to go through Apple. And Apple takes a cut of every one of those devices, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca7ugP"&gt;Want to connect an external display? You’ll need an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD826AM%2FA%2Flightning-digital-av-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F24%2F22690338%2Fapple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple-approved adapter&lt;/a&gt;. Import photos and videos from an SD card or flash drive? An &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD821AM%2FA%2Flightning-to-usb-camera-adapter%3Ffnode%3Da07275593a4e170d81156b6668259dc502a6abe2eb6c0ce924c9284c8a53605fa614c8df300fda18d0ae87dfa52f3d6da397bb6af24f8704e28a44772c60a3e40378d4927a3ee59ae4e80ca3a9dd46ac61bff748b417b45d1f0991f0acbf0c77a680f4c5607c22125bd513c593c20e34%26fs%3Df%253Dadapter%2526fh%253D458e%25252B45b0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F24%2F22690338%2Fapple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple-approved adapter&lt;/a&gt;. Want to use a DAC to take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple Music’s new hi-res lossless audio&lt;/a&gt;? Again, you’ll either need an MFi device or an Apple-approved USB dongle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsr815"&gt;The same, of course, isn’t true of Apple’s USB-C-based devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20750137/apple-ipad-pro-usb-c-hubs-hyperdrive-belkin-satechi-kanex"&gt;which have a robust ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; that can broadly be defined as virtually every product that uses USB-C. With a USB-C iPad, you can simply plug in flash drives and keyboards and displays and any number of useful additions that make those devices better. Apple even made a point of that fact during its latest keynote when announcing the new iPad Mini. And of course, USB-C iPads can be charged by any standard USB-C cable that’s capable of putting out enough wattage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjYAaL"&gt;The European Commission's rule could theoretically do the same for iPhones by forcing into existence the USB-C iPhone that Apple has adamantly refused to make thus far. But the new change may mean that Apple could shift towards (or accelerate its plans for) a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;completely portless iPhone instead&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than give into USB-C ports, the company could eschew ports entirely in order to shift customers towards using its proprietary charging methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kJVkbU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The EU’s USB-C proposal might give us a portless iPhone instead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FsqIic"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"&gt;It’s the sort of solution that seems obvious&lt;/a&gt; — it’s practically an intentional loophole in the EU policy — until you consider how little sense a portless iPhone makes, absent Apple’s desire to defend its accessory fees and ecosystem control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmVHtW"&gt;Switching to USB-C, a standard that’s used by virtually every other major tech product (including many of Apple’s own, like its recent MacBook and IPad lineups) would make sense. The iPhone is possibly the most popular device in the world that uses a proprietary charger, and a switch to USB-C would simplify charging setups for the millions of iPhone owners around the world. And USB-C would still allow for similar waterproofing, data transfer, and charging speeds compared to Lightning (as evidenced by any number of Android phones or Apple’s iPads.) There’s a reason the European Commission is looking to institute the new change, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91pWVK"&gt;If the EU allowed Apple to stick with Lightning, keeping that standard around also makes a certain amount of sense, even if it’s frustrating to those (like me) who would prefer a more unified charging standard. Lightning is an established ecosystem that millions of customers already have cables for, with fast data transfer and charging speeds. Like USB-C, it offers waterproofing capabilities, and it gets Apple both its licensing fees and ecosystem control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mz6m3y"&gt;But a portless iPhone that relies on MagSafe (or another wireless standard) is a baffling proposition. It would force millions of customers to have to switch to new chargers, generating tons of e-waste in the process. The result of all that cost and effort would be a charging and data transfer system that is slower and less power efficient in every way compared to wired cables, while also being larger and bulkier than a Lightning or a USB-C wire — just compare the size of one of Apple’s MagSafe cables, or the smallest Qi wireless charger, to a regular wired plug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pLiv34"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple could weather a switch to USB-C just fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="erbqvz"&gt;Apple is a $2.4 trillion company; it likely would be just fine without the revenues it gets from Lightning cable fees, should it switch to USB-C entirely. After all, there’s still plenty of proprietary Apple chargers and technologies out there to license, too, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, AirPlay, Find My, or the rumored new magnetic laptop chargers that may be in the works for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWMXCq"&gt;But profits aside, a switch to USB-C would mean relinquishing another piece of control over what iPhone owners can do with their devices outside of Apple’s carefully curated walled garden. And that, as we’ve seen time and again, is something that Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;loath to allow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much that free iPhone really costs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aoo6ErNbF9KL1EZXp8uvg7yf2gU=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69904305/lcimg_8043788f_4592_4b97_9d19_6cf11041bc74.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prices for iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone Pro Max, as announced at the 2021 Apple Event.&lt;/em&gt; | Sean Hollister&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0oPG4N"&gt;With all the carriers dangling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;sweet, sweet trade-in and upgrade offers&lt;/a&gt; to essentially give you a “free” iPhone 13 (or two) this year, one can’t help but wonder: which one is the best deal? In this case, that would be the offer that costs you the least money but gets you the iPhone you want. Between all the convoluted conditions and confusing industry jargon, the carriers certainly don’t make it easy to compare different offers or make clear what you’re signing up for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJ8Hta"&gt;Carriers might be eager to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;sign up new customers for their bottom lines&lt;/a&gt;, but you need to look out for yours too. After all, is it better to opt for a cheaper unlimited plan that requires a 36-month commitment or get instant trade-in credits to pay a little less sales tax upfront? Should you look for deals that give you instant trade-in credits or get trade-in credits in the form of bill credits over the course of your agreement? It’s sometimes hard to understand all the details until you’ve already signed the contract. To save you the trouble, I took a closer look at the fine print of these deals and did some back-of-the-napkin calculations to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lQYt37"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"},{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"},{"title":"How to buy the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCbB4ruy8_POK4LyN7eYl8Gt1vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874502/lcimg_a194780c_218b_4835_a70c_847baa93d76f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of the carrier trade-in offers are so aggressive that you can get an iPhone 13 Pro for “free.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EaCcga"&gt;In this case, I wanted to figure out which deal offers the best overall value over the long term. For example, what are my upfront and long-term costs in getting the newest iPhone for as low as free? For the sake of this exercise, I pretended to be a new customer in New York City, shopping for a single phone line, who wants to trade her iPhone 11 for an iPhone 13 or an iPhone 13 Pro,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSsTVt"&gt;Some important caveats about the numbers I’ll be referencing: they are by no means definitive and only serve to demonstrate how these deals work. For one thing, these carrier offers are time-sensitive and may already be different by the time you read this. The specifics of your carrier plan are influenced by many personal factors, like your credit history, your local tax rate, how many lines you need, and any special discounts that you’re eligible for (e.g., military/veteran). I can only present a relatively basic set of numbers that don’t reflect all the many possible variations in the universe, so take my numbers with a grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMqT8G"&gt;After comparing similar offers from AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile / Sprint, Verizon, Apple.com, I’ve noticed a few tips that would help you shop for the best deal for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1u5JP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My key takeaways...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DX9LdWjvrdsw3twULvMGJi2t2tQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874503/lcimg_998e9575_72ad_4040_91eb_7203d774a004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In some scenarios, it might make sense to pay for a device in full and instant trade-in credits, rather than rely on trade-in credits in the form of bill credits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9wZNK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the plans, not the free phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPPJpa"&gt;Most of the trade-in credits are so high that they basically cover the cost of an iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro — assuming your trade-in device is from the past two years and in good condition. So when you look at these deals, you should not get distracted by the allure of a free iPhone. Instead, focus on the cost of the plan after 24 to 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYHS5M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Length Matters Most&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrP3h3"&gt;The duration of the contract has the biggest impact on separating the best value deal from the bad. While AT&amp;amp;T offers the cheapest unlimited plan among its competition ($65/month), after 36 months (the required length you need to have service for to get the best offer), it ended up costing the most money ($2,445.30). Since most of its rivals’ plans are only 24 months long, I did the math on the AT&amp;amp;T plan at 24 months just so that I could compare apples to apples. It turns out the $65-per-month plan is the least expensive one after 24 months ($1,630.20) and is even cheaper than the special promotion between Apple and T-Mobile / Sprint ($1,713.60), which includes an extra $500 discount on the phone when you sign up for the $85 Magenta / Sprint Max plan. It’s worth gaming out the full cost of the plan for the duration of the contract before you sign on the line because this is where you’ll be spending the majority of your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxJeXh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant Trade-in Credits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmQkZL"&gt;If you can pay for the balance of your phone in full at the time of purchase and live near an eligible Apple store, you might want to take advantage of the instant trade-in credits that Apple offers. The beauty of the instant trade-in credit is that you get the value right at the time of purchase, which lowers the sales tax you pay at checkout — unlike the online trade-in process where your device has to be mailed to a third party to be evaluated before its actual value will be credited to your monthly bills in a few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5Jmy6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trade-offs with Trade-ins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpKrTX"&gt;Although my hypothetical trade-in credit for the iPhone 11 (between $800 and $1,000) effectively renders my monthly device payments to $0, because I am required to be on a monthly device payment plan as part of any trade-in offer, I may not terminate my device plan earlier than 24 months. If I do, I would be responsible for paying for the balance of this “free” iPhone, lose the remaining value from my trade-in device, and (potentially) pay an early termination penalty. Now, if I paid for the device upfront (ideally with an instant trade-in credit), I could choose a plan that better reflects my actual data consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMYJp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm4lO4"&gt;In some cases, the carrier might require you to pay a down payment or an activation fee and offer you different contract lengths based on your credit history. While you won’t be paying for your iPhone directly when your trade-in credit kicks in, you still have to pay the sales tax on the full price of the phone — there is no bill credit to reimburse that cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuCwrG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Winner: Verizon &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL7vlP"&gt;Out of all the carrier offers, Verizon actually had the lowest overall costs with its 24-month payment plans, even though it doesn’t have the cheapest 5G plan or the shortest agreement length. At $2,077.36 for the iPhone 13 and $2,086.36 for the iPhone 13 Pro, these totals don’t even include the $500 gift card that Verizon is offering to customers who switch providers. The most expensive carrier offer, on the other hand, is from AT&amp;amp;T and its extra-long 36-month contract. Not only does it cost more of your hard-earned money, but your iPhone 13 will be so out-of-date after three years that you may want to pay to end your contract early. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 Mini still gets slower MagSafe charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWeuXMt7N7rde9EUNmOF4cRROwU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903718/vpavic_210918_4760_0703.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HLI4SC"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is out Friday, and while it has a number of welcome improvements over the 12 Mini, it shares one limitation with its predecessor: the 13 Mini is still limited to peak power delivery of up 12 watts over MagSafe wireless charging, according to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211829"&gt;an Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/iphone-13-mini-12w-magsafe/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That means it, like the 12 Mini, has a lower maximum MagSafe charging speed than the rest of the iPhone 13 lineup, which can all charge at up to 15 watts over MagSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHvjDm"&gt;While it might be disappointing to hear that the smallest iPhone can charge slower over MagSafe, it does have improved battery life. Apple says you should get up to 1.5 hours more battery life than you would with the iPhone 12 Mini, so you may not need to charge the 13 Mini as often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MASWUp"&gt;That said, the 13 Mini offers less battery life than the rest of the iPhone 13 models, and it can still run out quickly. Here’s Dieter Bohn’s early impressions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;from his review&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hoFcnE"&gt;However, I do have an early impression of the iPhone 13 Mini’s battery life. It’s that Apple’s one-and-a-half hour longer claim seems reasonable, but that is faint praise. I used the iPhone 12 Mini a lot over the last year, and what I said when I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;first reviewed it&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be true: if you use this little phone like it’s a big smartphone, you will drain the battery by early afternoon or even lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycbIf"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic both in size and also in how much you use them. If you are constantly using your phone all day, the smaller battery in the Mini isn’t likely to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: iPhone 13 reviews and Microsoft’s fall Surface event</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyPEin"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vljlqj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679389/iphone-13-apple-event-vergecast-podcast-467"&gt;Last week on the show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; went through all of the announcements at Apple’s fall hardware event. This week on the show, it’s review time! Nilay and Dieter are joined by &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz and senior editor Tom Warren to discuss what they learned from spending time with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. A bigger battery and a smaller notch: is it worth the upgrade? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Lq015"&gt;The second half of the show is dedicated to another fall hardware event — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;this time from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. On Wednesday, we saw a few new devices under the Surface line: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685923/microsoft-surface-pro-8-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684814/microsoft-surface-duo-2-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt;, and a few other upgrades. The crew discusses everything announced at the event, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwadPCebCQU"&gt;hands-on demo of the devices&lt;/a&gt; that Dieter was able to experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="163BBD"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4952515068&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxhxqf"&gt;There’s a whole lot more packed into the show — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;like an EU proposal to mandate USB-C on all devices&lt;/a&gt; — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 Pro’s camera bump is a problem for the Backbone controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/085GaNsw_jS9EuF437spwptuDeg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902838/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tbCIPR"&gt;The new and very good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro lineup&lt;/a&gt; has a thicker camera bump than previous generations (7.65mm vs. 7.4mm in the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max). It sounds negligible, but it’s enough to cause a few small issues with accessory compatibility. For instance, the iPhone 13 Pro apparently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1441086122839339015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1441086122839339015%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrumors.com%2F2021%2F09%2F23%2Fmagsafe-duo-charger-iphone-13-pro-compatibility%2F"&gt;doesn’t fit perfectly onto the MagSafe Duo dual charger&lt;/a&gt; because of its size. And based on my colleague Sam Byford’s first-hand experience, it also doesn’t fit all that well when placed inside of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone One, the best iOS controller you can currently buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANcZVf"&gt;The Backbone One has a, for lack of a better word, backbone that connects each side of the controller. The iPhone 13 Pro’s camera bump causes the phone to rest unevenly while nested in the Backbone One, making it wobble during use. That’s not a huge issue in itself, aside from the fact that the phone is technically less secure in the controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CUUPJ"&gt;But he reported a few disconnect issues while playing, too. And if the device isn’t flat while connected via the controller’s Lightning jack, there’s reason to believe that it could be putting stress on the iPhone 13 Pro’s Lightning port, which may amount to a bigger problem over time. So, keep this in mind if you already have one of these controllers and expect a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Backbone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xux0sfkYNlBFKkOJJ_X76uRpLYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874715/IMG_0225.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sam Byford&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A side angle of the iPhone 13 Pro fit into the Backbone One controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YU1B23"&gt;We’ve reached out to Backbone to comment on this issue. But this problem isn’t isolated to just this company. Presumably, there are several bespoke accessories, in and outside of the realm of gaming, made to fit iPhones and Android phones up to a certain level of thickness. But as mobile photography gets more advanced, the sensors and lenses built into phones will likely get larger, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnEfwf"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6jbBS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to buy the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKF7xFC4hTYRm-7tz1b73WWCeWk=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857848/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the colors of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIBU9V"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;a fleet of new products at its “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;. Chief among them — you guessed it — was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. This one is coming in various sizes and colors, but with smaller notches, the new A15 Bionic chipset, and with redesigned and improved cameras located around the back. Going from smallest to largest, Apple will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and finally the iPhone 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;With the Pro and Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be able to get the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage, along with 120Hz refresh rate displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1YGEt"&gt;If you’re looking forward to ordering any of the four iPhone 13 models, the good news is you no longer need to preorder and wait around. If you haven’t already ordered one, there’s a good chance you pick one up from your local Apple store, or from your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIozlV"&gt;If you’re curious about all of the options and how much it’ll all cost, we’ve listed all of that info below for buying unlocked. All of the carrier-specific promos, including trade-in deals, are listed at the bottom of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7zyyJ"&gt;How to buy the iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7E96Ug"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is the 2021 iteration on the Mini phone form factor with a 5.4-inch OLED screen. Apple says that this newer version should get better battery life than the previous model. Battery life was one of the few disappointments in the iPhone 12 Mini, so it’s good that Apple seems to have made improvements here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytXyfk"&gt;Apple sells the iPhone 13 Mini starting with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $729&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to opt for more storage with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; versions for $829 or $1,029, respectively. If you purchase through a carrier via Apple’s site, the starting price of each configuration drops $30, starting at $699. If you want to trade in your phone, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check for its value right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nPdN53"&gt;How to order the iPhone 13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DVnDHN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 has a 6.1-inch OLED display, the same size as last year’s model. Like other models this year, Apple upgraded the internal chipset to the A15 Bionic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NHlw2"&gt;Buying them unlocked will cost you $30 more than buying through a carrier, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $829 for the 128GB version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$929 for the 256GB version&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,129 for the 512GB version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGvHEm"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find out your phone’s value at Apple&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in for credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BaJlBq"&gt;How to buy the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eBv8ru"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are the biggest and most capable models coming out of Apple in 2021. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch OLED display with an A15 Bionic chipset, while the Pro Max has a bigger 6.7-inch OLED. Both support up to 120Hz refresh rate, which is an improvement that’s long been anticipated. However, you’ll also pay a lot more for this model than the base iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAUxcl"&gt;At Apple, the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models start at $999 and $1,099, respectively. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; will run you $1,099, while the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; will cost $1,199. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration&lt;/a&gt; of either model will also cost an extra $200, with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,499 and the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,599. Unlike the iPhone 13 Mini and standard iPhone 13, there’s no $30 price difference if you choose to purchase the Pro line unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHpfYv"&gt;As mentioned before, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s site can tell you how much your current phone is worth&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wmtN87"&gt;iPhone 13 lineup carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jzmr1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; Current and new Verizon users can save on any of the iPhone 13 models with a trade-in if you’re on certain unlimited plans, billed back to you in monthly credits over the course of 24 or 30 months. New customers can get an additional $500 worth in credits by switching carriers to Verizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74PqP"&gt;How much you’ll get in trade-in credit varies depending on the phone you want, with up to $1,000 back in billing credits if you buy the iPhone 13 Pro Max and have an unlimited plan. If you’re after the 128GB iPhone 13 Pro that usually costs $999, trading in select phones can make it free after you’ve received billing credits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n71NlO"&gt;If you want the iPhone 13, Verizon will offer those on an unlimited plan up to $800 for a trade-in, and you’ll get reimbursed via billing credits. For an iPhone 13 Mini, trade in values cap at $700.  &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.verizon.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKEbcd"&gt;According to a Verizon spokesperson, these are the phones that will get the most amount of trade-in value (though the carrier will accept most phones in any condition, but battery damage is a deal-breaker): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vp61Ou"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="R3SAWq"&gt;These are the mid-tier devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xce8xP"&gt;Apple: iPhone X and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u4VbAe"&gt;Samsung: GS9 and Note 9 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OSmNtc"&gt;Google: Pixel 4A and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lcmacj"&gt;Kyocera: DuraForce Ultra &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5PQFGX"&gt;LG: V50 ThinQ and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3IkQLY"&gt;Motorola: Moto One 5G, RAZR, Edge Plus &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FgPHff"&gt;Nokia: 8 V 5G &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a1j0LX"&gt;OnePlus: 7 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UxtFME"&gt;Sony: Xperia 1 and up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jp0kUn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; New and existing T-Mobile users can get up to $800 in trade-in credit toward an iPhone 13 series phone. This deal is available for customers on the Max plan, and you’ll get the credit paid back to you in 30 monthly bill credits. T-Mobile’s “Forever Upgrade” initiative will let Max plan holders get up to $800 in trade-in credit for future trade-ins, including this one. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-iphone-deals%2Fupgrade-benefits&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665165%2Fapple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit T-Mobile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nQiuJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; New and current AT&amp;amp;T subscribers on an unlimited plan who trade in a phone, then purchase an iPhone 13 series phone on an installment plan can get a good deal after all of the billing credits have come in. You can get up to $1,000 in billing credits if you trade in a phone that’s worth $180 or higher, making the iPhone 13 Pro Max a better deal. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-128gb-silver.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone is using old Jawbone patents to sue Apple and Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jawbone Up hands-on pictures (2012)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbFw6EXUFgunBve-hce0e2rfupA=/4x0:1021x678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902309/DSC_3053-hero.1353975716.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jawbone is best known for its fitness trackers, but the recent lawsuits focus on noise-isolation tech used in its earphones.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IaIozz"&gt;Wearables company Jawbone is long-dead — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15931080/jawbone-going-out-of-business-report"&gt;went out of business&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 — but its patents live on, and someone is using them to sue Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU1dh5"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/jawbone-ghost-rises-to-sue-google-apple-over-ear-pods-phones?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, an entity named Jawbone Innovations LLC filed lawsuits against the two tech giants this week in federal court in Waco, Texas. The suits allege that Apple and Google infringed eight patents previously belonging to Jawbone and focused around noise-isolation algorithms originally developed for DARPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8Q2uT"&gt;The suit against Apple names the infringing devices as “all versions and variants of Apple iPhone, iPad, AirPods Pro, and HomePod products,” while the suit against Google is similarly broad, naming “all versions and variants of Google smartphones [...] tablets and/or notebooks [...], earbuds [...] smart home devices [...] and other Android Devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fepgoo"&gt;Both suits demand a preliminary injunction against the companies to stop them from selling the allegedly infringing products, and future royalties for the use of these patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E9JK7f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Who is behind the lawsuits is unclear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qEeawd"&gt;If all this seems like a little bit of legal skulduggery, well, who are we to disagree. As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, exactly who or what is behind the lawsuits is unclear, but it’s not the first time Jawbone Innovations LLC has made such claims. The same entity — which does not appear to be contiguous in any meaningful way with the original Jawbone, apart from owning the latter’s intellectual property — &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/jawbone-samsung-patent-infringement-lawsuit"&gt;sued Samsung&lt;/a&gt; in June for similar infringements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epE8Rd"&gt;And, as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/jawbone-samsung-patent-infringement-lawsuit"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in its reporting of that case, the manager of Jawbone Innovations LLC, one &lt;a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_tx/0803920236"&gt;York Eggleston&lt;/a&gt;, also seems to have prior form, with an individual of that name also managing other LLCs that were &lt;a href="https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/patent/968064/additional-former-ibm-patents-move-from-daedalus-to-another-npe"&gt;assigned old IBM patents&lt;/a&gt; before suing Lyft and Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIxmUO"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes, filing such lawsuits in Waco, Texas makes sense, as it’s “a district that’s the most popular in the nation for its patent-friendly judge and juries.” Though even the patent-friendly might reject these particular claims. A spokesperson for Google told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg: “&lt;/em&gt;We dispute the claims, and will defend ourselves vigorously.” We’ve reached out to Apple for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVKAQu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Update your new iPhones and iPads to avoid Apple Music bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFhpQs54LkPY18tEIBEcAT9nbDc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902301/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dwikbh"&gt;If you’re an Apple Music user and recently bought a new iPhone 13 model, new ninth-generation iPad, or a sixth-generation iPad Mini, there’s an important update to download to avoid an annoying bug. A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212822"&gt;Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; says a bug affecting those devices restored from a backup can prevent users from accessing the Apple Music catalog, Apple Music settings, or using the services’s Sync Library feature. My colleague Chris Welch reports that he ran into this bug on iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYGNZS"&gt;Thankfully, the fix is very simple, according to Apple. Just head into the “General” section of the “Settings” app, select the “Software Update” option and hit “Install Now,” to get the update. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/apple-music-backup-restore-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that its release notes don’t explicitly mention the Apple Music bug, but this is presumably the update Apple’s support page is referencing. Apple says applying the update should resolve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s rumored MacBook Pros could get higher resolution screens, according to beta leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40xb5PsG1u-8jRMbXPaKh99SQPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69901962/akramer_201113_4290_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pro with an M1 chip.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Alexander Kramer for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hwGEpi"&gt;The latest macOS Monterey beta contains clues about the resolution of Apple’s rumored 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/macbook-pro-2021-resolutions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The seventh beta of the upcoming operating system contains references to “3456 x 2234 Retina” and “3024 x 1964 Retina,” which are two resolutions not supported in any of Apple’s current Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxCILs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; theorizes that the two new resolutions correspond to Apple’s much rumored 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;widely expected to launch this year&lt;/a&gt; with new designs and a new Arm-based Apple processor called the M1X. For reference, the current 16-inch MacBook Pro has a resolution of 3072 x 1920, while the current 13-inch MacBook Pro’s display sits at 2560 x 1600. If the new resolutions are accurate, both laptops should see an increase in pixel density as well as screen resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vPIvM"&gt;As well as the improved screen resolutions, both laptops are rumored to feature a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;revived magnetic MagSafe laptop charger&lt;/a&gt; and the return of useful &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;ports like an SD card slot and HDMI&lt;/a&gt;. The widely disliked OLED Touch Bar is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;reportedly on the way out&lt;/a&gt;. The new laptops are expected to be announced at an Apple event this year, although an exact date is yet to be made public. &lt;/p&gt;
