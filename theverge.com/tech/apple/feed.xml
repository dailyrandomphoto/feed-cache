    <title>The Wordle clones have disappeared from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zZmq0Lstg1m_wcC2YCTG26fErM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377148/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier today, the App Store was overflowing with games ripping off a viral web app. &lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLIZAP"&gt;Has Apple taken action against apps that cloned the popular web game Wordle? They have now disappeared from the App Store, after &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/psa-wordle-clone-with-annual-subscription-is-the-latest-rip-off-to-hit-the-app-store/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wordle-copycat-app-store-twitter"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) called out a flood of copycats so blatant as to be named “Wordle” and that featured the same gameplay and UI, each taking advantage of the fact that developer Josh Wardle didn’t create an Apple app of his own. While we’re still seeing a few clones on the App Store, they don’t use the Wordle name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMeMb6"&gt;The clone apps had a spotlight shone on them today, when one developer &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/tech-dude-rips-off-wordle-angers-internet-1848341422"&gt;started bragging about how many downloads his version of Wordle was getting&lt;/a&gt;. Following some intense backlash from the community, he set his account to private, but people had already started finding many other apps like it on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eXFsor"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yYQOJeNtNEEZB_72WBwboMnXZj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162051/IMG_3661.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search results for Wordle at 5PM ET today, showing two clones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBxGL0BzrKpXmt9N2ro0h_yUC18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162334/IMG_3666.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search results for Wordle at 8:08PM ET — the first results are now an app from five years ago, and a story about Words With Friends 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fdr2q4"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for confirmation that it was the one that took action against the Wordle-alikes, but it seems vanishingly unlikely that each developer decided to take down their app in the space of about an hour. If Apple really is initiating a crackdown on the apps, it’s tipping the scales significantly to protect the original game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KGNEZ"&gt;While there have been similar high-profile situations in the past — &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/wordle-clone-ios-mobile-gaming"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones"&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/28/5556760/threes-developer-releases-emails-showing-work-in-reply-to-clones"&gt;Threes vs 2048&lt;/a&gt; come to mind — it’s hard to think of a recent example where Apple stepped in as heavily as it seems to have done today. Apple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#copycats"&gt;does have language about copycats in its developer guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s notably vague: “Come up with your own ideas,” section 4.1 reads. “Don’t simply copy the latest popular app on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s name or UI and pass it off as your own.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ooG9T"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/apple-goes-after-clones-and-spam-on-the-app-store/"&gt;questions about how Apple would deal with blatant clones&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s seemingly let things slide in some instances. With disappearance of the Wordle-alikes from the App Store, we may have gotten a precedent for how similar is too similar. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile say they’re not blocking Apple’s iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVCnW6IcjHg1auWUvneXHpkTC_U=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376980/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsPVr9"&gt;T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T — the three biggest US cellular carriers — have all confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they aren’t blocking Apple’s new iCloud Private Relay feature, following reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;some customers were having issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;with the VPN-like feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjO0fq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon straight-up say they’re not blocking the feature from functioning. Verizon spokesperson George L. Koroneos confirms that Private Relay works on both cellular and Fios internet connections, and AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson Seth Bloom says the carrier’s policy is not to block Private Relay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IG6Sn"&gt;T-Mobile’s situation is a little more complex: most customers shouldn’t have any issues with iCloud Private Relay. But those who use content filtering services (like the carrier’s Family Controls) won’t be able to use iCloud Private Relay, the carrier tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fa5X2u"&gt;“Customers who chose plans and features with content filtering (e.g. parent controls) do not have access to the iCloud Private Relay to allow these services to work as designed. All other customers have no restrictions,” T-Mobile spokesperson Bennet Ladyman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That tracks with Apple’s messaging around the feature, which notes that “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uuaZLl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"T-Mobile identifies issue that prevented some iPhone users from using Private Relay","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X5VL8i"&gt;T-Mobile’s spokesperson also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the carrier &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; find an issue with Apple’s recent iOS 15.2 update that caused iCloud Private Relay to be toggled off following the update. “Overnight our team identified that in the 15.2 iOS release, some device settings default to the feature being toggled off. We have shared this with Apple. This is not specific to T-Mobile.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnIzGG"&gt;If the problem really is on Apple’s end, it could also explain the issues that some Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T customers may have been experiencing in the wake of the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o68AKN"&gt;That said, it’s possible that carriers may sour on supporting Apple’s privacy feature in the future. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22878885%2Fverizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Vodafone, Telefonica, Orange, and T-Mobile have all signed a joint letter asking the European Commission to block Private Relay, arguing that the feature is “cutting off other networks and servers from accessing vital network data and metadata, including those operators in charge of the connectivity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZv0Sy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;iCloud Private Relay&lt;/a&gt; is similar in many ways to a VPN, working to automatically mask your internet traffic from both Apple, your ISP, and anyone else trying to snoop around what you’re doing online. The feature is still in beta but is currently available to anyone subscribing to a paid iCloud plan — although Apple doesn’t keep it toggled on by default, at least for now. There are other limitations, too: Private Relay won’t let you spoof your internet as coming from outside your rough geographic area (a popular use for VPNs to get around national or regional content limits), and it only works in Apple’s own Safari browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Apm9t5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lw21bUEW8l0kQjcVdBZ7XBEnmGI=/16x0:1110x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376898/IMG_3664.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copies of the popular web app have made it past App Review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oddcq1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, the word-guessing puzzle game that’s &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/09/lifestyle/what-is-wordle-why-is-everyone-twitter-playing-it/"&gt;taken over our Twitter timelines&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t currently have an official app. That may come as a surprise to anyone who’s searched for it on the App Store, though — earlier today, doing so would show you several blatant unofficial copies, each of which use the same name and mechanics as the original, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;was made by Josh Wardle&lt;/a&gt; and distributed on the web for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iobEAS"&gt;Most people who’ve been online recently will have had at least some exposure to Wordle if they haven’t been playing it themselves (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it has 2 million daily players). It’s a simple concept but done well: each day, you go to the Wordle website, where you’re given five chances to guess a five-letter word. The game gives you feedback about what letters you’ve put in the right place, what letters are in the word, but not in the order you’ve picked and what letters aren’t in the correct answer. Certain parts of Twitter have been taken over by black, green, and yellow square emojis, which players use to show off their gameplay without spoiling the word of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="io8n5e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As with many good viral ideas, Wordle has spawned waves of parodies and memes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sVgm5Z"&gt;As happens to most good ideas (especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones"&gt;the ones that go viral&lt;/a&gt;), there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2022/1/11/22877996/wordle-spoofs-alternatives-letterle-sweardle-queerdle"&gt;several clever parodies of Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fobwashed/status/1480975713620541440"&gt;waves of jokes&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter using the emoji block format that players use to share their scores. But while many of the parody versions point users back to the original, this doesn’t seem to be the case for the versions on the App Store. Instead, they try their best to look like the web version without mentioning that they’re actually a spin-off. Trying out five versions of the game from the App Store, only one seemed to acknowledge Wardle’s version — ironically, it was one of the few that didn’t actually call itself Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GOchjE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10973311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="7978Mo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;The weird world of 'Flappy Bird' clones&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9wtMf3"&gt;The situation is a little embarrassing for Apple, which has often cited its high standards and App Review process as a reason it should be allowed to keep control over which apps run on iPhones and iPads. The review process has been called into question by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;scams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;controversies&lt;/a&gt;, but these feel especially blatant — they’re using the same name and have an extremely similar interface to the original. It’s easy to see many people being tricked into thinking that they’re playing an official version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEfdJN"&gt;Even worse is that the apps are copying a website, months after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417725/apple-vs-epic-full-trial-slideshows-opening-arguments"&gt;championed&lt;/a&gt; progressive web apps in court as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;an option for developers during its legal battle with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. That argument may fall flat with developers targeting mobile audiences. As Owen Williams, a UX manager, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/1480984480538005504?s=20"&gt;points out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, they won’t even get a seat at the table when someone searches for their creation on the App Store (which is something a lot of people might do if they, say, see a flurry of tweets with the name of a Cool New Thing everyone’s playing with).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tyno2K"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If Apple and Google were *actually* allowing proper competition, you’d be able to register a PWA/web app in their stores if you choose that route instead of a native app. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But uh, that doesn’t help build their walled gardens so we get…this&lt;/p&gt;— Owen Williams ⚡ (@ow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/1480984480538005504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vqJ57J"&gt;To add insult to injury, it appears that Wordle clones aren’t nearly as rampant on Google’s Play Store. Only one of the first two dozen search results for “wordle” appeared to be a clone, and it was buried deep behind a “show more” button. Google Play reports the app has “500+ downloads” — the developer behind one of the Wordle clones on iOS claimed to be getting 5,400 downloads an hour on Twitter, and their version wasn’t even in the top three search results. (The same developer tweeted a screenshot of a notification saying that their app was waiting for review, with the caption “let’s see what Apple thinks” prior to the app going live.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LibNuw"&gt;Wardle hasn’t monetized his version of Wordle with ads, subscriptions, one-time payments, or a tip jar. It’s totally free. According to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html"&gt;a profile in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he made the game for his partner, who enjoyed crossword puzzles. “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun,” Wardle said of Wordle’s success. “It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs. It’s just a game that’s fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="3yUEzd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re going to the fucking moon”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hkZLp8"&gt;The Wordle apps I tried haven’t copied the original’s lack of a monetization scheme. Some showed a plethora of ads, often with the option of paying to remove them, and one even had a $30-a-year in-app purchase to unlock the “Pro” version. (That particular app’s developer said on their now-private Twitter account that the app was “going to the fucking moon” and that one of their goals for 2022 was to “make tons of fucking money.”) Paying would let you choose how many letters you wanted in the words and would allow multiple games a day. As &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/01/wordle-game-online-free-explained.html"&gt;many have noted&lt;/a&gt;, the real Wordle’s once-a-day play is another one of the things that makes it so appealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ugXCOB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Added a share button to Wordle that generates a spoiler-free emoji grid for you. Shoutout to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/irihapeta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@irihapeta&lt;/a&gt; for inventing such a cool way to share your results each day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛&lt;br&gt; ⬛  ⬛&lt;br&gt;     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wordle 180 3/6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try it out: &lt;a href="https://t.co/pZTmeT1p7E"&gt;https://t.co/pZTmeT1p7E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Wardle (@powerlanguish) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1471493886031773707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYMB2N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle’s developer explaining the game’s share function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3SU7O"&gt;Most of the apps I tried didn’t have any obvious copies of the original’s share feature, which lets you easily copy a series of spoiler-free blocks to share with friends or on social media. The one that offered the $30 subscription, however, did — adding a few extra words and saying “The Wordle App” in place of Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tqv7X7"&gt;Keeping blatant copies off the App Store might not be an easy moderation task if Apple wanted to do it — for example, there are a few games on the App Store that share the “Wordle” name but not gameplay. However, they’re pretty obviously not trying to capitalize on a trend by copying a popular app — many of them haven’t been updated in years (and are therefore not likely requiring any judgment calls from App Review). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VdUXQ"&gt;It appears that Apple has decided to try, though. Roughly an hour after we published this post, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1481063416630583300"&gt;we heard&lt;/a&gt; that the clones had started disappearing from the App Store. All the ones we saw that used the word “Wordle” in their title are now gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdiT6Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to both Apple and one of the developers behind a Wordle clone. Neither responded to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hw18VC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Wordle clones are now disappearing from the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile said Tuesday that it had not blocked iCloud Private relay, and that it had identified what was causing some iPhone users to appear blocked from using the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OE9nGi"&gt;“Overnight our team identified that in the 15.2 iOS release, some device settings default to the feature being toggled off. We have shared this with Apple. This is not specific to T-Mobile. Again though, we have not broadly blocked iCloud Private,” the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1480987702363189248?s=20"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reporter Mark Gurman. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhyPo0"&gt;iCloud Private Relay lets users hide the websites they visit from third parties, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/t-mobile-block-icloud-private-relay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;VPN-like Private Relay&lt;/a&gt; hides your web activity from any outside sources — including Apple and your carrier — and prevents anyone from identifying you or the sites you access. It’s currently available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;via a subscription to iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwCA9M"&gt;Private Relay is still in beta in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and it isn’t turned on by default. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;You have to go into your iPhone’s settings to switch it on&lt;/a&gt;, which is where some T-Mobile customers first noticed the message above appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z095du"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480631410239094797?s=20"&gt;a reply to that tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the user shows what happens when you click the “Learn More” button below the initial message — there, Apple explains why T-Mobile might be blocking the feature. “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay,” it reads. “Your cellular provider may be providing network-based services, such as Parental Controls, requiring them to view the traffic on your network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oYDJF"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iCloud Private Relay conflicts with a number of T-Mobile services, but that doesn’t appear to be the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4ZROa"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/european-carriers-seek-to-block-iphone-private-relay-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iPhone users in Europe were the first to notice that access to the Private Relay feature wasn’t working. T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica added their names to an open letter published in &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/01/09/apple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that criticizes the feature. Carriers argue that Private Relay “will impair others to innovate and compete in downstream digital markets and may negatively impact operators’ ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $19 polishing cloth is back in stock online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BFtKsVDD9wBdeVm05pluPcOn08=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375574/MM6F3_AV2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy the cloth once again.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGwWdl"&gt;Apple’s $19 polishing cloth is back in stock &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1235321/7613?subId1=Verge%252C%2520Apple%2520Polishing%2520Cloth%2520News%2520Post%252C%25201%252F11%252F22&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMM6F3AM%2FA%2Fpolishing-cloth" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at the company’s online store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/the-nightmare-is-over-the-apple-polishing-cloth-is-back-in-stock-and-ready-to-ship/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The very expensive piece of cloth was first introduced following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;Apple’s October event&lt;/a&gt;, but it was quickly backordered — &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/11/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was “impossible” to get one before the holidays — so if you’ve been waiting to get one, now’s your chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIrJTx"&gt;“Made with soft, nonabrasive material, the Polishing Cloth cleans any Apple display, including nano-texture glass, safely and effectively,” reads Apple’s description of the cloth on its product page. Sounds perfect if you need to clean a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161487/apple-mac-pro-display-xdr-review-6k-lcd-screen-price-features"&gt;Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt; with the nano-texture glass screen. That already costs $5,999 — the nano-texture glass is a $1,000 upgrade from the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1235321/7613?subId1=Verge%252C%2520Apple%2520Polishing%2520Cloth%2520News%2520Post%252C%25201%252F11%252F22&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fpro-display-xdr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard model&lt;/a&gt; — and if you want Apple’s official stand for the display, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/3/18651001/apples-mac-pro-xdr-display-monitor-stand-expensive-dongle-not-included-wwdc-2019"&gt;you’ll have to drop an additional grand&lt;/a&gt;, so what’s another $19 for the company’s polishing cloth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StcXNF"&gt;It appears that the cloth isn’t in stock at the company’s retail stores; it isn’t available for in-store pickup at any of the stores near me. If you order one as I write this, though, Apple says it will be delivered by Friday. While you’re waiting for your order to arrive, don’t miss &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54122%2Fmacbook-pro-2021-teardown%23cloth&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F11%2F22878673%2Fapple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit’s actual teardown of the cloth&lt;/a&gt; — which is actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753184/ifixit-apple-polishing-cloth-19-repair-backorder"&gt;more interesting than you might expect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The excellent Beats Fit Pro earbuds are coming to many more countries on January 28th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ayG7Wf6Tozvi1zlC44rD7MSdLg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375456/DSCF6033_Edited.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIDPIb"&gt;Beats’ best earbuds yet, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt;, were only available in the United States immediately upon their release a few months ago. Apple then launched the earbuds in China, but now they’re set to become much more widely available on January 28th. That’s when the Beats Fit Pro will launch across Canada, Europe, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV04z1"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beatsbydre/status/1480947737118101506"&gt;a tweet from the Apple-owned brand&lt;/a&gt;, preorders for the “worldwide” release will begin on January 24th before the buds hit shelves on the 28th. The Beats Fit Pro include flexible wingtips that help them (comfortably) stay anchored in your ears without coming loose — even during exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaoI5x"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-canada-europe-japan-release-date-161335850.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in Europe the Beats Fit Pro will be priced at £200 / €230; in Canada they’ll cost $250 CAD; and in Japan you’ll be able to get them for 24,800 yen. As in the US, the Fit Pro earbuds will be offered in black, white, gray, and purple. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptNyqVVjvt3IM3On3kkY-q2tLvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973260/DSCF6027_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds are basically a sportier version of the AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OYFwzG"&gt;They feature the same active noise cancellation system as the AirPods Pro, IPX4 water resistance, and also support head tracking when listening to spatial audio. Battery life is rated at up to six hours on a charge, with the case good for another 21 hours. They don’t check off all the bells and whistles: there’s no wireless charging, for example, and AirPods still perform better on voice calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tG3gc5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Beats Fit Pro review: sporty AirPods Pros with better sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gLqzYG"&gt;But they maintain most of Apple’s ecosystem tricks while delivering arguably better, more powerful sound in a fit that offers superior stability. They’re our top pick for workout earbuds, but I find myself using them just as regularly for everyday listening.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple promises third-party payment options in iOS for South Korean users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQJQNIA8NaFSDyGKzKg3lYPgVCM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373581/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="20az7S"&gt;Apple says it will introduce third-party payment options for the first time ever in iOS apps,  following South Korean legislation designed to open up the perceived monopolies of Google and Apple’s app stores. The alternative payments will only be available in South Korea and follows the announcement of similar changes by Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments"&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QknUEg"&gt;Apple’s decision was shared by the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) and reported by &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20220111004700320?input=tw"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News Agency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but details of the implementation are thin on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pFNs7Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arguments over payment fees triggered the Epic Games trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0W7ewy"&gt;Apple currently charges developers a 30 percent fee on any digital purchases made by consumers using iOS apps. This fee has become increasingly contentious for developers, and was at the heart of the huge US lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;between Apple and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the lawsuit, a judge ordered Apple to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;allow third-party payments&lt;/a&gt; in the App Store, but this order was later put on hold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;due to an appeal&lt;/a&gt;. (Apple has since made a tiny concession to “reader apps” like Netflix, allowing them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;link to websites to sign up users for new accounts&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s nothing like allowing in-app third-party payments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOsnAI"&gt;In South Korea, lawmakers have upheld complaints by developers about in-app payments, leading to new legislation. Apple says its will charge developers a reduced fee to use third-party payment options (just as Google has promised for its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments"&gt;third-party payment support&lt;/a&gt;), but some developers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1480807630817878020"&gt;say it’s unfair&lt;/a&gt; for these companies to charge any fee at all. Apple and Google say fees are necessary to maintain and promote their app platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43SzGz"&gt;Apple has not said how much it will charge developers to implement third-party payments in South Korea, or when this option will be available, or how exactly these new payments will be made available to consumers. The exact details of the implementation will be vitally important, as seemingly small decisions in things like app store UI can be used to steer consumers one way or another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PU1Ya1"&gt;“Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea’s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country’s talented app developers. Our work will always be guided by keeping the App Store a safe and trusted place for our users to download the apps they love,” Apple told &lt;em&gt;Yonhap &lt;/em&gt;in a press statement. “We look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google exec says Apple is ‘holding back’ customers who text</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ubml4b"&gt;On Saturday, Android boss Hiroshi Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876067/google-apple-ios-android-imessages-bullying-lockheimer"&gt;accused Apple of “using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products&lt;/a&gt;,” after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; revealed how US teens have turned Apple’s iMessage into a social status symbol that locks Android users out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6YMP"&gt;Now, Lockheimer is taking a slightly less abrasive stance: the Google executive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777"&gt;said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that “we’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hhiPL1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.&lt;/p&gt;— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alkhQP"&gt;“By not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663659135176705"&gt;adds Lockheimer&lt;/a&gt;, later in the Twitter thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgvZlc"&gt;That’s still a big accusation, but one that pulls the conversation back into familiar territory: will Apple &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1446193676883922953%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22715696%2Fsvp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;accept Google’s olive branch&lt;/a&gt; to make iMessage more compatible with Android, or will it continue to use lock-in to sell more iPhones? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOt9Oq"&gt;On the lock-in front, there’s little question about Apple’s motivation. Thanks to the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the world has now seen confidential emails&lt;/a&gt; between Apple executives that show  the company is intentionally withholding iMessage in favor of lock-in. “I am concerned the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043920-2013-april-federighi-and-schiller-tell-cue-not-to-bring-imessage-to-android-lockin/#document/p2"&gt;wrote Apple exec Craig Federighi in April 2013&lt;/a&gt;, adding “I think we need to get Android customers using and dependent on Apple products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWOCzA"&gt;“Joz and I think moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043935-2016-march-phil-schiller-why-imessage-lockin-is-important/#document/p1"&gt;wrote Apple’s Phil Schiller in March 2016&lt;/a&gt;, forwarding an email from Beats Music co-founder Ian Rogers about how he “missed a ton of messages from friends and family” after switching to an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCGNOG"&gt;What’s less clear is whether RCS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"&gt;the next-gen replacement for SMS that’s championed by Google&lt;/a&gt; and incorporates popular features common to iMessage, has any convincing reason for Apple to sign on. That’s likely why Google is creating a little peer pressure of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6U1Fmm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Let’s chat about RCS","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"},{"title":"The moral case for iMessage on Android","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"},{"title":"Why I turned on iMessage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nMgnBN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has asked Apple if it intends to support RCS &lt;em&gt;literally years &lt;/em&gt;with no comment&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re not holding our breath. We’ve also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"&gt;the moral case&lt;/a&gt; that a company that claims privacy is a human right has a duty to bring encrypted messaging to the world, not just its own customers, and we’ve written about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"&gt;the personal plight of dealing with Apple’s inaction&lt;/a&gt;. (And when I say “we”, I mean Dieter, because RCS is his jam, I’m writing this post because he’s on vacation, and Dieter srsly why are you reading these words, aren’t you supposed to be on a socially distanced beach somewhere?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvKptQ"&gt;But maybe now that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22828277/apple-3-trillion-market-cap-company-earnings"&gt;is basically a three-trillion dollar company&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s under loads of regulatory scrutiny, and its dirty laundry (in the form of emails) has been aired in front of the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic"&gt;its employees are speaking out&lt;/a&gt;, and pieces like the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; are coming out, and its CEO Tim Cook is likely looking for a legacy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;larger than simply scaling up the company&lt;/a&gt; to become the most valuable in the world with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871202/tim-cook-2021-pay-package-compensation-proxy"&gt;a fat pay package&lt;/a&gt; as the reward... perhaps bringing iMessage to Android or RCS to iMessage is the kind of small concession that Apple might actually make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrmWgg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 7:48PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Dieter informs me Apple did actually reply to our requests for comment on RCS. Their reply was “No comment.” I regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is the latest popular app to bail on the Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tO0RhQCW8p8IiZWXBtxzHJEPm4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371662/DSCF7013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XGd3fO"&gt;Uber has quietly shut down its Apple Watch app, with the software now showing a message that instructs people to “please switch to the Uber mobile app.” The company is “no longer supporting the Apple Watch app,” according to the text, which ends with Uber apologizing for any inconvenience caused by the app’s discontinuation. There’s also a sad face emoji to drive that sentiment home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJRJLv"&gt;As noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/uber-apple-watch-app-discontinued/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Uber hasn’t yet removed the Apple Watch app from its &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uber-request-a-ride/id368677368"&gt;App Store listing&lt;/a&gt;, where it still gets its own tab and screenshots. Presumably, that will all be history once the company releases its next update to the iOS app. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Uber for more details, and if I had to guess, the company is likely to cite low usage as the main reason for its Apple Watch exit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HdCfqjmn-JlpSN4rJ-ePN6taq4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159195/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.42.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Uber&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uber’s Apple Watch app offered basic ride-hailing functionality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scOYWz"&gt;On the one hand, this is another example of smartwatches continuing to shed apps — even those that are massively popular and borderline essential on a phone — that aren’t core to their purpose(s) of fitness tracking, notifications, music playback, and so on. I’ve long had Uber installed on my Apple Watch, and I don’t think there was a single occasion where I hailed a ride from my wrist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys7XYG"&gt;Uber ended support for its WearOS app more than two years ago, so it’s not like Google’s platform fared much better with user engagement. Lyft has been out of this game since 2018. Perhaps it’s a case where the form factor just isn’t the right match for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48SE9i"&gt;The Apple Watch app provided barebones ride-hailing functionality, with more advanced options like splitting fares and sharing an ETA reserved for the full mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jT3X_bQX7t5a0-1eIimEZhvSoS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159213/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.47.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has previously highlighted Uber for the Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gcFfKc"&gt;But it also goes to show that, in some ways, smartwatches are only moving further away from being able to serve as a standalone smartphone fill-in — even temporarily. Maybe barely anyone took advantage of Uber on the Apple Watch, but the fact that it no longer exists on the platform at all feels notable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfDX8y"&gt;Want to leave your phone at home for the day and rely on your cellular Apple Watch? You can’t hail an Uber in that scenario anymore. And it’s a use case that Apple itself once highlighted, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIWlc8"&gt;Uber continues to offer its primary app for iPhone and a larger version for the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wrZNHQuybPnb7flbGQn29kCJWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371019/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4MqeMB"&gt;App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion since the store launched in 2008, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-services-enrich-peoples-lives-throughout-the-year/"&gt;according to a Monday press release from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-services-entertain-inform-and-connect-the-world-in-unprecedented-year/"&gt;last January&lt;/a&gt; that developers had earned more than $200 billion since the launch of the App Store, so the new figure shared Monday indicates developers earned $60 billion in 2021. The iPhone maker also said that spending on the App Store between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve in 2021 grew by a double-digit amount, though it didn’t specify exactly what that number might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yzhint"&gt;While the new numbers suggest that the App Store continues to be a big moneymaker, developer unhappiness with the store is high at the current moment. Many developers have taken issue with what they see as restrictive store policies, particularly the 30 percent cut Apple takes from many transactions. Apple is still embroiled in a legal dispute with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games over the App Store, and although Apple arguably got off well from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ruling&lt;/a&gt;, that ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;has been put on hold&lt;/a&gt;, meaning Apple won’t have to let developers point customers to alternative payment systems outside the App Store for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="758qDc"&gt;Monday’s press release also included a stat first shared &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/10/31/apple-q4-2021-financials-apple-music-paying-subs/"&gt;during its October earnings&lt;/a&gt;: there are more than 745 million paid subscriptions to services from developers and Apple. In recent years, Apple has added new premium services like News Plus, Fitness Plus, and Apple TV Plus to its roster of services offerings. The strategy seems to be paying off, given the new all-time high for services revenue reported during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;October earnings&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear how many subscriptions to Apple’s own services are counted in that 745 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAfjsi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, January 10th, 6:19PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The 745 million paid subscriptions to services includes subscriptions to both developers and Apple, not just Apple, as we originally reported. That number was also shared in its October earnings, not first on Monday as we said. We regret the errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
