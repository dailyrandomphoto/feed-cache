    <title>Apple Arcade just got a huge update of new games, including some mobile classics</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1avaZy"&gt;Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362624/fantasian-release-date-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;the latest release from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which is joined by other titles like new versions of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Oregon Trail&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; World of Demons &lt;/em&gt;from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehBqNs"&gt;For the greats, Apple is adding a number of high-profile mobile hits to the service, including &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mini Metro&lt;/em&gt;, and a remaster of &lt;em&gt;Cut the Rope&lt;/em&gt;. Timeless classics, meanwhile, refers to iconic games like backgammon, solitaire, and Zach Gage’s recent takes on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13262994/really-bad-chess-zach-gage-iphone-ipad"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334116/good-sudoku-iphone-ipad-app-game-zach-gage"&gt;sudoku&lt;/a&gt;. While most Arcade games are playable across Apple TV, Mac, and iOS, these new categories will only work on iPhone and iPad. The update adds more than 30 titles to the service, bringing the entire library to more than 180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYldDU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20870146/apple-arcade-launch-best-top-games-iphone-ipad-apple-tv"&gt;Apple Arcade first launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman"&gt;a new option for premium games&lt;/a&gt; on a platform that had become dominated by free-to-play experiences. The original pitch was a service full of new, largely exclusive games from developers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt; and a number of indie stalwarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4Th5X"&gt;However, despite the quality games and relative low price (an Arcade subscription is $4.99 per month), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308657/apple-arcade-canceling-games-subscription-service-engagement"&gt;Apple is reportedly not happy&lt;/a&gt; with the amount of engagement games are getting, which may be a reason behind this most recent shift in direction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple knew it was selling defective MacBook displays, judge concludes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Flexgate issue causes the display’s backlight to malfunction, dimming at regular intervals near the bottom of the screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0BIfEdVZzmkrPxXolKisYVu6Gs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064097/flexgate_vladsavov1__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DAzbE4"&gt;When Apple introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13548052/the-macbook-pro-lie"&gt;controversial MacBook Pro redesign&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, the company probably didn’t know it was setting itself up to get sued — but not only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344397/apple-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-switches-defective-class-action-lawsuit-certified"&gt;is a class-action lawsuit now underway&lt;/a&gt; for their infamous butterfly keyboards, it’s looking likely there’ll be a second one for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251264/macbook-pro-2018-flexgate-fix-display-cable-2mm-longer"&gt;their notoriously fragile display cables&lt;/a&gt;, too. Judge Edward Davila has decided to let the “flexgate” lawsuit go forward, ruling that Apple should have known that they would fail and yet kept selling them anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGd5Oh"&gt;“The court finds that the allegations of pre-release testing in combination with the allegations of substantial customer complaints are sufficient to show that Apple had exclusive knowledge of the alleged defect,” the judge wrote (via &lt;a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_161732083860310&amp;amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;amp;libId=kmzhlj98010023dg000DLcw7ilyuh&amp;amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F04%2F01%2Fdefective-macs-stage-light%2F&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.law360.com%2Farticles%2F1370714%2Fapple-must-face-trimmed-defective-laptop-display-suit&amp;amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.asana.com%2F&amp;amp;title=Defective%20Macs%20%27knowingly%20sold%20by%20Apple%27%20in%20stage%20light%20case%20-%209to5Mac&amp;amp;txt=Law360"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Law360&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/01/defective-macs-stage-light/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). You can read the full order at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xokUox"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Also known as stage light&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsXos0"&gt;To see what the issue looked like, just take a peek at our picture atop this post; it’s sometimes called the “stage light” issue because of how the cable damage would produce those dark spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kQg0j"&gt;Part of the flexgate controversy is around how Apple addressed the issue when it first got publicity in late 2018 — first by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251264/macbook-pro-2018-flexgate-fix-display-cable-2mm-longer"&gt;silently swapping a new, slightly longer cable&lt;/a&gt; into newer MacBooks, and only opening up one of its typical &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634438/flexgate-repair-program-macbook-pro-apple-announced"&gt;free repair programs&lt;/a&gt; months after 15,000 users signed a petition and it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18271733/flexgate-display-problem-macbook-pro-apple"&gt;called out in the press&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s been a lot more responsive with issues ever since, such as with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275582/apple-free-replacement-program-macbook-pro-batteries-2016-2017-one-percent"&gt;this free battery replacement program&lt;/a&gt; for a small number of those 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro laptops that won’t charge anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPhNBv"&gt;Unlike the butterfly keyboard suit, the flexgate one doesn’t appear to be a certified class-action lawsuit yet — but there are now nine different plaintiffs lined up in this single case, and the judge is inviting them to submit a new amended complaint. We’ll be watching to see where it goes from there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s H-1B visa freeze is over</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="American Conservative Union Holds Annual Conference In Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jr4QIiF5bYCA9st8ypuNWxUAZ0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064073/1304610267.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhGpRs"&gt;Former President Donald Trump’s ban on guest worker visas has expired, allowing foreign workers to reapply for entry into the United States. The news is a win for tech companies including Apple, Twitter, and Google, each of which vocally opposed the policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SZewo"&gt;Former President Donald Trump said the ban was a response to rising unemployment in the United States, due to the coronavirus pandemic. On the campaign trail, Joe Biden pushed back on this claim, calling it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1275430918946263041"&gt;an attempt to distract from the Trump Administration’s failure on the virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQ0KB6"&gt;The ban focused on H-1B visas, but impacted a broader range of workers, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/01/983579103/biden-allows-trumps-freeze-on-skilled-worker-and-other-visas-to-expire?utm_term=nprnews&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=npr"&gt;NPR reports&lt;/a&gt;. Executives at big corporations and students participating in work-study programs were also caught up in the fray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r59ye1"&gt;Workers already in the United States also had their lives upended. In June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21306188/guest-worker-ban-trump-h1b-visa-immigration-stamp-entry"&gt;an Egyptian tech worker in the Bay Area told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he’d planned to go back to Egypt for his brother’s wedding, but now couldn’t leave the country. “I feel like I’m selectively imprisoned,” he said. “If someone from my family gets sick, I can’t go back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1CfwqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The human cost of Trump’s guest worker ban","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21306188/guest-worker-ban-trump-h1b-visa-immigration-stamp-entry"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5OzA7d"&gt;In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300573/h1b-visa-ban-tim-cook-twitter-donald-trump-statement"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was&lt;/a&gt; “deeply disappointed” by the ban. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1275192967658119169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1275192967658119169%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F6%2F23%2F21300573%2Fh1b-visa-ban-tim-cook-twitter-donald-trump-statement"&gt;Twitter said it undermined&lt;/a&gt; “America’s greatest economic asset: its diversity.” Both companies rely on H-1B visas to hire foreign workers without going through the traditional immigration process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lek4YZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like Apple, this nation of immigrants has always found strength in our diversity, and hope in the enduring promise of the American Dream. There is no new prosperity without both. Deeply disappointed by this proclamation.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1275407136256712707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2OW0mH"&gt;In an announcement on April 1st, the state department &lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/update-on-presidential-proclamation-10052.html"&gt;said workers who were refused visas&lt;/a&gt; due to Trump’s restrictions will now have to submit new applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsttZi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7lGGF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest you can grab a pair right now is for $199 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $34 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has knocked $30 off this model’s retail price as well, bringing it down to $174. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is $289 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with 32GB of storage for $299 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $395&lt;/a&gt; in select colors, which is $29 off its usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted in all color variants at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $679, which is $70 off its usual price of $749. Walmart has a sale on the iPad Air 256GB for as low as $699 if you buy it in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Sky-Blue%2F483096080%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $948&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage.

    <title>Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad is $100 off at several retailers again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WjLpl9wmBHdz4PMZoSdR2Eboc-E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059965/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUYgym"&gt;With the right keyboard, you can turn your iPad into a functional laptop (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229046/ipados-ipad-magic-keyboard-software-limitations-trackpad-html-inspect-source"&gt;sort of&lt;/a&gt;). If you have been eyeing Apple’s Magic Keyboard but are waiting for a sale, today’s the day. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Generation/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMagic-Keyboard-for-iPad-Air-4th-generation-and-iPad-Pro-11-inch%2F984505060&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDailyDeals04012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; currently have the Magic Keyboard designed for the 11-inch iPad Pro and fourth-gen iPad Air available for $199, $100 off its regular price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRPUiq"&gt;If you own the 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, don’t worry: you can buy the accessory at a discounted price, too. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736540284080851936#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has knocked $100 off the Magic Keyboard designed for this specific iPad, bringing the price down to just $249. Both Magic Keyboards include a set of backlit keys and a trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MbM10N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0fWiuI"&gt;Despite being three years old, the first-generation Microsoft Surface Headphones are still a good option for those looking for a pair of reasonably priced noise-canceling headphones. Usually $250, Woot is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://computers.woot.com/offers/microsoft-surface-headphones-8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling them for $106&lt;/a&gt;, making them one of the best values in noise-canceling headphones available right now. If you order the Surface headphones through the Woot app, you’ll receive an additional 10 percent off your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kYLPHg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10373885"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="paJ861"&gt;Logitech’s G502 gaming mouse is one of the best on the market. Aside from the wired model being my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244488/gaming-gear-recommendations-favorite-nintendo-logitech-microsoft"&gt;personal favorite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572162/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-writer-gamer-logitech-asus"&gt;primary computer mouse&lt;/a&gt;, my colleague Cameron Faulkner thinks both versions of the G502 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;some of the best gaming mice you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can get the wireless variant, the G502 Lightspeed, for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$118 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get it for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flogitech-910-005565-g502-usb-lightspeed-wireless%2Fp%2FN82E16826197336%3FDescription%3DLogitech%2520G502%26cm_re%3DLogitech_G502-_-26-197-336-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119 at Newegg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726260149769003399#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$120 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="htmnOS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P8cmk9"&gt;If you are in the market for a new laptop but were not interested in the MacBook Air deal we covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/3/30/22358166/amazon-kindle-oasis-beats-headphones-apple-macbook-air-m1-deal-sale"&gt;the other day&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has discounted both storage configurations of the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.

Both laptops include 8GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple forced to offer Russian iPhone users local apps at setup thanks to new law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KZkFJaQkba3BLqSfK6QLRtsj_sw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059430/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eRTAWg"&gt;iPhones purchased in Russia now show a list of Russian-made apps at startup, thanks to a new law which comes into effect today, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/iphone-setup-russia-government-approved-apps/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The prompt is part of the standard iPhone setup process, appearing after the user has selected other options like whether to allow Location Services or App Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FC5mg"&gt;“In compliance with Russian legal requirements, continue to view available apps to download,” the dry text reads, before showing a short list of just shy of a dozen apps. These include various Yandex apps, an email app from Mail.ru, a video live streaming service called OK Live, and popular Russian social network VK. A “Get” icon appears next to each app, giving the user a shortcut to install them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="du1KVB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is how it looks in the actual setup. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QOUwwIGSnx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QOUwwIGSnx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Khaos Tian (@KhaosT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KhaosT/status/1377476353633624070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rUaQhd"&gt;The prompt comes in response to a Russian law that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;originally passed back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; requiring manufacturers to pre-install Russian-made software on devices sold in the country. It covers smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, laptops, and desktop computers. According &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-technology-software/russian-law-requires-smart-devices-to-come-pre-installed-with-domestic-software-idUSKBN2BO4P2?il=0"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the law is part of a broader attempt by Moscow to reduce its dependence on foreign companies as well as gain more control over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcv9fv"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334641/apple-follows-russian-default-apps-law-setup-screen-options-user"&gt;Apple agreed to comply with the law&lt;/a&gt; by giving users the option to install Russian-made apps at startup. It’s a notable concession from the company, which typically maintains tight control over the setup process of its devices. However, Apple has been willing to make changes in apparent attempts to comply with Russia’s local laws in the past, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985762/apple-maps-weather-apps-crimea-russia-territory"&gt;changing maps&lt;/a&gt; to show Crimea as Russian territory and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17803638/apple-watch-pride-face-russia-block"&gt;removing a gay pride watch face&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaWGyK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes that the big beneficiaries of the new law look set to be Yandex and Mail.ru. But in a statement last month a Russian official said that alternative apps will be included if they prove popular with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lqbpt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kG06a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will use Tesla’s ‘megapack’ batteries at its California solar farm </title>

  &lt;p id="IK7GvX"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapple-powers-ahead-in-new-renewable-energy-solutions-with-over-110-suppliers%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360839%2Fapple-tesla-megapack-energy-storage-grid-solar-batteries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced Wednesday that it’s building a big battery storage project&lt;/a&gt; at a Northern California solar farm it spearhead in 2015. But what the company didn’t share is that the battery packs will come from Tesla, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ym0hqc"&gt;The newly-announced setup, which will store up to 240 megawatt-hours of energy, was approved by the Monterey County Board of Supervisors in 2020, according to &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412130/Attachment_C___Applicant_s_Narrative_of_Project.pdf"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412167/Item_No__4_.pdf"&gt;submitted&lt;/a&gt; last &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412129/Item_No__3_.pdf"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;. It will consist of 85 Tesla lithium-ion “megapacks” and be used to help power the company’s corporate headquarters in Cupertino. Monterey County’s planning chief confirmed that Apple will use the Tesla batteries in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple declined to comment. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kbMZB"&gt;Tesla first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/20746170/tesla-megapack-battery-pge-storage-announced"&gt;the megapack battery system back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The 60MW storage setup Apple will be using is not Tesla’s biggest, though. The company has built bigger overall battery &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18715585/tesla-australia-renewable-energy-houses-electrical-grid-battery-installation"&gt;storage solutions in Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-08/tesla-is-plugging-a-secret-mega-battery-into-the-texas-grid"&gt;south of Houston, Texas&lt;/a&gt; of around 100MW in size. Still, Apple touted it as “one of the largest battery projects in the country” in a press release, saying the battery system could power more than 7,000 homes for a whole day. The Tesla batteries will make it possible for Apple to store energy generated by its 130-megawatt solar array at the farm, which is called &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/11558876/apple-to-build-848-million-solar-farm"&gt;California Flats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qFN9Id"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The project was quietly approved last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nPgoN5"&gt;“The challenge with clean energy — solar and wind — is that it’s by definition intermittent,” Apple VP Lisa Jackson &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-environment-idUSKBN2BN206"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “If we can do it, and we can show that it works for us, it takes away the concerns about intermittency and it helps the grid in terms of stabilization. It’s something that can be imitated or built upon by other companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfKT0C"&gt;While Apple uses lithium-ion batteries in many of its products, it’s not known to be working on any grid-scale projects. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY"&gt;reportedly developing a lithium iron phosphate battery for its electric car project&lt;/a&gt;, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kl9B7F"&gt;Apple and Tesla don’t have much overlapping history, though each company is notorious for poaching talent from the other. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also said in December that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;he tried to pitch the idea of Apple buying his company back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but that Apple CEO Tim Cook “refused” to take the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1s3G2X"&gt;Tesla is best known for its electric cars, but it’s spent years trying to build up an energy storage business to compliment the solar products it acquired when it bought Solar City. It has gotten increasingly involved in large-scale energy storage projects like Apple’s over the years in addition to its home battery business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHVpjw"&gt;While it’s still modest compared to the billions of dollars generated by Tesla’s car business, the energy storage division’s products has already netted at least one other strange bedfellow customer: in 2019, Volkswagen announced it was using Tesla batteries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18210439/volkswagen-tesla-battery-packs-ev-charging-station"&gt;at some of its Electrify America charging stations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
