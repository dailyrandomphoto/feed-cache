    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $850.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release later this year — and we’ll highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5M7S6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $850. The $1,249 512GB configuration is also on sale in all three colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,100, its best price to date. These deals can come and go quickly, though, we expect more to come as the holiday shopping season draws near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The touch bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s geared more toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $120 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,179. The larger, 512GB variant is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $1,349, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjmE4B"&gt;While there have been rumors throughout the year of a r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/9/22526584/apple-m1x-macbook-pro-wwdc-2021-youtube-tags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;edesigned MacBook Pro, one with an M1X processor and additional ports&lt;/a&gt;, we might not see it until further into the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch, mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Windows bootcamp-ready Ice Lake processors, the current scissor-switch keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in several configurations at Amazon, including one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th-gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999 and one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th-gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,700, which is $300 off the list price. You can also pick up the model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage and a 10th-gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; for $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. There are several configurations available with more storage and speedier processors — you can also get the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FTNGNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,695 at Amaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, for instance — but deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $799&lt;/a&gt;. B&amp;amp;H Photo is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;matching Amazon’s current price&lt;/a&gt; for the 512GB model, though, no other retailers are at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fu32v"&gt;Apple released iOS 15.0.2 on Monday, and it has some important bug fixes, including a couple specific to Find My. On my iPhone 12 Mini, the update clocks in at 531.1MB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8yv5S"&gt;Here are the patch notes from Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FopdTk"&gt;This update includes bug fixes for your iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="bMpUfp"&gt;AirTag might not appear in the Find My Items tab&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="J3QrME"&gt;iPadOS 15.0.2 is also out. Here’s what’s included in that, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/11/ios-15-0-2-release-bug-fixes-features/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Apple is also testing iOS 15.1 in beta, which currently includes features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686897/ios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card"&gt;SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, support for adding a COVID-19 vaccination card to Apple Wallet, and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713135/iphone-13-camera-features-prores-macro-ios-15-1-beta-3"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro camera features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is appealing the Epic Games ruling it originally called a ‘resounding victory’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rw1L-2fRK2yD6eV4lSRtlNc_Ofs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69972129/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple is appealing the Epic Games ruling | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HXBaCg"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;potentially billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; and some control over the App Store at stake, Apple has filed for an appeal of the ruling in its major trial against Epic. While Apple largely won that case (the company went so far as to call the ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling"&gt;a “resounding victory”&lt;/a&gt;) with Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruling in favor of Apple in nine of the ten claims Epic brought against the company, it did lose in one important way: the judge found that Apple violated California’s anti-steering rules, and demanded that Apple let developers link to outside payment systems. That policy would have taken over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, but it may be pushed out beyond that — and it seems that’s the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzMH0j"&gt;As part of the appeal, Apple is asking for a stay to prevent the company from having to implement the new anti-steering rules, arguing that it “will allow Apple to protect consumers and safeguard its platform while the company works through the complex and rapidly evolving legal, technological, and economic issues.” And the company’s arguments there are pretty revealing if we’re reading the document right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yxijeu"&gt;For instance, Apple claims that the new anti-steering rule is unnecessary because the company had already agreed to delete the offending section of its App Store Guidelines in the &lt;em&gt;Cameron v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;settlement, but that’s news to us: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt;, Apple only agreed to “clarify” that app developers were allowed to communicate with consenting customers, not link to outside payment systems. That clarification was widely seen by developers as a red herring. At the time, Apple didn’t say anything about deleting a section of its App Store Guidelines entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yPUaOe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple and Epic both lost today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling"},{"title":"The future of the App Store depends on the difference between a ‘button’ and an ‘external link’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"},{"title":"What comes next for the App Store?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671574/epic-apple-app-store-new-rules-meaning-ruling-decision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fPZLBZ"&gt;It also seems like Apple is genuinely afraid that the court order &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; force them to open up the App Store to alternate payment mechanisms, despite what some Apple pundits have claimed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;A button might actually be a button&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="32fHay"&gt;Links and buttons to alternate payment mechanisms are fraught with risk. Users who click on a payment link embedded in an app—particularly one distributed through the curated App Store—will expect to be led to a webpage where they can securely provide their payment information, email address, or other personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2k0SHS"&gt;Apple goes on to argue that if it were forced to allow app developers to link to external payment systems, it wouldn’t be able to protect users from fraud: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="07eXrO"&gt;While Apple could examine the links in the version of the app submitted for review, there is nothing stopping a developer from changing the landing point for that link or altering the content of the destination webpage. Additionally, Apple currently has no ability to determine whether a user who clicks on an external link actually received the products or features she paid for. Apple already receives hundreds of thousands of reports each day from users, and allowing links to external payment options would only increase this burden. In essence, the introduction of external payment links, particularly without sufficient time to test and evaluate the security implications, will lead to the very same security concerns that Apple combats with the use of IAP more generally, which the Court agreed were legitimate, procompetitive reasons for the design of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9GgANe"&gt;There are a number of open questions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;about how well Apple protects App Store users&lt;/a&gt; — it was only this past week that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;added a feature to easily report obvious App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67W2hL"&gt;The company even cites a blog post from (and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s story about) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714677/apple-in-app-payment-competitor-paddle-epic-ruling"&gt;Paddle, a would-be rival to Apple’s in-app payments that emerged after the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt;, using it to illustrate one possible threat to consumers. Not because of its lower fees, of course, but because “In contrast to Apple’s strict rules surrounding privacy, that developer intends to provide access to user email addresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSOivG"&gt;Other arguments are raised as well, which you can read in full in the document embedded at the bottom of this post. Overall, the company says that the “precipitous implementation of this aspect of the injunction would upset the careful balance between developers and customers provided by the App Store, and would irreparably harm both Apple and consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCH4s7"&gt;Apple also cites a previous case, &lt;em&gt;Ohio v. AmEx&lt;/em&gt;, as evidence that transaction platforms like the App Store can promote competition despite steering restrictions. (AmEx doesn’t double as a software marketplace, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ay66qJ"&gt;It’s important to note that Apple has only filed for appeal; we don’t know if the court will grant the appeal — and the stay— just yet. When the ruling originally hit in in September, Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt; that it hadn’t decided whether to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xc5yqh"&gt;For its part, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"&gt;Epic announced its intent to appeal&lt;/a&gt; on the same day Judge Gonzalez Rogers issued her order and permanent injunction against Apple. It was clear from the beginning that Epic wasn’t happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nQVyH"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney issued his response to the appeal, and it’s pretty much what you’d expect: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wDiEtX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple filed a peel &lt;a href="https://t.co/hvnfgg8lZC"&gt;https://t.co/hvnfgg8lZC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TouBIrKiSp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TouBIrKiSp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1446627338058350599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>If you want to use the Apple Watch Series 7’s new fast charging, make sure to use the cable in the box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFzmi6Ppf8-Ek9wq06qiHdRiaw8=/74x0:820x497/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971643/Capto_Capture_2021_09_14_01_24_25_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KhEdj0"&gt;One of the best features on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; is its newly added fast charging system, which Apple claims is 33 percent and capable of charging the watch to about 80 percent charge in about 45 minutes. But if you want to take advantage of the fast charging, you’ll need to make sure to use the charger that comes with the Series 7, which is a brand new “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMLWJ3AM%2FA%2Fapple-watch-magnetic-fast-charger-to-usb-c-cable-1-m&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716294%2Fapple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-cable-magnetic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger&lt;/a&gt;” that’s different from the old model (which doesn’t offer similar charging speeds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQsaH0"&gt;The old USB-C charger and the new model look identical from the outside, but only the new cable can charge the Series 7 at full speed (assuming you’ve got a USB-C charger that can put out the proper wattage, that is — Apple recommends its own 20W USB-C charger, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6tihBM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Make sure to actually use the cable that comes with the Series 7&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wRBb8G"&gt;And while Apple has already stopped selling the old USB-C charger that doesn’t offer fast charging on its site, they’re still available from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Magnetic-Charger-USB-C/dp/B07XR9TYQ1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other retailers like Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll want to make sure you’re buying the right one if you’re looking to pick up a spare. It also means that if you own an existing Apple Watch charging dock or stand that has a built-in charger, you won’t be able to take advantage of the faster charging available on the Series 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lquMvi"&gt;Of course, none of this matters if you own an older Apple Watch: even if you’re using the proper fast charging cable, the fast charging technology still needs a Series 7 watch to work. As Apple’s website notes: “Fast charging is only compatible with Apple Watch Series 7. Other models will have regular charge times.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaNqWaV5j4cx0WB5BjSpqEwDxr4=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949627/Apple_watch_series7_availability_stainless_steel_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 features larger screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAQ6pp"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; Series 7 was announced alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s the final device of Apple’s new fall products to launch. This newer model sits atop Apple’s current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios if you want to pay for service with your carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMTfvS"&gt;After Apple’s initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;the new models are set to release on October 15th&lt;/a&gt;, and you can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder them now through Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKhcuwgnDQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640209%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fapple-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_6549129&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LuD92a"&gt;What’s new&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="roSEq8"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 prominently features that new, larger display that stretches the screen closer to the edges for a more full-bleed aesthetic and showing more actionable information at once. It has a slight curve at its farthest edges, though Apple says the watch is overall more durable thanks to a 50 percent thicker glass cover and IP6X rating for better dirt and sand resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RLkrZ"&gt;New watch faces exclusive to the Series 7 promise to put that extra screen real estate to work, while the watch maintains a physical footprint that is close to its predecessor. Apple has also improved charging speeds, including a new USB-C wireless magnetic fast charger with the watch that it claims will offer up to a 33 percent quicker charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lttaJ7"&gt;On the software side, the Apple Watch Series 7 runs watchOS 8, supports a full swiping keyboard for text input, is compatible with new workouts, and maintains all the health-tracking features found on prior iterations: sleep tracking, heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and fall detection that now registers during workouts. There is plenty to take advantage of if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch and prefer to have Apple’s latest and greatest iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LxippD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"},{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0ZdgqF"&gt;The aluminum-encased Series 7 watches come in midnight, starlight, an updated blue, (PRODUCT) RED, and a new dark green colorway, so there is a bit to choose from whether you’re going for a discreet, bold, or rugged look. Let’s break down all that there is to offer here before we dive further into specific configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FWKvlA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10743503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 in midnight, starlight, green, blue, and PRODUCT (RED).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ixNYqI"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yBbMqA"&gt;You can preorder your preferred configuration directly from Apple or a variety of retailers right now, with the earliest orders shipping on October 15th. The main options for you to decide on, aside from your preferred color, are size and connectivity. The base Apple Watch Series 7 configuration is a 41mm, GPS-only model that retails for $399. The 41mm version with a cellular connection runs $100 more at $499. If you have a larger wrist or prefer bigger screens, the 45mm GPS-only model is $429, while its cellular-equipped counterpart climbs up to $529. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CYcjeM"&gt;Preorder all sizes, colors, and configurations at Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ybj2aF"&gt;If you want an Apple Watch with your pick of the litter for bands — standard, premium, or fixed-length — then Apple has the most on offer. It’s the only place you can order an Apple Watch with custom-sized solo loop straps, though be sure to use the size guide. Shipments are initially expected for October 15th, however, select models won’t ship until early to mid-November. If you opt for in-store pickup at an Apple Store, it might still be the 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iin96H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1oQQDo"&gt;Preorder at Best Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UewUYo"&gt;Best Buy’s site is indicating that the base 41mm GPS model will arrive on release day, while some other configurations with cellular connectivity are to be expected around October 25th. The retailer has all colors available for the size and connectivity of your choice, each with a matching sport band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6zF2jz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="r0rafV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qmXurY"&gt;Preorder at Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5PezQJ"&gt;Walmart has a variety of anticipated shipping dates for preorders. All preorders are expected to ship by October 15th, though, some individual configurations have delivery dates ranging from the 15th to the 21st. Oddly, the red, 45mm LTE model notes a shipping date of October 11th, though we would advise not putting too much confidence in its accuracy. There can sometimes be errors in retailer listings as soon as a product is put up for sale, which is often corrected later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h4THAO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797290"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="5A8W7H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h2Dlds"&gt;Preorder at Target&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eWiJze"&gt;Target lists each and every color and configuration of the aluminum Apple Watch Series 7 as shipping by the release date of October 15th. This can always change on the fly, but it is worth considering if you want to get your new watch as quickly as possible. Target RedCard members will also receive free shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NR6Vib"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kSl7XQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797315"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uoprLg"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 from phone carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3dbtKG"&gt;Most major phone carriers in the US offer the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 for preorder, which can help if you prefer to purchase the smartwatch on a monthly installment plan that you might already have for your phone. For the cellular models, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11557999?sid=VergeAppleWatchSeries7100821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13761603?sid=VergeAppleWatchSeries7100821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fapple-watch-series-7-41mm-green-aluminum-clover-sport.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7-41mm%3Fsku%3D194252566381&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; all offer the Series 7 in each of its sizes and colors at the same starting price as Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxgiN"&gt;Apple has confirmed that when you &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Faluminum-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 through its own store&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-14498937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint / T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, you will get $100 back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g50QyqEKJq0rPdmM51JUYxdmD-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900357/Apple_watch_series7_availability_hermes_10052021.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VH7yJz"&gt;More premium case options and custom configurator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T46tsH"&gt;Apple has also offered the latest top-end watch in additional case materials for years. This generation is no different, with the Series 7 available in &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Fstainless-steel-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stainless steel starting at $699&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Ftitanium-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;titanium starting at $799&lt;/a&gt;, as well as band options from luxury fashion boutique Hermès. The easiest way to preorder these is directly from Apple, as it carries the most options and not all retailers sell the more luxurious watches — though &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKhlKGfOGa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-stainless-steel-series-7-gps-cellular%2F-%2FA-84783483%3Fpreselect%3D77640146%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fapple-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_6549129%3Fsort%3Dprice_high&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; do have some stainless steel models available for preorder. Most people opt for aluminum, which offers the same functionality at a lower price, but the premium models have a unique fit and finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR4t55"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fstudio%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s own online boutique for creating exact custom Apple Watch configurations, makes a return for the Series 7. If you prefer an Apple Watch in a particular combination of size, finish, color, and band, you can make your selection and pay the configured price directly from Apple. This is the only way to order one of the popular solo loop straps with your Apple Watch, as those fixed-length straps are only sold through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This iPhone 13 case adds what the phone was always missing — a candy launcher</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZvQwDjQwcpWnaum9SmBD2GhMXhc=/213x0:2130x1278/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970698/Screen_Shot_2021_10_08_at_10.34.53_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vOXkPc"&gt;No matter how much Apple hypes Ceramic Shield — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509008/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-mini-displays-ceramic-hardened"&gt;the special glass mixture introduced with the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; — and the build quality of the metal and glass sandwich that is the modern iPhone, expensive phones need cases. Maybe you ordered one alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;your new iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, but if you didn’t, may I propose an exciting and undeniably useful option — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX46nzE9wmw"&gt;a giant case that rockets hard candy&lt;/a&gt; into your mouth (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-perfect-iphone-13-case-holds-a-bunch-of-candy-and-s-1847825950"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTtUK1"&gt;YouTube creator and inventor Matty Benedetto is responsible for the DIY case, which he calls the Candy Catapult. It’s 3D printed from flexible TPU filament with a hard candy container back for your poison of choice, be it M&amp;amp;Ms, Skittles, or Reese Pieces (only sickos would mix all three). To actually launch the candy out of the case, Benedetto added a pinball machine-esque spring-loaded plunger. It’s hard to gauge just how hard it launches its little sugary missiles, but it definitely seems strong enough to send a piece of candy clear across the room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDDmDGco2eD9u6gy6eIIBJQCbAI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910798/gif__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Candy Catapult works!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g924kt"&gt;My first thought watching Benedetto’s video is not relief that I suddenly have a way to dispense with my industrial-sized bag of lozenges (no help needed there) but really excitement over the other possible things one could launch from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kyZmu"&gt;I’m really just wondering how quickly this becomes a weapon with metal ball bearings in it. Is it launching it hard enough to break a window if you were to swap candy with something more... damaging? Some things are perhaps best left unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removes the Apple Watch Series 6 from its official lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYWFlMkuzt0_wwbCBJd7o5Dp_Ag=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970023/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtqCI4"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 is finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available to preorder&lt;/a&gt;, nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple announced the new smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. But the launch of the Series 7 also brings the removal of the Series 6 from the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fwatch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F8%2F22716438%2Fapple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official Apple Watch lineup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHP2Nv"&gt;If you want to buy a brand new Apple Watch from Apple, you now only have three options: the Series 7, which starts at $399; the still-very-good SE, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; and starts at $279; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;years-old Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFwQ27"&gt;There are still a few ways to get a Series 6, though, and given how many features are shared &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-6-vs-apple-watch-series-7/"&gt;between the Series 7 and the Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, the previous generation model could be a good option to consider if you want to save some money. Apple’s refurbished store has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fwatch%2Fapple-watch-series-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F8%2F22716438%2Fapple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three different Series 6 models for sale right now&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and Amazon is currently offering many &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=apple+watch+series+6&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1"&gt;refurbished Series 6 watches at a discount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2020 iPad Air is down to its lowest price yet today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FMfAHQh2K8WDQuNngHf5Tjy41L0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69968651/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Keyboard is, unfortunately, sold separately.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lp7Lmo"&gt;Apple’s fourth-generation iPad Air with a refreshed design and USB-C charging instead of Lightning &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is down to its best price yet at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can get the 64GB Wi-Fi model in the color of your choosing for $489 — $10 less than the starting price &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;for the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; that has a similar design. For the price, you’re getting a far bigger tablet. If you’ve been in the market for a high-end iPad but don’t want to put down iPad Pro-levels of cash, this could be exactly what you’re after. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0lw7Hg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YtW7Pt"&gt;For the first time since launching earlier this year, the navy-colored Apple AirTag Loop is &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/0Jjn2V"&gt;selling for $19 instead of its typical $29&lt;/a&gt; at Adorama. The simple, polyurethane loop allows you to add your AirTag — which lacks a lanyard hole — to accessories like your backpack, keychain, and luggage. Although there are often more affordable third-party loops available, this is a rare deal Apple fans may find worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tj5Kpn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795285"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3r70zX"&gt;If you’re in the market for a competent laptop, Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091WY8D1C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $849&lt;/a&gt;, a $250 discount. Equipped with 512GB of storage and Intel’s 11th Gen Core i5 processor, the 15.6-inch laptop normally goes for $1,100. In addition to offering an AMOLED display and 20 hours of battery life, the lightweight Windows machine also comes with Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, a Thunderbolt 4 port, and Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics. Those deeply embedded in the Samsung ecosystem might also enjoy how you can easily pair the clamshell laptop with Samsung’s line of Galaxy Buds and quickly share files across Galaxy devices with Quick Share. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our hands-on impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GhiBux"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QP1QmY"&gt;Apple owners planning on traveling this upcoming holiday season may be interested in this rare discount on the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2FVerge%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fvergedailydeals092321%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-qi%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple MagSafe Duo Charger&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $129, Verizon is currently selling the charger — which you can fold to make smaller and thus more portable — for $97, one of its lowest prices to date. With the wireless charging station, you can charge MagSafe-compatible iPhone 12 and 13 models, as well as the Apple Watch, select AirPods models, and various Qi-certified devices. Note, however, that in order to fast-charge your iPhone, you’ll need at least a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20W power brick&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow for charging speeds of up to 11W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7S41gC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="frrWKi"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgopro-hero9-black-waterproof-action-camera-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero9&lt;/a&gt;, the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;biggest, baddest action camera out there&lt;/a&gt;,” is $70 cheaper today at Woot. Now until October 30th (or while supplies last), members can &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgopro-hero9-black-waterproof-action-camera-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pick up the popular action camera for $380&lt;/a&gt; instead of $450, with free shipping for Prime members. The GoPro Hero9 can capture 5K video at 60fps as well as 23MP stills, and it features a new processor and a removable lens. Just like the newer Hero10, it offers crisp footage along with a great front-facing screen and rugged build quality. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review"&gt;Hero10 review&lt;/a&gt;, the last-gen model is not too dissimilar from the more expensive Hero10 — that is, unless you need smooth, 5.3K 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fV9noY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10332746"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejat2B"&gt;Apple fans, we’ve got another deal you might love. If you’re open to a desktop computer, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5P7TLW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can save $100&lt;/a&gt; on the 512GB version of the 2020 Mac Mini, which comes with Apple’s new M1 chip. Regularly $899, the Mac Mini is on sale at Amazon for $799, its lowest price to date. After testing the Mac Mini, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; the device’s performance to be impressive and praised how well existing apps run on the M1 chip. We did, however, dislike the built-in speaker and the fact that the Mini only offers up to 16GB of unified memory. Note the 256GB configuration is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 cheaper today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, selling for $659.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l2cY7u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfid-3136639543"&gt;Apple products aren’t the only thing on sale today. In case you weren’t already aware, we’re coming up on our anniversary. That’s right, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is officially turning 10, and we’re throwing a party on October 22nd and 23rd in New York City in honor of the occasion. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702324/on-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators"&gt;On The Verge&lt;/a&gt; will feature exhibits, live performances, guests like the CEO and co-founder of Clubhouse, and so much more. Right now, you can purchase tickets for less than half the price, and grab them for $99 instead of $254. Each ticket comes with four complimentary drink tickets as well as entry for both days. To take advantage of the deal, you just need to register&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/evite"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and enter promo code &lt;strong&gt;$99NOW&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. Hope to see you there! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SVP of Android offers open invitation to help Apple put RCS texting on the iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The Samsung Electronics Co. Unpacked Product Launch Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eQL9Bb5kUymvqQoti8MsQwG4MQ=/0x3:3000x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967396/1200178032.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HlGXtY"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953"&gt;tweet earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, Google SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer called on Apple to support RCS, the next-generation texting standard that’s supposed to supplant SMS. He offered an “open invitation to the folks who can make this right” and said “we are here to help.” Translation: the “folks” are Apple and “we are here to help” is Google’s offer to assist Apple in implementing the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eefiaP"&gt;RCS is finally starting to gain traction around the world. Its biggest champion has been Google, which finally landed on using it as the default texting solution for Android phones after trying every other solution. RCS is far from perfect, but it’s clearly superior to SMS (which is, of course, a low bar). After securing deals from US carriers to commit to the standard in the next year, Google is setting its sights on a new target for evangelism: Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k633wL"&gt;Apple has yet to reply with comment to any inquiry from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over several years on whether it intends to support RCS on the iPhone, and declined to comment on this story. It seems unlikely that RCS is coming to iOS anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EXREhk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Group chats don't need to break this way. There exists a Really Clear Solution. Here's an open invitation to the folks who can make this right: we are here to help.    &lt;a href="https://t.co/4P6xfsQyT0"&gt;https://t.co/4P6xfsQyT0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60ao87"&gt;Lockheimer’s tweet followed a cheeky chain of tweets that started with a &lt;a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/bryson-dechambeau-iphone-ryder-cup-grouptext?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=golfdigest"&gt;story about how pro golfer Bryson DeChambeau was breaking iMessage group chats with his green bubbles&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Android/status/1446182495846912006"&gt;official Android account cringingly&lt;/a&gt; drawing a parallel between green bubbles and the &lt;a href="https://www.golfmonthly.com/tour/us-masters/masters-history-records/masters-green-jacket-126753"&gt;famous Masters green jacket&lt;/a&gt;. Lockheimer jokes that there is a “Really Clear Solution” (RCS) to group chats not breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKQVLi"&gt;RCS has had a long, convoluted (and unfinished) slog towards becoming the default texting experience on Android. Beginning in March 2021, Google began securing deals from US carriers to get them to commit to using Google’s Android Messages app as the default on all Android phones sold on their networks. It started with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;blockbuster deal with T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, followed later by smaller deals with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;. Once all those deals are implemented, Android users who text each other will switch over to RCS, which supports typing indicators, better group chats, and bigger multimedia messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SV52C7"&gt;Importantly, RCS on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;Android Messages also supports end-to-end encryption for one-on-one chats&lt;/a&gt;. That will mean Android users texting each other will have a higher level of privacy and security than when they text iPhone users — and vice versa. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713543/syniverse-hack-five-years-text-messages"&gt;recent hack on SMS company Syniverse&lt;/a&gt; is just the latest example of why encryption is important in messaging — especially for the default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwXfhp"&gt;RCS has problems of its own, though. As with iMessage, it’s possible for messages to get lost in limbo when switching phones. It’s also a standard that is championed by Google but theoretically agreed upon by carriers around the world. The association with Google has tainted RCS in the eyes of many, and of course requiring carriers to agree on anything is a recipe for problems. There are also technical limitations, as &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/7/"&gt;Ron Amadeo explains here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvu6A5"&gt;Nevertheless, it seems inevitable that RCS will replace SMS eventually — but only if Apple decides to support it. As more carriers adopt it and as more users realize that SMS is inherently less secure, Apple could begin to feel enough pressure to adopt RCS. Thus far, however, it hasn’t shown any signs of that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSVGtj"&gt;Ireland said Thursday it &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/59812-ireland-joins-oecd-international-tax-agreement/"&gt;would join an international agreement&lt;/a&gt; that sets taxes on profits for multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15 percent. This is a major shift for the country that is the European headquarters for many large US pharmaceutical companies, as well as tech firms, including Google, Apple, and Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QIsgP"&gt;An increase from Ireland’s current 12.5 percent to 15 percent may not seem that large by itself. The so-called Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework agreement, outlined in July, is actually a two-pillar plan aimed at helping end tax avoidance and making international tax rules fairer and more transparent. The OECD has &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/about/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that a 15 percent tax rate would generate some $150 billion in global tax revenue annually and would help to stabilize the international tax system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE36Ic"&gt;Ireland signed on to the deal ahead of a Friday meeting at the OECD among the 140 countries that have been negotiating its terms for several years. The plan calls for global companies to pay taxes in countries where their products or services are sold, even if they don’t have a physical presence there, and would apply to multinational companies with revenues above €750 million (about $867 million). For companies with revenues below €750 million, the 12.5 percent rate would remain in effect in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVeFW8"&gt;Over the past several decades, Ireland has served as a tax shelter for many large tech companies, thanks to its low corporate tax rate. Companies typically create Irish subsidiaries of their companies that license their intellectual property, on which the subsidiary pays royalties. Some 800 US companies have operations in Ireland, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.amcham.ie/"&gt;American Chamber of Commerce Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, employing about 180,000 people. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apples-cork-campus-celebrates-40-years-of-community-and-looks-to-the-future/"&gt;Apple opened its first plant in Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 and now employs some 6,000 people on its campus in the city of Cork. Facebook established its &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2008/10/facebook-to-establish-international-headquarters-in-dublin-ireland/"&gt;international headquarters in Dublin in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/13/business/technology-briefing-e-commerce-google-chooses-dublin-for-headquarters.html"&gt;Google announced its European headquarters&lt;/a&gt; would be in Ireland in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y34ICX"&gt;Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/speech/615f7-statement-by-minister-donohoe-on-decision-for-ireland-join-oecd-international-tax-agreement/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that the agreement will “address the tax challenges of digitalisation.” Donohoe added that he believes companies will still choose to locate their headquarters in Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34KCdt"&gt;“I am confident that Ireland will remain competitive into the future, and we will remain an attractive location and ‘best in class’ when multi-nationals look to investment locations,” Donohoe said. “These multinational enterprises support our economy with high value jobs, and at the same time, Ireland provides a stable platform and a long proven track record of success for MNEs choosing to invest here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKurZd"&gt;If the OECD agreement moves forward, its provisions are expected to take effect in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
