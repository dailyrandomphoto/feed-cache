    <title>Apple’s rumored AR/VR headset might rely on a nearby iPhone or Mac for processing </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJUD22"&gt;Apple’s rumored AR/VR headset is designed to rely on another device, and may have to offload more processor-heavy tasks to a connected iPhone or Mac, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-ar-vr-headset-will-need-connection-to-other-device-such-as-iphone"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is reportedly working on a custom chip for the headset, an SoC that’s intentionally missing capabilities found in Apple’s other processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX3luT"&gt;While the new chip reportedly doesn’t have Apple’s neural engine, which handles AI and machine learning, it’s reportedly designed to be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; at wirelessly sending and receiving data, and compressing/decompressing video than traditional chips, which makes sense if the headset is designed to stream data from another device rather than doing the heavy processing itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZFa7pg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A stripped-down SoC for augmented battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="difQ8f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say it’s designed to be as power-efficient as possible for maximum battery life, something that both removing unused parts of the chip and streaming data from another device might help with. For wearable technology, like a watch or set of glasses, there’s always been a delicate balance between battery life and performance/capability. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review"&gt;original Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; handed off many tasks to a connected iPhone, though Apple was eventually able to make its onboard processor powerful enough to handle many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq6vJ0"&gt;If the idea of Apple’s headset relying on a separate device sounds familiar, it might be because of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-19/apple-team-working-on-vr-and-ar-headset-and-ar-glasses?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;this 2020 &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, which mentioned that earlier versions of the headset were meant to work with a separate “stationary hub, which in prototype form resembled a small Mac,” until Jony Ive stepped in to say that it should be self-contained and Tim Cook sided with his design chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEF5Cc"&gt;Ive no longer works for Apple, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Apple’s going back to a bulky or stationary hub: &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reports the AR/VR headset still has its own CPU and GPU inside, and suggests it might be able to communicate with a phone or tablet or even work in a basic stand-alone mode. Some of Apple’s devices, like the Apple Watch, can still perform basic tasks in low battery mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H2Ab96"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Think big picture&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="suzp5N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the device will have an “unusually large” image sensor, as big as one of the headset’s lenses, which has apparently been difficult to manufacture. It hasn’t shown up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;in previous leaks&lt;/a&gt;, but the publication says it’s designed to “capture high-resolution image data from a user’s surroundings for AR”.  That might come in handy considering the headset is reportedly both an AR and VR device — since it’s difficult to do VR without completely obscuring the user’s view, and difficult to do AR without the user being able to see the outside world, the image sensor could be meant to provide a view of the user’s surroundings from inside the headset — similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590794/oculus-mixed-reality-api-quest-2-development-kit-unity"&gt;Oculus’ passthrough view&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps at higher quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRKW00"&gt;While rumors about Apple working on an augmented reality device have been around for years, the idea is still coming into focus. Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;has predicted&lt;/a&gt; that we’d see a “helmet-type” headset in 2022, but &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says that the custom chips for the headset won’t be ready for mass production for at least a year. If that’s correct, even the best-case scenario would be an extremely tight turnaround to get a product out the door by the end of 2022, though that might still be possible if the first version is aimed at developers or a very limited number of early adopters. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says that the sleeker glasses model could come out as soon as 2023, while Kuo predicts mid-2025. Unlike the “helmet-type” headset, the glasses device is rumored to be exclusively for AR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWxWOP"&gt;As for what the headset will actually do, Apple CEO Tim Cook has long enthused about AR and how it will “&lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/the-transcript-of-todays-opening-statement-from-apples-ceo-on-fiscal-q4-2017-is-now-available.html"&gt;transform the way you work, play, connect and learn&lt;/a&gt;,” and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX9xBB_vBsc&amp;amp;t=433s"&gt;let people have “enhanced” conversations&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, we don’t really have a clear picture of what kind of AR/VR features or interface the company wants to implement. Without that, it’s hard to guess whether the device having to offload processing onto something else is destined to be just a quirk of early models, or a design decision that will stick around for years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 may have new watchfaces to take advantage of bigger screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A new Apple Watch watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/myhnsQc4kRDXAiG6XP0LruvP6QE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810488/vpavic_200929_4216_0171.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yD9iC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/apple-s-bigger-watch-will-jam-more-data-than-ever-on-your-wrist?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;shared more details Thursday&lt;/a&gt; about what to expect from the rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;bigger screens&lt;/a&gt; coming to the next Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPk4uv"&gt;Gurman has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the next watch, which he says will be called the Apple Watch Series 7, will be offered in 41mm and 45mm screen sizes. In his new article, he reiterated those sizes and added that the larger model’s screen will measure 1.9 inches diagonally, up from 1.78 inches on the bigger Series 6, and offer about 16 percent more pixels with a resolution of 396 x 484, up from 368 x 448. Both Series 7 watches will also have thinner borders around their screens, Gurman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mfR9IH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is working on new watchfaces&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLmiPO"&gt;Apple is also working on new watchfaces. One, called Modular Max, will apparently show the time, one small complication, and then have larger complications that “span the length of the screen stacked on top of each other below,” Gurman says. Another, which Gurman says goes by the name of Atlas and World Timer internally at Apple, “will let a user see all 24 time zones simultaneously.” One, called Continuum, will “change based on the flow of time and the current hour.” Apple is also working on new watchfaces for its Apple Watches made in partnership with Hermes and Nike. Some of these may ship with the Series 7, according to Gurman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enV59t"&gt;As Gurman has said previously, he reiterated that the Series 7 will have a faster processor and a new case with flatter edges. However, production issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;reported Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; could mean the Series 7 is delayed or in short supply when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gBKZs"&gt;Apple plans to announce the new watches “as soon as this month,” Gurman says. That timeline would line up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21430844/apple-event-recap-biggest-announcements-watch-series-6-se-ipad-air"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20847477/new-apple-watch-series-5-2019-always-on-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will ask before it targets you with its ads in iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMkgnshIHy6fTOFw2REVRR-NYYE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69809320/acastro_170731_1777_0001_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O5vjBv"&gt;Apple will start asking for permission to enable Personalized Ads in iOS 15, the company’s method of serving relevant ads in the App Store and Apple News by analyzing what you read, purchase, and search for on your device (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/02/apple-personalized-ads-targeting-ios-15/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company used to collect that information by default, but now it plans to ask for permission. Apple required other developers to seek users’ permission with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;the debut of App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt;, so it seems like it’s showing that it will hold itself to a similar standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yf5qug"&gt;The Personalized Ads pop-up should show up when you open the App Store if you’re running the most recent iOS 15 beta. In the pop-up, Apple writes that the ads will help you discover relevant apps, products, and services while protecting your privacy by using “device-generated identifiers and not linking advertising information to your Apple ID.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XSUzobPS7GnLP3OmgCSJnTv6BM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822881/IMG_0003.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Personalized Ads pop-up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VznZjE"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223"&gt;Apple’s Advertising policy&lt;/a&gt;, the sources it draws from to target ads vary, but they can include your device information (including your location if you’ve granted permission), App Store searches and purchases, and news stories you read in Apple News. The company links to its policy and also lets you turn off personalized ads entirely in the Settings app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u07MXH"&gt;From one angle, this is one of the smallest gestures Apple could make toward treating itself the same way it treats developers — who all have to ask to track users of Apple’s products as part of the controversial App Tracking Transparency policy. As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; mentions, however, Apple’s closed-loop first-party ad targeting technically doesn’t fall under the purview of those restrictions, unlike developers’ apps that may share the information they collect with third parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xo8PjH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple’s rule for other developers: you have to ask users if they want to be “tracked” for ad targeting&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Apple’s own ad tracking is “personalization,” which sounds much less nefarious &lt;a href="https://t.co/hsAQuT8zYb"&gt;https://t.co/hsAQuT8zYb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Heath (@alexeheath) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1433460592619126785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8FYVTU"&gt;Apple’s language choice is worth examining, too, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1433460592619126785?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s senior reporter Alex Heath notes&lt;/a&gt;: developers are expected to ask a user if they consent to being tracked, while Apple is allowed to refer to what it’s doing as “personalization.” Those words don’t exactly have the same positive connotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCOhaS"&gt;This change might be better viewed as yet another minuscule concession — like recent changes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;to what developers are allowed to link to in-app&lt;/a&gt; — in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;the current antitrust scrutiny Apple faces&lt;/a&gt; and will likely deal with in the future. A little ad-tracking pop-up is a small piece of evidence to point to and say, “See, we’re trying to be fair” whether or not they actually are being fair in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWhtqK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle link to the web to sign up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_lfLKzYhZG4Hpchu1XaBtVSESw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69806725/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppIiJC"&gt;While vocal app developers accused Apple last week of spinning a lawsuit settlement into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;an App Store change that was barely a change at all&lt;/a&gt;, the company appears to be making a true, if small concession today: Apple says it will let developers of “reader” apps (think Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon’s Kindle app) directly link their customers to their own sign-up website, where they could potentially skirt Apple’s in-app payment system (and its 30 percent cut) entirely, in those cases where they haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLwik"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/"&gt;In a press release&lt;/a&gt;, Apple claims that the move will close an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), and that it’ll only apply to those sorts of “reader” apps right now — a category that was originally designed by Apple to placate companies like Netflix and Hulu by allowing them to let users simply sign into their existing account instead of signing up for a new subscription via the App Store (and having to pay Apple’s fees).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBg1OS"&gt;The JFTC has confirmed the agreement &lt;a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/en/pressreleases/yearly-2021/September/210902.html"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt; of its own, saying that the move by Apple “would eliminate the suspected violation of the Antimonopoly Act.” The commission, which has been investigating Apple since 2016, says the company has pledged to report on the status of app review transparency once a year for the next three years. According to the JFTC, Apple proposed changing its app review guidelines in response to the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Rk61c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t sign up for Netflix in the app. We know it’s a hassle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AywYGE"&gt;Currently, the Netflix and Spotify apps on iOS are useless if you don’t already have a subscription: both of them only offer a sign-in page, with no link out to their website, and a cheeky apology. “You can’t sign up for Netflix in the app. We know it’s a hassle,” reads the Netflix app’s splash page. The Amazon Kindle app, by contrast, offers a basic “Create a new Amazon account” page inside the app itself, but doesn’t let you buy books there, or even in the standard Amazon app. You have to go to a mobile browser to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGLefKU-OG9ML3YGcbPRlxYRXbE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22821705/netflix_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The message that greets you when opening the Netflix app on iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sB9svf"&gt;The rule change has an extremely limited scope, as Apple claims it only agreed to let developers of so-called reader apps to “share a single link to their website to help users set up and manage their account.” Apple also says it will “help developers of reader apps protect users when they link them to an external website to make purchases,” which suggests it will have specific guidelines for how these links appear. It’s not clear whether developers will be able to mention pricing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SEdgJj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There are just as many questions as answers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Does Apple still get to define “reader” app by fiat?&lt;br&gt;- Can apps explicitly mention payment or price or is that muzzled?&lt;br&gt;- One link - where does it go? Are there rules?&lt;a href="https://t.co/KuKgj9dXuW"&gt;https://t.co/KuKgj9dXuW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1433236886953279489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgu1dG"&gt;It’s also worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation"&gt;when Apple rejected the Hey email app&lt;/a&gt;, and even after it later modified that controversial decision, the company was very clear that email apps do not count as “reader” apps, even if you similarly subscribe outside of the app and the only thing you can do without an account is sign in. Apple is the one that decides which apps qualify as reader apps to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe8wZY"&gt;It also seems like Apple may be slightly redefining what a “reader” app means: &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps"&gt;While the company’s App Review Guidelines suggest&lt;/a&gt; that a reader app “may” allow users to access previously purchased content (presumably alongside in-app purchases, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;like Netflix offered for years&lt;/a&gt;), Apple’s new press release specifies that “developers of reader apps &lt;strong&gt;do not offer in-app digital goods and services for purchase&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(bolding ours). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZ6Kh2"&gt;That would mean that Apple’s only offering this exception to companies that aren’t contributing any in-app purchase commissions to Apple anyways. Which, admittedly, include some of Apple’s sternest critics like Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmkXq5"&gt;However, Spotify isn’t impressed: CEO Daniel Ek &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1433465642737446917"&gt;tweeted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s move is merely “a step in the right direction,” and signaled that the company will keep pushing for new laws like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;the Open App Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fkiIRh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't solve the problem. App developers want clear, fair rules that apply to all apps. Our goal is to restore competition once and for all, not one arbitrary, self-serving step at a time. We will continue to push for a real solution &lt;a href="https://t.co/vzIoBpZQr1"&gt;https://t.co/vzIoBpZQr1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Ek (@eldsjal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1433465642737446917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="41zNte"&gt;The new rule also doesn’t apply to games, of course, the App Store’s biggest and most profitable category and the one at the center of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;trial. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1433234998107201539"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney&lt;/a&gt; obviously thinks that’s unfair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sazzs1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In Apple's carefully-worded statement on safety, it's hard to discern the rationale that this is safe while Fortnite accepting direct payments remains unsafe.&lt;br&gt;Even more so if Apple deems Roblox, a game from 2006-2021 that became "an experience" mid-trial, a reader app.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1433234998107201539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MfifXJ"&gt;Some critics of Apple’s anti-steering rules have suggested they’d like to advertise inside their app that they charge users less at their own website than via Apple’s IAP — since they wouldn’t have to pay Apple that extra 30 percent, they could pass along the savings. But if Apple’s “reader” category doesn’t wind up including apps that offer IAP, that idea probably won’t be possible under Apple’s new rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qre5ui"&gt;It may be a while before we find out the answers to these questions: Apple says the rule won’t go into effect until early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants a Watch with more health tracking and could ship one next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Apple Watch with a red wristband sitting on a table, showing the blood oxygen app. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Z__tueWCUapiDH9cJIZsAxj8gk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804936/vpavic_200930_4216_0239.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xqG5yh"&gt;Apple apparently&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has a growing wishlist of health features for future versions of the Apple Watch, some feasible and some far-fetched. According to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s plans include various types of monitoring, including blood pressure, temperature, sleep, and blood sugar. The details come just after reports that the release of the next Apple Watch is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;likely to be delayed&lt;/a&gt; because of manufacturing issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upEVw8"&gt;Some of the planned features outlined by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; involve adding new sensors to the Watch. Apple wants to develop a sensor that can act as a proxy for a blood pressure cuff without squeezing the wrist. Blood pressure measurement has been in Apple’s plans for years; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/7/17438526/apple-blood-pressure-monitor-patent-apple-watch"&gt;filed a patent application&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 for a wearable blood pressure monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjcQv0"&gt;Apple’s competitors are also interested in blood pressure tracking. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch was approved to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295264/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-blood-pressure-tracking-ecg-korea"&gt;track changes in blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; in South Korea last year. There’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236373/samsung-galaxy-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-health-fda"&gt;debate around the accuracy&lt;/a&gt; and usefulness of the feature, and it has to be calibrated with measurements from conventional blood pressure cuffs every four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDY6p1"&gt;Apple had plans to add a temperature sensor to this year’s Watch, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;earlier reports from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the addition appears to have been&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;pushed to next year. The first slated use for temperature sensing, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, might involve&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fertility tracking, with hopes that it could eventually detect fevers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1WvhI"&gt;Other wearables, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon’s Halo Band&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399307/fitbit-sense-versa-3-smartwatch-inspire-2-fitness-tracker-ecg-eda-stress"&gt;Fitbit’s Sense&lt;/a&gt;, have sensors for skin temperature, though that measurement is different from the internal body temperature read by a thermometer. Earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568421/natural-cycles-birth-control-app-oura-ring-fda"&gt;Food and Drug Administration cleared digital birth control Natural Cycles&lt;/a&gt; to use temperature data from wearables like the Oura smart ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NgLwoY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has been chasing some of these features for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdi1vg"&gt;Apple also wants to expand the Watch’s sleep and blood oxygen tracking abilities, says the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, to someday be able to detect sleep apnea, a disorder that causes people to stop breathing during sleep. Sleep disorders are complicated, and diagnostic sleep studies involve multiple kinds of monitoring through the night. For that feature to work,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Apple would probably&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have to figure out the best times to take blood oxygen readings — keeping the sensor on all night would drain the battery pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRrjFm"&gt;Apple reportedly also plans to seek FDA clearance for existing Watch features, like heart rhythm tracking for people with irregular heart rhythms and alerts for drops in blood oxygen levels. The current FDA clearance for the Watch’s EKG feature doesn’t include use by people who have a diagnosed heart rhythm condition like atrial fibrillation, and the Watch’s blood oxygen monitor isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance"&gt;cleared as a medical device&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV5fIQ"&gt;One of the furthest-out features that Apple is continuing to study, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, is blood sugar tracking and diabetes detection. Apple has been trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15685148/apple-watch-glucose-tracker-blood-sugar-monitoring-diabetes"&gt;develop noninvasive glucose monitoring&lt;/a&gt; for years and reportedly hasn’t had much success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2xPcL"&gt;The anonymous sources cited by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; caution that many of the features being considered “might never be rolled out to consumers.” Health tech advancements, and regulatory approval for them, take years of development and testing. As much as companies want to add a slew of health features to wearables — and even as wearables are more commonly used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;in medical research&lt;/a&gt; — they’re still not advanced enough to replace&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;conventional diagnostic tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVxMIO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says Arizona and Georgia will be first to add state IDs to iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HL-nlwJzhCvdHLRt7SNK_ToFvRk=/129x0:2871x1828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803242/license.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l76xkS"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-announces-first-states-to-adopt-drivers-licenses-and-state-ids-in-wallet/"&gt;announced the first US states&lt;/a&gt; that will support iOS 15’s new ability to store driver’s licenses and state IDs in the Wallet app. Arizona and Georgia will lead the way, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah following after that. No timetable is given for exactly when the new feature will be adopted by these states, however: Apple only says that consumers can expect “more information at a later date.” And the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has again confirmed it will open select airport checkpoints and security lanes to Apple’s mobile IDs once states begin making them available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCu4N4"&gt;Adding a state ID or driver’s license to Apple’s Wallet app works similarly to the way you currently add a credit card. But after scanning your license or ID with your iPhone’s camera, you’re also required to provide a selfie that your state can use for verification purposes. Apple says “users will also be prompted to complete a series of facial and head movements during the setup process” for added security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjsVb3"&gt;Apple is also again emphasizing the privacy protections it has in place for driver’s licenses and state IDs, noting that “Apple and the issuing states do not know when or where users present their IDs” and that biometric authentication is required for the data to be shared. IDs are “presented digitally through encrypted communication directly between the device and the identity reader, so users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYKbqcHbSmH_6pk5prlO3J5q0n0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819957/tsa.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says the TSA will only be able to see specific requested information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E64ENi"&gt;With that last part, it seems Apple is trying to address the concerns that some have raised over what mobile IDs could mean for interactions with police and other law enforcement. It sounds like you won’t ever have to fully unlock your phone to share a mobile ID. The idea that the TSA will let you breeze through security without at least being &lt;em&gt;shown&lt;/em&gt; your phone’s screen feels like a stretch, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAI7M8"&gt;Apple says its implementation of mobile IDs “supports the ISO 18013-5 mDL (mobile driver’s license) standard which Apple has played an active role in the development of, and which sets clear guidelines for the industry around protecting consumers’ privacy when presenting an ID or driver’s license through a mobile device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tls9lJ"&gt;Apple is clearly attempting to counter any hesitancy about the new feature, and proponents of digital IDs maintain that they’re safer and more secure than physical documents. But the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/am/deeplinks/2021/07/dhss-flawed-plan-mobile-drivers-licenses"&gt;ACLU and Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; have cautioned that “longer-term, if digital IDs replace physical documents entirely, or if physical-only document holders are placed at a disadvantage, that could have significant implications for equity and fairness in American life.” They’ve also criticized the federal government for trying to intertwine mobile driver’s licenses with the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/real-id"&gt;REAL ID program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4KCrd"&gt;This new functionality will be included in iOS 15 when the software update is released this fall, but states will dictate if and when they get on board with Apple’s Wallet-based state IDs and driver’s licenses. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password subscriptions are 50 percent off for Verge readers today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52UQahxcn0uMeTuTL6gMzvbz41s=/63x0:1938x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802439/item_details_view.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yk8VZ1"&gt;Many of us would agree that online protection is more vital than ever before, but trying to remember a random string of letters and symbols for every site you frequent — or don’t — isn’t always easy. Password managers like 1Password are a great way to store your login credentials and beef up your security, however, one that can also save you plenty of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDv1yP"&gt;Thankfully, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can save 50 percent on their first year of 1Password for a limited time, whether they opt for an &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-15026552?sid=VergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;individual plan&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-15026551?sid=VergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;family subscription&lt;/a&gt;. The individual plan normally runs $2.99 a month and comes out to be around $36 per year, yet our exclusive discount brings the annual price down to $18. The family plan, meanwhile, will run you $2.50 a month instead of $5, culminating in $30 a year. Keep in mind, however, that the family plan is limited to five people and that each plan is only available to new 1Password users, not returning customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7rckI"&gt;In terms of features, 1Password offers quite a few. Not only does the service store your login details, but it will send you alerts for compromised sites and vulnerable passwords, while security features like authenticated encryption keep your data safe. You can also use the service on unlimited devices and enjoy 24/7 customer support if you hit a snag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0nXk1j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10426335"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="XTiUco"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10437502"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Us84ji"&gt;If you have yet to pick up a smart speaker, the second-generation Echo Show 8 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-8-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B084DC4LW6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688708099700197#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $100, matching its best price ever. Unlike the previous generation, the 2021 Echo Show 8 boasts faster performance and a superior 13-megapixel camera. It also features the same display, design, and speaker system as its predecessor, which is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-8/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for $80&lt;/a&gt;. We consider the second-gen model the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart speaker you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you intend to use the smart display for video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qwPCKk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mdfWru"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08WFTZ9LY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling&lt;/a&gt; the 75-inch QLED Q80A Series TV at an all-time low, taking around $500 off the typical list price. Normally $2,700, you can pick up the TV — which was released earlier this year — for just $2,198. Better yet, a few &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers saw in the fine print that if you purchase it before September 30th and use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;B6PXLX23DQL9&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout, Amazon will give you $400 in credit to use on future purchases. Not a bad deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSEQma"&gt;The 4K TV delivers wide viewing angles thanks to its IPS panel while producing bright and colorful images. It’s a good buy for gamers, too, who will enjoy the low input lag and support for variable refresh rate (VRR) and AMD FreeSync technology. While we haven’t tested this specific model, &lt;a href="https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/content/samsung-q80a-qled-tv-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reviewed&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that movie fans may not appreciate the low contrast levels or relatively lackluster local dimming feature, which can make it hard to watch HDR content or films in a dark room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Op1XkD"&gt;Amazon’s current deal comes just a week after the retailer also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08WFLBLWP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cut the price of the 55-inch model by $200&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it to a record low of $1,098. Other sizes are similarly discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="g1p9br"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds, you can pick up a refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164914311936%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeGetaoneyear1Passwordsubscriptionfor50percentoffAUG312021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651065%2F1password-amazon-echo-show-8-samsung-qled-tv-jabra-elite-85t-apple-deals-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$117 at eBay through Jabra’s digital storefront&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;SAVE15LABORDAY&lt;/strong&gt;. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Amazon for $180 new&lt;/a&gt;, meaning eBay’s refurbished discount equates to an additional $63 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk6SHI"&gt;Released in November, the 85t are the first pair of earbuds from Jabra to ship with active noise cancellation. In contrast to the AirPods Pro and Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds, they’re also capable of simultaneously pairing with two devices. You can also buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688339690161172#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t at best Buy right now for $100&lt;/a&gt;, however, if you want solid noise cancellation and excellent on-earbud controls, it may be worth forking over the extra $17 for the refurbished Elite 85t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2zWZiX"&gt;For a limited time, Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Smart Battery Case is more than half off its usual price. Once again, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHMJ77/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750684926448631384#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are both selling the $130 case for a record low of $52. Best Buy is also throwing in a free, six-month subscription to Apple Music and Apple News Plus for new users. The case offers a decent amount of charge — Apple says you can expect “up to 50 percent” extra battery life — while boasting features such as a physical camera button and the ability to charge your iPhone and battery case simultaneously. At the same time, its soft microfiber lining gives your phone some additional protection.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pledges another small but welcome sum to racial justice</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9Y_J8KAdDaqwZr6u6njzXwXsLI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801019/VRG_4132_BigTechs_Commitment_Lede_FR.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2rpl3"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-broadens-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-with-30-million-in-new-commitments%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22651312%2Fapple-pledges-another-small-but-welcome-sum-to-racial-justice" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has pledged&lt;/a&gt; another $30 million to racial justice, on top of the $100 million it promised last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV1EwC"&gt;It includes funding for a wide array of causes, including a Global Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Equity Innovation Hub at California State University Northridge in Los Angeles, with the intent to create regional hubs at other universities, and an expansion of its work to bring community coding centers to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by adding 11 additional schools to the roster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MXnnS"&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;we calculated just how small the donations from Big Tech were compared to their immense profits&lt;/a&gt;, and today’s $30 million doesn’t really change the calculus there. At the rate Apple is currently raking in cash, it takes just 2.31 hours, or roughly 139 minutes, to make $30 million in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UTzh38"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$30 million for Apple is like $7.51 to the median US family&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drXnY3"&gt;Or — to bring the comparison down to earth a bit — it’s like if &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-270.html"&gt;a middle-class US family&lt;/a&gt; made a one-time donation of seven dollars and fifty-one cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmKs0I"&gt;It’s also not entirely clear how much of Apple’s now-$130 million contribution is in the form of donations, rather than investments where Apple might get its money back: in January, the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fapple-launches-major-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-projects-to-challenge-systemic-racism-advance-racial-equity-nationwide%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22651312%2Fapple-pledges-another-small-but-welcome-sum-to-racial-justice" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;revealed at least $35 million would be invested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UezQqT"&gt;Still, it’s notable that Apple’s still sending significant sums towards racial justice at all, when an expert we quoted last year suggested that companies might turn their attention elsewhere when the moment fades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkWXhT"&gt;Cash also isn’t everything. There’s also institutional change to consider. Also: “It’s not just about where you’re going, but it’s also about owning up to where you have been, and how you may have contributed to a situation that exists right now, and that the wealth and prosperity of your business could be rooted in, is likely rooted in, some deep-seated inequities,” Laura Morgan Roberts, a professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, told us last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just banned a pay equity Slack channel but lets fun dogs channel lie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JWVCQwr9uJNoWOPcE2IibS19BNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799661/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esd1Pe"&gt;Apple has barred employees from creating a Slack channel to discuss pay equity. A member of the employee relations team, Apple’s version of HR, said that while the topic was “aligned with Apple’s commitment to pay equity,” it did not meet the company’s Slack Terms of Use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIofAS"&gt;“Slack channels are provided to conduct Apple business and must advance the work, deliverables, or mission of Apple departments and teams,” the employee relations representative told employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yw7RUv"&gt;The company’s rules for the in-office chat app say that “Slack channels for activities and hobbies not recognized as Apple Employee clubs or Diversity Network Associations (DNAs) aren’t permitted and shouldn’t be created.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fy9v7"&gt;But that rule has not been evenly enforced. Currently, Apple employees have popular Slack channels to discuss #fun-dogs (more than 5,000 members), #gaming (more than 3,000 members), and #dad-jokes (more than 2,000 members). On August 18th, the company approved a channel called #community-foosball. The cat and dog channels are not part of official clubs, and all of these channels were specifically created to talk about non-work activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3HsKp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A clear cut act of retaliation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkWApN"&gt;Employment attorney Vincent P. White says that invoking the Slack terms may simply be an excuse to block discussions of workplace pay disparities since doing so outright would violate labor law. “Discussing pay equity is a protected activity under federal, state, and local law,” says White. “Everyone agrees on that. For them to try and impair employees’ ability to discuss pay equity and diversity in the workplace is a clear cut act of retaliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpAc4Z"&gt;Pay equity has been a hot topic among Apple employees over the past few months. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;shut down multiple employee surveys&lt;/a&gt; aimed at gathering data on how much workers make. One survey, started by Apple engineer Cher Scarlett, has seemingly been allowed to stay up. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22633141/apple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap"&gt;early analysis of the results&lt;/a&gt; showed a 6 percent wage gap between the salaries of men and women who participated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWD00m"&gt;Now, organizers want to create a space for employees to discuss pay issues. While Apple previously said it did not have a pay equity problem, employees are suspicious. The company’s recent behavior, including shutting down pay surveys and now banning a pay equity Slack channel, has only exacerbated those concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P26x2q"&gt;“It sure is very convenient for Apple that these Terms of Use that they wrote are extremely useful for crushing free and open communication among employees,” one source says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgBDEg"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Apple Watch may be delayed due to manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Dip8joi6vMbZfwteRY8D3OW2vg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799013/vpavic_200929_4216_0137.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y7rr4A"&gt;The next Apple Watch is experiencing manufacturing issues that could lead to the product being released later than expected, according to separate reports from &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Watch-production-delayed-as-engineers-wrestle-with-quality-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-31/apple-s-new-watch-will-likely-be-delayed-over-production-snags"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The potential delay is reportedly due to complexities in the smartwatch’s new design, which is rumored to include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;flat sides and bigger screens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te1ypv"&gt;Sources told &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; that small-scale production for the next Apple Watch had begun but that it encountered “critical challenges in reaching satisfactory production performance.” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported similar details. Production has now been “temporarily halted” while Apple and its suppliers work to solve the manufacturing issues ahead of eventual mass production, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AiXY9p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The next Apple Watch is expected to be called the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Se0EIi"&gt;The new Apple Watch, expected to be called the Apple Watch Series 7, will see screen size increases to 41mm and 45mm (a 1mm bump from the currently available options), a faster processor, and “a flatter display and edges,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman reported &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;in his Power On newsletter on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. While Gurman reported that the Series 7 won’t bring any big health upgrades “until at least next year,” &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports that the new Watch will add new features “such as blood pressure measurement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh9V18"&gt;Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 6 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21430844/apple-event-recap-biggest-announcements-watch-series-6-se-ipad-air"&gt;at an event last September&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is expected to host another September product event this year. Given these reported production challenges with the next Apple Watch, if Apple does host a September event, there’s a possibility the Apple Watch might not make an appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZL4Ty"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
