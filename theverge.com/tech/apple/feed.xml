    <title>Apple’s latest beta fixes macro mode confusion for iPhone 13 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5W9JkytYNdBsQxGz5QGhWFNy_2M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70134949/vpavic_210916_untitled_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b87aYY"&gt;Apple’s latest iOS 15.2 beta is making the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro mode simple by adding a button to let you turn it on and off (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/12/iphone-gets-macro-mode-toggle-in-camera-app/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The icon, which looks like a little flower, pops up whenever you’re close enough to an object to take a macro photo and lets you easily switch between having Auto Macro mode on and off without having to go into settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzPf58"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/aD0QQhaPAwQ?t=324"&gt;video from &lt;em&gt;ZolloTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;shows how the feature currently works in iOS 15.2 beta 2: if you have  Auto Macro turned off, the button will appear when you get close to something. Tapping it seems to basically turn Auto Macro back on, and your phone will switch into macro mode. Tapping the button again turns Auto Macro off and switches you back to the regular camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yggmfd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10861923"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5kTaPV"&gt;When the iPhone 13 launched, some reviewers said the automatic transition to macro mode could be jarring, as the phone was switching lenses without showing that the change had happened in the UI (the lens indicator doesn’t change from 1x to 0.5x as it normally would). Apple fixed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713135/iphone-13-camera-features-prores-macro-ios-15-1-beta-3"&gt;by introducing a toggle&lt;/a&gt; (Settings &amp;gt; Camera &amp;gt; Auto Macro) that let you turn off the automatic switching, but that made things a little complicated. Just switching to the ultra-wide camera and getting close to your subject would get you different results than macro mode would — to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745578/iphone-13-pro-macro-mode-how-to"&gt;fully replicate the macro effect&lt;/a&gt;, you’d also have to manually zoom in to 0.9x. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jxO38N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This change makes things simple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1I1VST"&gt;The change in 15.2 beta 2 makes things simple. If you don’t want to think about it, you can leave Auto Macro on, and your iPhone 13 Pro will take a macro picture if you’re close enough to an object. If you’d prefer finer control, or find the switch jarring, you can turn Auto Macro off but still have easy access to the mode if you want it through the button that will pop up when the phone thinks you’re trying to take a macro picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSgYI9"&gt;While this is probably how the system should’ve worked from the start, it’s good to see that it’s finally making its way on to phones. Hopefully this fix will stay the same through the beta process and be part of the 15.2 final release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: How EV startup Rivian achieved a record-breaking IPO</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4dFljI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NJIBjo"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5095084519&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VCtrBf"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter, along with managing editor Alex Cranz and senior reporter Sean O’Kane, discuss electric vehicle startup Rivian becoming a publicly traded company after executing one of the biggest initial public offerings in history. This leads to a discussion on how Rivian got to this point where other EV startups have failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CZR77J"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;Rivian goes public in one of the biggest IPOs ever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QP0FZb"&gt;There’s a whole lot more news covered on the show, especially from Apple. This week, we saw:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SF89S9"&gt;And surprise! More news. Microsoft had a few announcements this week as well: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Invasion’s creepy alien reveal was worth the wait</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Invasion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45mkUDYvyjJwkq1vLDS5JPcRWdM=/480x0:3360x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132841/Invasion_Photo_010508.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GFjmVk"&gt;It took half of a season, but we’re finally here: the aliens have shown themselves in &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt;. The Apple TV Plus series got off to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"&gt;a slow start&lt;/a&gt; when it debuted in October. The first handful of episodes were tense character drama, focusing on a few characters spread across the globe, each of whom was dealing with some personal issues in addition to the titular attack on the planet. That was all well and good, but the sci-fi elements were so scant that you could blink and miss them. No one even said the word “alien” until episode five. But now that we’re halfway through the season, that’s changed. The latest episode finally shows the creepy off-world invaders, and it has given the show the purpose it needs — along with some scares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dbcps"&gt;If you haven’t watched the show yet, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is probably best described as &lt;em&gt;This is Us&lt;/em&gt; mashed up with &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. It takes a big idea — aliens are invading seemingly every part of the world — but explores it through a series of small, intimate stories. There’s a mother learning about an unfaithful spouse, a US soldier on his own in Afghanistan, and a bus full of English teens that crashes in the middle of nowhere, among others. Each of these characters is not only dealing with their own shit but also the early stages of the invasion. No one even knows what’s going on. Amidst power outages, mysterious objects crashing from space, and the occasional synchronized nosebleed, there’s a lot of misplaced blame on “the Russians” or unspecified terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZFX68"&gt;Viewers, of course, have known all along that it’s aliens. It’s right there in the title of the show. But the hints for the actual characters living through the invasion have been sparse, sporadic, and confusing. Now things are becoming more clear. In episode five, we got a tease of just how strange these invaders might be when a doctor named Aneesha (played by Golshifteh Farahani, whose distraught performance remains a highlight of the show) notices a spiky little blob while stitching up a patient. It’s gross and dangerous-looking. It also seems alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSdAaW"&gt;It turns out that was just a taste. In episode six, after a brief detour that started out as a hunt for food and ended up as a short-term residency at a field hospital, Aneesha returns to the house her family has been staying in, only to find it empty and boarded-up like something from a zombie movie. Except it’s not empty; &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is lurking around. You see and hear it in brief, terrifying flashes. The whole house will start to shake unexpectedly. Giant, spider-like legs scurry in the background. At one point, you can see the full creature but as a tiny reflection in a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="invasion" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l8WLDrnD0FTv56naoDQp2I_dQKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005242/Invasion_Photo_010503.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UTLTEV"&gt;Like everything else in &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt;, the build-up is slow and methodical. But it works: it’s almost like a horror movie, one that takes its time before showing the monster in its full, terrifying glory. And the reveal here is wonderful, as you watch a tortuous sequence where the creature terrorizes the family as they attempt to make an escape. Seeing the alien doesn’t take away from its mystery or menace at all. In fact, it just raises more questions about how these spindly black blobs managed to coordinate a planet-wide attack and what exactly it is they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW7K68"&gt;What I’m saying is, the slow-burn reveal was worth it. Not only are the aliens unexpected and scary, but their arrival also makes almost every character’s arc more interesting. Before, as engaging as many of the personal stories were, it felt a lot like a bunch of people floundering around during the end of the world. Now there’s some purpose. That’s especially true with Mitsuki Yamato (Shioli Kutsuna), an obsessed Japanese space technician who appears to be the only one close to figuring out what’s going on with the invaders. More than just moving the plot forward, though, the blobby bugs from space have introduced a tangible threat. It’s no longer just some weird stuff going on — it’s a bunch of killer spiders sneaking around every city on the planet for unknown reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dncTTx"&gt;I’m glad I stuck it out to see the aliens. But they do introduce a new problem for &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; because now the show has to do it all over again. The first five episodes were a slow build-up that ultimately paid off, but we’re just over halfway through the story at this point, so there’s plenty to go. The reveal worked, but the next test will be seeing if the show can connect all of its many stories into something satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>World’s first USB-C iPhone sells on eBay for $86,001</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMn_XL__RTecS6p-9n3QoN3_Ueg=/0x0:768x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70131929/msedge_8C53o6F5aS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OXksGg"&gt;A modified iPhone X that has a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F165161363347&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22777988%2Fusb-c-iphone-x-lightning-ebay-auction-86001" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sold on eBay&lt;/a&gt; for the princely sum of $86,001. The phone, which is the work of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722123/first-iphone-usb-c-port-robotics-engineering-student-custom"&gt;robotics engineering student Kenn Pillonel&lt;/a&gt;, can use the physical connector for both charging and transferring data. But Pillonel warns that the buyer &lt;a href="http://vi.vipr.ebaydesc.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItemDescV4&amp;amp;item=165161363347&amp;amp;t=0&amp;amp;category=9355&amp;amp;seller=geeken&amp;amp;excSoj=1&amp;amp;excTrk=1&amp;amp;lsite=0&amp;amp;ittenable=false&amp;amp;domain=ebay.com&amp;amp;descgauge=1&amp;amp;cspheader=1&amp;amp;oneClk=2&amp;amp;secureDesc=0&amp;amp;oversion=f3d3fc33"&gt;shouldn’t use the groundbreaking device as a regular phone&lt;/a&gt;, take it apart, or update the OS — any of which could risk breaking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2qoMU"&gt;The fact that the mod has sold for over eighty times its original sale price shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Although Pillonel has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759704/usb-c-iphone-hack-mod-open-source-github-repo-ken-pillonel-design-video"&gt;open-sourced his work on the project&lt;/a&gt; in a Github repository containing technical details, CNC instructions, and information on the custom PCB the design uses, actually replicating the modification is no mean feat. Especially since it involves installing extra circuitry into the phone’s chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MvNfAL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVEQJNRmfDQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dWWc7L"&gt;The auction started at just $1, but bidding had reached over $3,000 by the end of its first day, before quickly climbing into the tens of thousands. There were also a couple of much higher bids of around $100,000 that were retracted before the auction came to an end. It attracted a total of 116 bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXaW8w"&gt;Although the prototype has now been sold, Pillonel has previously said he intends to continue working to improve elements like the USB-C iPhones’ fast-charging, waterproofing, and adding support for USB-C accessories. With the design open-sourced, and the prototype released into the world, it’s a project that’ll hopefully become a team effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szUoit"&gt;If you’d like to hear more about Pillonel’s project, check out his appearance on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772024/vergecast-podcast-usb-c-future"&gt;the Vergecast&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 has often recieved the biggest discounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year — and we’re bound to see far more as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday approach&lt;/a&gt;. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwEyX"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 by $30, bringing the price down to $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $199 instead of $229. Like the 38mm model, it’s also available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-42mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101062" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, though, not at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="title"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version with a silver aluminum case and an abyss blue sport band for $270 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F305879066&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other configurations — as well as the larger, 44mm model with GPS — are currently only available at full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. Right now, for instance, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red variant &lt;/a&gt;at Amazon right now for $349, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm model with GPS is your fancy, it’s available in white, navy, and red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $379, slightly more than its best-ever price. The red configuration is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for the same price, as is the black model at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-44mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band%2F-%2FA-80606297" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hZHCRf"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. There are very few deals to speak of right now, however, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model with a green Sport Band and green aluminum casing for $390 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a $10 discount. The 45mm model with GPS is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in red for $420.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vE4BzP"&gt;Although both deals are slight, it is possible that we’ll see bigger discounts as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday, especially given Amazon has taken between $30 and $40 off a number of different sizes and configurations of the Series 7 in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4m59DD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s unexciting 2021 Mac and iPhone software prove it should take a break from annual OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qRq7SHCJLRJiiCNR0ulhJp0cwg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130116/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZnL4b"&gt;Apple’s fall software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, are officially out in the world for everyone. But Apple’s latest software has arrived with more of a whimper than a bang; the two updates aren’t so much bad as they are &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Which has me wondering: why is Apple still clinging to its annual release schedule at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lXVnu"&gt;There are two problems that Apple’s annual cadence causes. The first, as is the case this year, is that iOS and macOS are increasingly mature operating systems with fewer issues to fix or missing features to add. Which, in turn, means that there are fewer opportunities for sweeping upgrades like there were in the early days when the iPhone getting copy and paste support was headline news. Short of Apple changing its mind about how its operating systems and the rules that govern it work — &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;like when it allowed for third-party email and browser apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;in iOS 14 &lt;/a&gt;— there’s just less room for big additions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s8ks4Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple macOS 12 Monterey review: the best is yet to come","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"},{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pjaj8I"&gt;Second is the fact that — because Apple silos off virtually all its updates, big or small, to help pad out the “big” iOS release — smaller but useful quality of life improvements often get stuck waiting around months for the fall cycle to line up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXjwLc"&gt;Take iOS 15, which added a grid view and the ability to blur a background in FaceTime, core features that have already been a key part of Zoom and Google Meet’s toolkits for making larger virtual conversations more organized. Neither appears to be the kind of earth-shattering, OS-level feature that would require waiting for a new version of iOS, but Apple saved the updates to be part of iOS 15 anyway, despite the fact that they undoubtedly would have been more useful during the height of the pandemic when video chatting was more heavily in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV2Lpr"&gt;Apple has, in fairness, already started to trend away from its one-and-done updates, if only because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;it’s missed its self-imposed deadlines&lt;/a&gt; multiple times. Major features for iOS and macOS like SharePlay or Universal Control have been delayed from the initial dot-zero builds for more development time. Point releases have gotten more and more important, too, used to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936510/apple-ios-13-2-airpods-pro-compatible"&gt;debut new emoji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265019/apple-ios-13-5-out-now-unlock-iphone-face-mask-id-exposure-notification-covid-19"&gt;critical Face ID updates for better mask support&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;Apple’s high-profile App Tracking Transparency requirement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MNSTz5"&gt;To solve the issues of lackluster annual updates, Apple should do two things. First, it should continue to build out point releases with additional features throughout the year or even unbundle app updates from its annual releases entirely. Did the FaceTime team come up with a great new feature that’ll make pandemic chatting easier? Release it when it’s ready! Second, it should start to space out its major software releases, waiting an extra year or two between iOS or macOS versions to ensure that when it does release a “new” operating system, there are actually big changes to be excited about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzPZiA"&gt;Spaced out software updates wouldn’t even be a new idea for Apple, at least on the macOS side of things. Apple spent almost a decade spacing out OS X releases every two years before it brought back annual releases with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mZbllQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spaced out updates aren’t a new idea for Apple, either&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxo47T"&gt;Sure, Apple does get some benefit from its current cadence. On a basic level, bundling iOS and macOS updates gives Apple a single, cohesive marketing push, a package of features that it can point to and say, “Look, here are all the ways the new software makes your life better.” The annual releases also mean that Apple can count on journalists writing roundups of the new features every year at WWDC and reviews of those new features in the fall, and Apple might have to risk that consistent coverage if it changes things up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j59DEI"&gt;But while the boosted public awareness is nice, I doubt that Apple would be missing out on much if it spaced out annual releases. New iPhones are not sold on the strength of having Apple’s new software installed; customers praised the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Airs&lt;/a&gt; because of their battery life and processing speed, not because they shipped with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck9iBC"&gt;People install iOS and macOS updates, but outside of the tech sphere, it’s not something that people are &lt;em&gt;eager&lt;/em&gt; to do. More often than not, Apple updates are installed out of a grudging frustration at push notifications and a desire to banish alert bubbles, not because Focus modes allow power users to set up more granular do-not-disturb settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1NH9kX03zjMNoq8Xubjz6hdSLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864029/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wl2uuH"&gt;Spacing out iOS and macOS updates for when Apple actually has big marquee features to show off (like it did during the OS X days when it actually &lt;em&gt;charged&lt;/em&gt; for new updates) could go a long way to fixing that unenthusiastic update cycle. Less frequent iOS updates could help make sure that there’s actually something to get excited for, like a new visual design or substantial new features (like Siri). Additionally, Apple would get more time to develop new versions of its software, which could theoretically cut down on the bugs and glitches in the final versions of whatever it does ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Crtfgq"&gt;Smaller updates, meanwhile, can be doled out over the year when they’re ready, instead of waiting to cluster every minor update into a massive, overwhelming grab bag once a year where they’re more likely to be overshadowed anyway by the more substantial parts of the new operating system. More gradual updates that aren’t tied to a single major release is an idea we know works, too, because it’s how every other third-party app on iOS already handles updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0w6US"&gt;But right now, Apple’s system of annual releases leaves it with the worst of both worlds: siloed updates that come too infrequently for minor features while still not having enough major features to be worth the hype. If Apple can’t make macOS and iOS updates more substantial, it might be time to leave the annual release cycle behind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Apple Pay and Touch ID on an external Magic Keyboard can get complicated</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mropuN"&gt;Publications like &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/11/apple-pay-doesnt-work-on-your-magic-keyboard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported some odd behavior when trying to use Apple’s Magic Keyboard with Touch ID to authenticate for Apple Pay — specifically, that it won’t work if you’re trying to do it with a MacBook that has its display closed, as it would be while running it in “clamshell mode” hooked up to an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECgIvc"&gt;Obviously, when the MacBook’s lid is closed, you can’t use the built-in Touch ID sensor, so it’s easy to see how this limitation was put in place. But in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Apple sells an external keyboard with the sensor&lt;/a&gt; (starting at &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK293LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english"&gt;an eye-watering $150&lt;/a&gt;), it’s an awkward limitation. That’s especially true given that the keyboard’s Touch ID functionality only works with Apple Silicon-powered Macs and comes with all but the base-level iMac. That means that most of the people buying it will likely be laptop users looking for a way to type while their laptop is docked (maybe even with the screen closed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rYYp5l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If it’s safe enough for an M1 Mac Mini, it’s safe enough for a docked MacBook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fiiiec"&gt;Hopefully Apple will let its users make payments with their external keyboard soon, no matter what the state of their laptop’s lid is. It’s understandable that Apple wants to make sure that payment authentication is a secure process — &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;’s article&lt;/a&gt; mentions a load of other security settings that can affect being able to use Touch ID with Apple Pay — but if it’s safe enough to use with the M1 Mac Mini, it should be safe enough to use with a docked laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6CIcJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated November 11th, 4:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that this behavior appears to be intentional, rather than a bug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS beta blurs nude images for children using Messages app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ZZ1sPIkrsfwTYCTNkf1mYR8iPw=/0x1:920x614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70126082/child_safety__cemgn2jzflqq_large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promotional images of the feature released earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mnUVnE"&gt;iOS 15.2’s latest beta adds an Apple Communication Safety feature to the Messages app, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The opt-in feature is designed to protect children from inappropriate imagery by scanning incoming and outgoing pictures for “sexually explicit” material. Any images meeting this description are blurred, and the child will be warned about its contents and told it’s ok not to view it. The feature, which ties into Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201060"&gt;existing Family Sharing system&lt;/a&gt;, is also designed to offer resources to affected children for them to get help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGXNnV"&gt;The version of the feature that’s released in iOS 15.2’s latest beta has one crucial difference from what Apple originally announced in August: it won’t send notifications to parents if a child decides to view a sexually explicit image. Critics like Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic instructor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423365222841135114"&gt;Kendra Albert&lt;/a&gt; objected to this element in particular because it could out queer or transgender children to their parents. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; also notes that in its original form, the feature could have introduced safety issues when a parent is violent or abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zJmBEN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xmUOH6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-to-beta-test-imessage-feature-that-warns-kids-about-nude-imagery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that children will instead have the choice of whether to alert someone they trust about a flagged photo, and that this choice is separate from the choice of whether to unblur and view the image. Checks are carried out on-device, and do not impact end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nie4hK"&gt;The Communication Safety feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;originally announced in August&lt;/a&gt; as part of a trio of features designed to protect children from sexual abuse. However, the company said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delaying the introduction of the features the following month&lt;/a&gt; in response to objections raised by privacy advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMjijr"&gt;Communication Safety is distinct from the CSAM-detection (child sexual abuse imagery detection) feature that scans a user’s iCloud Photos and reports offending content to Apple moderators, and which generated the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;bulk of the outcry from privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an update coming to Siri search that’s designed to offer resources if a user searches for topics relating to child sexual abuse. It’s currently unclear when these two features are planned for release, and there haven’t been reports of them appearing in Apple’s public beta software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcRKjg"&gt;It’s worth noting that features added to iOS 15.2’s latest beta could still change dramatically before its official release, and it may be removed from the update entirely. Other new features that have arrived in the latest beta include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774124/ios-15-2-beta-2-airtag-tracker-scan-privacy-invasion"&gt;manual AirTag scanning feature&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;pass on your iCloud data to a loved one&lt;/a&gt; in the case of your death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt11Ji"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WFue8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iCloud for Windows gets a built in password generator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTR8LPK4HIUJA_zKsdOu1Co9xHE=/1x0:1198x798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125933/2021_11_10_18_45_58_Microsoft_Store.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud for Windows’ password manager in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: iCloud for Windows&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2sLgL"&gt;A new update for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Ficloud%2F9pktq5699m62%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s iCloud Windows app&lt;/a&gt; has added a password generator, as well as support for Apple’s ProRaw and ProRes photo and video formats to the cloud storage utility. The update, which was first &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/10/icloud-windows-13/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also adds the ability for participants of a shared iCloud Drive file or folder to add or remove other users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fF7JP0"&gt;The addition of a password generator makes Apple’s iCloud keychain a much more viable cross-platform password manager. It follows an update in August which &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3629310/apple-brings-icloud-passwords-to-windows-microsofts-edge.html"&gt;allowed Windows users to access&lt;/a&gt; (but not generate) passwords from their iCloud account. Together with the &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3605098/icloud-passwords-are-coming-to-chrome-for-windows.html"&gt;Chrome iCloud extension&lt;/a&gt; Apple released at the beginning of the year, Windows iCloud users now have access to basic password management features when they’re away from their Apple device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WzA8Mz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plus new options to remove other users from shared files&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QpS9fs"&gt;Given the option, I’d personally still recommend that anyone looking for a password manager opt for a true platform-agnostic alternative. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;I recommend Bitwarden as the best free option&lt;/a&gt;, because as well as being available on Mac, iOS, and Windows, it’s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; available on Android, so you’re not locked in to Apple’s mobile platform if you want to switch in future. But using iCloud Keychain is better than not using a password manager at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GmrpN"&gt;Meanwhile, the addition of ProRes and ProRaw support is useful given that the latest iPhones are now capable of shooting in both formats. Making it easier to sync these with your Windows PC should be useful if you want to view them, or more likely edit them, on a Windows machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge buys Rittenhouse lawyer’s inane argument that Apple’s pinch-to-zoom manipulates footage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Trial Continues In Kenosha, WI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zDVoE_-vlqC4mlIOTgC89V94i-Q=/0x0:5043x3362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125363/1236486033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Krajacic-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vmv9F2"&gt;As Kyle Rittenhouse took the stand to answer questions about the sequence of events before he shot and killed a man in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the jury was forced to watch the video evidence play out in miniature — because Rittenhouse’s defense lawyer came up with the wild notion that Apple has “artificial intelligence” that manipulates footage when you pinch-to-zoom on an iPad, and Judge Bruce Schroeder totally bought into that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="raJUzK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The word he’s looking for is algorithms, but that’s beside the point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYw2Ho"&gt;“iPads, which are made by Apple, have artificial intelligence in them that allow things to be viewed through three-dimensions and logarithms,” the defense insisted. “It uses artificial intelligence, or their logarithms, to create what they believe is happening. So this isn’t actually enhanced video, this is Apple’s iPad programming creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltjm5U"&gt;While it’s unclear from a full video of the proceedings (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIzj48oL6T0&amp;amp;t=18145s"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) whether the judge actually prohibited the prosecution from using an iOS device or otherwise zooming into the footage, the result was the same: instead of using an iPad, the jury wound up watching the original, zoomed-out clips on a Windows machine hooked up to a large TV in the courtroom. The images didn’t fill the TV’s entire screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WuBA4y4JkmyBJzK_40Pt0j2In-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004713/image__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the first video clips Rittenhouse was questioned about, as presented to the jury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9zoKjo"&gt;Judge Schroeder argued that it was the prosecution — not the defense — that had the burden of proving that Apple &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; use artificial intelligence to manipulate footage, demanding that they provide an expert to testify, and didn’t allow the prosecution to adjourn to find that expert before bringing Rittenhouse up for cross-examination. The judge suggested that prosecutors could somehow find that expert in 20 minutes while they took a brief recess. “Maybe you can get someone to testify on this within minutes, I don’t know,” said the judge. No such expert was there by the time the trial resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dD9xmb"&gt;While the nature of reality with regards to digital images is thorny when it comes to things like color, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling"&gt;digital image scaling&lt;/a&gt; is fairly well understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GflCas"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/kyle-rittenhouse-charges.html"&gt;six criminal charges&lt;/a&gt; against Rittenhouse in connection to the shooting in Kenosha. He’s accused of killing two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3Iuii"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
