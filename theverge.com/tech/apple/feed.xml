    <title>Global chip shortage hits iPad and MacBook production, says report</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LWGPCr"&gt;Apple has not been spared the effects of the ongoing global component shortage, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/MacBook-and-iPad-production-delayed-as-supply-crunch-hits-Apple"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The publication says that some production of MacBooks and iPads has been delayed, with “a portion of component orders” pushed back to the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORd6Hb"&gt;The issue with MacBooks is said to be related to the ability to mount certain components on circuit boards ahead of the device’s assembly. Delayed iPad production, meanwhile, is apparently because of a shortage of displays and display components. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/why-shortages-of-a-1-chip-sparked-crisis-in-the-global-economy"&gt;Bloomberg reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; on how the squeezed supply of display drivers is causing a bottleneck across the entire tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lgUF4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When will the global chip shortage end so you can finally buy a PS5?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Msa7vE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; didn’t state which MacBook or iPad models would be affected, nor whether the postponed production was for existing devices or yet-to-be-announced updates. Apple is widely expected to launch new versions of the iPad Pro this year, as well as continuing the transition to deploying its own processors across the entire Mac line. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/"&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; that a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Mini LED display would go into mass production this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O13ILA"&gt;iPhone production is said to be unaffected so far, though two sources described component supply as “quite tight.” Nikkei says the shortage “remains a supply chain issue for Apple and has not yet had an impact on product availability.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chipolo’s new One Spot Bluetooth tracker beats Apple’s AirTags to the punch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIcKFONp23D8j1_YE8vMKmPyj4c=/7x0:1954x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091226/Apple_find_my_network_now_offers_new_third_party_finding_experiences_chipolo_040721_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nbliHC"&gt;The first Bluetooth tracker that can work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;Apple’s vast Find My Bluetooth network&lt;/a&gt; of iPhones, iPads, and Macs is here. But it’s not Apple’s long-anticipated AirTags tracker; it’s the &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/pages/chipolo-one-spot"&gt;Chipolo One Spot&lt;/a&gt;, an updated version of the company’s One tracker that’s designed to exclusively work with Apple’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLu17x"&gt;Chipolo calls the One Spot a “special edition” product. While it has the same 12-month battery life (with replaceable battery), 120dB ring, water resistance, and overall design as the regular One tracker, the One Spot &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works with Apple’s Find My network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9Di4LZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple officially starts letting your iPhone help find lost third-party products","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HscFen"&gt;That’s potentially an upgrade for anyone who already uses Apple products, given that a Bluetooth tracking tag is only as effective as the number of users who are on the same network. And while Chipolo has been around for a while, it’s still far smaller compared to more established players like Tile or the hundreds of millions of Apple devices around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bc0tl"&gt;The One Spot also features some Find My specific functionality, like a “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/use-lost-mode-mmfc0f0165/icloud"&gt;Lost Mode&lt;/a&gt;” that allows users to tag an item as missing — which will, in turn, notify other Find My users if it’s found with a short message and a phone number to help you get your stuff back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5j34u"&gt;It’s a sort of bewildering product, given the context of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;Apple’s rumored AirTags tracker&lt;/a&gt; that’s potentially going to be released later in 2021, and it would similarly be a Find My-exclusive Bluetooth tag for keeping track of lost or missing items. Chipolo’s tracker lacks the rumored Ultra-WideBand radio support that Apple’s tag will reportedly feature for more precise tracking, but that aside, it’s hard to imagine what else Apple’s tag will bring to the table that’s not already available on the One Spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLoWGI"&gt;Preorders for the Chipolo One Spot will start in May, with shipping planned for the beginning of June. No price has been announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVsr0YzytuT8HmtFZoPxwO-z8AM=/7x0:1954x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090172/Apple_Find_My_network_now_offers_new_third_party_finding_experiences_040721_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k5oMWW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22372016%2Fapple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is officially opening up&lt;/a&gt; its Find My tracking network to third-party companies (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;as it had promised last year&lt;/a&gt;.) Now, any hardware manufacturer can add software-side support for Apple’s localized network to track missing items — so long as they play by Apple’s Made for iPhone (MFi) accessory rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3KKTk"&gt;The first wave of items that can now be tracked starting today include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof’s S3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22162936/vanmoof-x3-long-term-review"&gt;X3 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;Belkin’s SoundForm Freedom True Wireless Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, and the Chipolo One Spot tracking tag — all of which can now rely on Apple’s crowdsourced Bluetooth network (which encompasses millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oBlSj"&gt;Users will be able to add those devices to the updated Find My app starting today and can track them through that app much in the same way that they’d track any missing Apple product. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRWl47qcc_MooRKhCYbIzv0ePy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427260/Apple_find_my_network_now_offers_new_third_party_finding_experiences_chipolo_040721_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chipolo’s Find My-compatible One Spot tracker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HAu2KR"&gt;Apple says that third-party devices looking to add support will have to apply through the company’s MFi program for authorized accessories and “adhere to all the privacy protections of the Find My network that Apple customers rely on.” Approved products will sport a new “Works with Apple Find My” badge to let customers know that they’re compatible with Apple’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oc3g2t"&gt;Additionally, Apple announced that it’d be offering a chipset specification for third-party hardware companies to integrate with the Ultra-Wideband systems in Apple’s more recent phones for even more precise tracking in the future. Apple has also long been rumored to be working on its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529927/apple-airtags-location-tracker-find-my-accessory-patent-applications-posture"&gt;AirTags product&lt;/a&gt;, which would offer similar UWB-based tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKEozp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jon Stewart’s Apple TV Plus show will debut this fall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Late Show with Stephen Colbert..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NcrQ2qvtXJUOI1zSbaGRSYkS14k=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089773/1150560659.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9KIamC"&gt;Jon Stewart is heading back to TV with a new Apple TV Plus show, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, which will debut this fall, Apple announced on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yso27H"&gt;“‘The Problem with Jon Stewart’ is a multiple season, one-hour, single-issue series which will explore topics that are currently part of the national conversation and his advocacy work,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-reveals-series-title-for-jon-stewarts-highly-anticipated-return-to-television-as-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-to-debut-in-fall-2021-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22371914%2Fjon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Each season of the series will be further explored in a companion podcast to continue the discussion.” Apple didn’t specify how many episodes will be included in each season or how many seasons the show will run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmjsb0"&gt;The iPhone maker says this is the first project of a multiyear partnership with the popular political commentator, so it sounds like we could see more shows with Stewart’s involvement on Apple TV Plus in the future. Apple has also signed a first-look deal with Stewart and his production company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFQf5Q"&gt;Apple first announced the show was in development &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"&gt;last October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt; marks Stewart’s return to TV, following the end of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, which wrapped in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kcSLEQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jon Stewart will return to TV with an Apple TV Plus series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade finally got the boost it needed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNbAP2eGnJ4kxD39kEkqb8vSygk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088559/opening2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoZQ7K"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad"&gt;Apple Arcade received its biggest update since launching back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. More than 30 titles were added to the subscription service, including much-anticipated games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362624/fantasian-release-date-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;Hironobu Sakaguchi’s roleplaying epic &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But while the quantity and quality of titles added were impressive, the most important part of the announcement was a change in direction. Among those big-name exclusives were a number of classics, ranging from &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/em&gt; to chess to &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;, that help round out the service. Apple Arcade has finally matured into something close to a Netflix for mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="xRwD9v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432584"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKXwLy"&gt;Since the beginning, the pitch for Apple Arcade has been entirely centered on quality. While the App Store continues to devolve into a space dominated by free-to-play games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman"&gt;Arcade provided an alternative&lt;/a&gt; where some of the most talented developers in the world could create great mobile games without having to worry about monetization. It launched alongside new games from the likes of Zach Gage and Ustwo, and it has continued to add titles on a near-weekly basis. Subscribers get all of those games for a flat monthly fee. It’s been a solid service — but it’s always felt like something was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91717B"&gt;When you sign up for something like Netflix, it might be because of one of the service’s big exclusive titles like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;. But that won’t necessarily keep you hooked. Part of what makes Netflix so compelling is &lt;em&gt;everything else&lt;/em&gt;, from reality shows to classic sitcoms, that give you something to watch after you’re done with the big tent poles. Frequently, these aren’t traditional exclusives: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297077/the-office-friends-peacock-hbo-max-streaming-wars-disney-plus-star"&gt;think of how important &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; have become in the age of streaming TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1gxGs"&gt;Those kinds of experiences are something Apple Arcade didn’t really have before this shift. Now, though, when you’re done playing a short narrative game like, say, &lt;em&gt;Creaks&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Assemble With Care&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a lot more to keep you invested with recent additions like &lt;em&gt;Good Sudoku&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EjgYix6_JhkfSAb-fHIf2BxEsqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425030/01_Welcome.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonderbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kM6Tyn"&gt;Even better, while many of these games are available on other platforms or through the App Store, the Arcade versions are generally improved because they feature no form of in-app purchases or monetization. You won’t find puzzle or card games saddled with ads or have to open loot boxes in &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K21&lt;/em&gt;. There’s even &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Legends&lt;/em&gt; — essentially a character-collecting gacha game — which almost feels strange to play without being prodded to spend money. (This lack of microtransactions makes Arcade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164414/apple-arcade-family-kids-crossy-road-butter-royale-loud-house-netflix"&gt;a very family-friendly service&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ayy0Rw"&gt;It’s also important to note that this change in strategy is additive. Apple has introduced two new categories to Arcade — one for older App Store hits, another for classic games like chess or solitaire — but it’s still releasing those big exclusive titles. In addition to &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, last week’s update included &lt;em&gt;Wonderbox&lt;/em&gt; (think &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; for younger players), &lt;em&gt;World of Demons&lt;/em&gt; (the latest action game from PlatinumGames, the team behind &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bayonetta&lt;/em&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin: Pop Tap Beat&lt;/em&gt; (a new entry in an excellent long-running rhythm game series). It’s a great and diverse lineup of experiences; sometimes scrolling through games on Arcade can feel like heading into an alternate reality version of what mobile gaming could have been if the race to free-to-play never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAVEO8"&gt;Obviously, none of this is a guarantee of success. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308657/apple-arcade-canceling-games-subscription-service-engagement"&gt;if previous reports are to be believed&lt;/a&gt;, the shift appears to be a result of Arcade’s inability to keep subscribers hooked. While the subscription model is now dominant for the music, film, and television industries, it’s still relatively nascent for games. Outside of Xbox Game Pass, there hasn’t been a major success to date. Apple Arcade arguably faces a greater challenge being on mobile, where users have long been conditioned to expect games for free. The Netflix of games still feels inevitable, even if we’re not there yet — but Arcade feels closer than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="OYnGU6"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can save $80 on the Apple Watch Series 6. Normally $400, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 40mm model with GPS for only $320 if you buy the wearable in red&lt;/a&gt;. The sale price on the product listing notes $385, but the retailer will knock an additional $65 off that price at checkout to bring it down to $320. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yssRql"&gt;The Series 6 is currently the flagship watch by Apple and features an always-on display in addition to new sensors that allow users to keep tabs on their blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dyKFO4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IV8gv8"&gt;If you are looking to buy Apple’s most affordable iPad, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737008739520232562#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has a deal on the 128GB storage model, which you can buy for only $380&lt;/a&gt; — $50 off its usual retail price of $430. This iPad model includes a 10.2-inch display, an A12 Bionic processor, a Smart Connector to connect to a Smart Keyboard, and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3b6LRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431710"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5fNuD9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers &lt;/em&gt;is a sequel to the critically acclaimed JRPG game &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with gameplay similar to the &lt;em&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/em&gt; franchise. If you are looking to buy the game on either &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737009243776759335#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737010170367657302#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt;, Best Buy has knocked $20 off its usual retail price, bringing it down to its lowest price yet of $40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdU617"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yy8cIC"&gt;PlayStation Plus is an online subscription service that allows both PS4 and PS5 owners to play games (that are not normally free to play) online. But the service also includes some other incentives, including regular discounts on the PlayStation Store, access to free games each month, and, if you have a PS5, access to the PlayStation Plus Collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhnEpJ"&gt;If you are looking to renew your membership, Eneba is offering a deal to readers of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; based in the US.

    <title>The long overdue Apple TV refresh may offer 120Hz support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/77g2c5m5yj_buMEQU2PmaZt4R9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69081252/akrales_170919_1976_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vSzAlX"&gt;The Apple TV 4K hasn’t been updated for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;more than three and a half years&lt;/a&gt;, which is an eternity in technology. But &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/05/tvos-14-5-beta-code-suggests-120hz-support-coming-to-a-new-apple-tv-model/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the new tvOS 14.5 beta references support for 120Hz refresh rates — a capability that no currently available Apple TV models have — which could indicate Apple is working on a new version of its set-top box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFM1DX"&gt;While it’s not clear what Apple may use a 120Hz refresh rate for in a new Apple TV, one of the more intriguing possibilities is for smoother gaming, like what’s offered with 120Hz support on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Apple has been showing increased interest in gaming as of late, so it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if the new Apple TV had more gaming-focused features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni0cS9"&gt;For example, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad"&gt;just added&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of new games to its Apple Arcade gaming subscription service, which lets you play games on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV and carry your progress across platforms. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;the iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/macos-big-sur-113-adds-fixes-for-ios-apps-on-desktop-support-for-ps5-and-xsx-pads"&gt;macOS 11.3&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1612241720"&gt;tvOS 14.5 betas&lt;/a&gt; also all include support for the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller and the Xbox Series X controller — presumably, that support will carry over to the final software releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3a7Zc"&gt;The rumored 120Hz support for Apple TV would also line up with a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from December&lt;/a&gt;, which said Apple was working on a new Apple TV for sometime this year with a “stronger gaming focus.” (That report also said the new set-top box would have a redesigned remote, which will hopefully be easier to use.) While we don’t know exactly when Apple will announce this rumored device, or if it will announce it at all, if you’re in the market for a new Apple TV, you might want to wait just a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook says Apple wants to use AR to make conversations better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XyXtioEn6PU0aevifVg7fblDyMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076836/dbohn_170912_1993_2091.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wsz98c"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook rarely provides details on unannounced products, but he offered some hints about Apple’s thinking on augmented reality and cars in an interview &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/is-apples-privacy-push-facebooks-existential-threat.html?"&gt;with Kara Swisher for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;this morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtLk2O"&gt;When it comes to augmented reality, he agreed with Swisher’s framing that the tech is “critically important” to Apple’s future and said it could be used to enhance conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aob5ZT"&gt;“You and I are having a great conversation right now. Arguably, it could even be better if we were able to augment our discussion with charts or other things to appear,” Cook said. He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0sM9yy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jVcUXn"&gt;Apple has been rumored for years to be working on an augmented reality headset, and the latest leaks suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;a mixed reality device&lt;/a&gt; could launch next year. Augmented reality features are already available on the iPhone and iPad, but outside of some fun Snapchat filters, augmented reality hasn’t become all that widely used yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlxGHp"&gt;Cook also talked broadly about Apple’s approach to products during a question about cars. Leaks from Apple have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194032/apple-car-self-driving-battery-tech"&gt;made it unclear&lt;/a&gt; if the company is developing self-driving tech that it could license to other companies or if Apple plans to develop an entire car by itself. Cook’s latest comments suggest the latter, assuming the project comes to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4ruuF"&gt;“We love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs,” Cook said. “And so that’s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that’s around that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmCy6m"&gt;Cook referred to “autonomy” as a “core technology” and said there are “lots of things you can do” with it in connection with robots. But he warned that not every Apple project eventually ships. “We investigate so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day,” Cook said. “I’m not saying that one will not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtEzfH"&gt;Swisher also asked Cook about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;Elon Musk’s comments&lt;/a&gt; about a failed attempt to discuss selling Tesla to Apple around 2017. “You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon,” Cook said, “although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change Siri’s voice in the iOS 14.5 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFsYk_I7SRkTLJ2YqLOOcBYLeUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067730/akrales_190522_3444_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvbuiG"&gt;Until recently, the default voice for Apple’s Siri assistant has been stereotypically female-sounding. However, studies have found that having AI assistants default to female-sounding voices can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634322/amazon-alexa-apple-siri-female-voice-assistants-harmful-gender-stereotypes-new-study"&gt;reinforce harmful stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple has tried to fix that in its upcoming iOS 14.5, which is now in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KGYdg"&gt;When you update your phone to iOS 14.5, you’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;prompted to pick a default voice for Siri&lt;/a&gt; — and Apple is including two new voice options. However, if you’ve changed your mind and want to use a different voice (or are using the 14.5 beta and weren’t prompted), this guide will show you how to change the voice after setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhB1LI"&gt;It’s a reasonably simple process. First, go to the Settings app, then to Siri &amp;amp; Search, and tap Siri Voice. There, you’ll be presented with the list of options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/583JirAdCoNcghR8xipu6St_0-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416486/Image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap Siri Voice to be taken to the list of options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mph8AS"&gt;At the moment, the American variety is the only one with four voice choices; Australian, British, Indian, Irish, and South African versions only have two. The four US voice choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yS4oPO"&gt;Voice 1, which is a soft-spoken male-sounding voice &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="swUqtC"&gt;Voice 2, an energetic, confident female-sounding voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6YrCC"&gt;Voice 3 is similar to Voice 2 but male-sounding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OtUBen"&gt;And finally, Voice 4, which is similar to the default Siri voice that’s been around all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tZcBH0"&gt;If you want to hear what the voices sound like for yourself, they’re in the embedded tweet below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ZG9v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Siri's new voice options in the latest iOS 14.5 Beta &lt;a href="https://t.co/25pUA8kP7V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/25pUA8kP7V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1378024607962128384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5h6cp"&gt;Tapping on a voice will play a snippet of it saying “Hi, I’m Siri. Choose the voice you’d like me to use.” If you choose voices 1–3, it will have to download them before you can use them, but you don’t have to stay in the Settings app while it does so. Once it’s finished downloading, Siri will respond with your chosen voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlKF9C"&gt;This process is unlikely to change in the final version, but if it does, we’ll be sure to update this how-to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: WWDC rumors, Clubhouse competition, and the cookiepocalypse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ImdIdIa4RQmHOha3iu0cbhMxLvI=/0x52:1472x1033/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066606/hero_m1_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urvyXL"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obF0zU"&gt;This week, Nilay and Dieter talk with &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;deputy editor Dan Seifert about this week’s rumors about the next big Apple product announcements after invites were sent out for the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22320961/apple-wwdc-2021-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos"&gt;annual WWDC event&lt;/a&gt;, which will again be virtual-only. After more &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/22/kuo-apple-headset-to-have-ultra-short-focal-length-lenses-and-weigh-less-than-150-grams/"&gt;AR headset leaks&lt;/a&gt;, the crew also discusses whether Apple has the bandwidth to support all of its product categories, especially with the Apple TV left alone for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ivet70"&gt;Later in the show, senior reporter Ashley Carman joins to discuss her coverage of social audio platform Clubhouse. Recently, we’ve seen a rise in potential competition in the social audio space from already-established platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505519/slack-instagram-stories-push-to-talk-audio-calls-new-features"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;. Ashley analyzes whether there is a winner-takes-all scenario or a more segmented space dedicated to genres of content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUdJLu"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in the show — like Dieter’s explanation of the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;cookiepocalypse&lt;/a&gt;” brought by Google Chrome’s changes to ad tracking on the browser — so listen to the full discussion here or on your preferred podcast player to hear it all. &lt;/p&gt;
