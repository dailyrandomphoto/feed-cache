    <title>iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements break Face ID unless you can microsolder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Em6G6QkVUlMXgnMLI0x9rZq4sSY=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096270/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSNvSN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 lineup might pack a lot of new features, but they now have a major restriction that makes it much harder for independent repair shops to replace broken screens. If you try to swap the screen, Face ID just won’t work — that is, unless you know how to microsolder and can successfully move a tiny microcontroller from the original screen to a new one, as detailed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22764251%2Fiphone-13-screen-replacements-break-face-id-microsolder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an article from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPfobS"&gt;The change makes a very common replacement much more difficult for independent repair shops that may rely on screen repairs as a significant part of their business. Authorized Apple shops apparently don’t run into the problem, as they have access to software that “can make an iPhone 13 accept a new screen with a few clicks,” according to &lt;em&gt;iFixit.&lt;/em&gt; But many indie shops aren’t part of Apple’s official Independent Repair Provider program, which reportedly has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;invasive terms&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them to have to try and find a way to repair iPhone screens on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDUwr1"&gt;If you want to see just how involved the microcontroller switch is, check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MXlhsThmM"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from iCorrect. The repair is a multi-stage process that looks to take some time and require special equipment. And it’s almost certainly impossible for most iPhone owners to try it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rni2SA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9MXlhsThmM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WmnXtR"&gt;Apple has steadily been pushing people away from repairs done by indie shops through ominous warnings shown after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776965/iphone-xs-max-xr-battery-service-third-party-repair"&gt;battery swaps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884287/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-display-screen-replacement-verification-warning"&gt;screen replacements&lt;/a&gt; for some iPhones. But the situation with Face ID breaking on an iPhone 13 means that people who want a screen repair don’t have many great options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu0v2F"&gt;An authorized repair &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;can be expensive&lt;/a&gt;, as is paying for AppleCare Plus for &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/support/products/iphone/"&gt;reduced screen repair prices&lt;/a&gt;. But when the alternatives include finding an indie shop that has the capability to pull off the delicate microcontroller swap, getting a screen replacement but sacrificing Face ID, or just living with a broken screen, paying up for an authorized repair might feel like the best option, even if it is the worst for your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFfgB9"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will start phasing out mask requirements for US retail store customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask is seen outside an Apple retail store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-grsg9Sg0X49OeTVZzFNyDnb4QQ=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095412/1232558252.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple is reportedly going to lift mask requirements for customers at some of its retail stores in the US. | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I0ozwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning to begin ending mask requirements for customers at some of its US retail stores as early as Friday (via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;). The company told employees about the change in an internal memo on Thursday,&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported, saying the decision was based on a decline in coronavirus cases and a rise in vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVxdeW"&gt;Like many companies with multiple locations, Apple has changed its masking requirements for customers more than once since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic last year. In March 2020, the company closed most of its retail stores &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;as the virus spread&lt;/a&gt;. It began reopening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;some US stores in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with many offering only curbside service and not allowing customers inside. Most stores that did open to customers conducted temperature checks and required customers and employees to wear masks. Apple began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;reopening all its US retail stores in March 2021&lt;/a&gt; as vaccines became more widely available and eased mask requirements for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement"&gt;customers in June&lt;/a&gt; as vaccination rates began to rise, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598686/apple-retail-stores-mask-mandate-requirement"&gt;reinstate them in July&lt;/a&gt; as COVID-19 cases surged once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESRxKQ"&gt;The latest memo states that the updated mask policy will apply to retail customers at more than 100 of Apple’s 270 US stores and will be the same for vaccinated and unvaccinated customers. Mask requirements for Apple retail employees will remain in place, however, and will continue for customers in areas where local governments still require indoor masking. The company added that it will “continue to monitor local guidance and Covid data” throughout the coming holiday season and adjust as conditions warrant, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAiyqz"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The secrets of the first real smartphone, with Dieter Bohn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pB7XzuuQ2W_dyBR9idwQ47ncnxY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092618/Springboard_Thumb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Our new documentary now streaming on your TV&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7F1VU7"&gt;You may have read on the site that &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn has been working on a documentary called &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone. &lt;/em&gt;It’s about a company called Handspring working on, you guessed it, a very early smartphone. It’s a story that I think will resonate with the Decoder audience, so I wanted to sit down with Dieter and talk about it. He even brought an exclusive clip that didn’t make it into the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgNd0U"&gt;That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone"&gt;documentary is streaming now on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s new streaming apps&lt;/a&gt; that you can get on your TV or set-top box. We have them for Android, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Apple TV. We’ve been working on these for a long time. It’s a little more complicated than you might think to make these apps, make them good, and distribute them on everyone’s app stores. We learned a lot about usage rights and rival closed caption formats — we ran into some real Decoder pain points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZJPPa"&gt;But apps are cool, and you can watch your videos in 4K. You can also listen to this very podcast on our fancy streaming apps on your TV with glorious surround sound. And we’re going to start doing some exclusive videos on the platform, including the one I mentioned up top: a documentary that Dieter and our video team made over many months called &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DdqGhl"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP9354497182" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDHy32"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMNSyG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter Bohn, you’re the executive editor at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; tell me about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5UidF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a company called Handspring. This was one of the very early companies to try and make one of the very first smartphones. It had a storied legacy, it had genius founders, and it had a nonstop stream of corporate catastrophes that prevented it from being successful. The long and the short is the story of innovation and a scrappy startup trying to do something incredibly ambitious, but there were many reasons why it was not destined to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Alrqqg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We call it a scrappy startup, and it mostly was a scrappy startup, but at one point, it was one of the most successful and fastest-growing tech companies in America and American business history.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbGWff"&gt;That’s right. So the CEO was Donna Dubinsky, and they had launched the Palm Pilot, which you have probably heard of. And through a series of corporate acquisitions, they ended up being stuck at a modem company called 3Com. So they spun out and started Handspring and convinced 3Com to license Palm OS to them. And they launched the Visor, a PDA, and it was wildly successful, relative to other PDAs on the market. So they had a huge, huge initial rush of interest and sales, and things were rocking and rolling pretty fast for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VXXCaL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Handspring Trailer|104173" data-volume-uuid="89d04bab1" data-volume-id="104173" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-485" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xeat29"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They were early to the idea of a smartphone, and the thing they wanted to make was a smartphone. They had some major challenges on the technical side of building a smartphone that early. It seems like their bigger challenges were just finding a market, finding the right people who could sell this thing to other people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx9byV"&gt;The really interesting thing about the technical challenge, in particular, is the parts didn’t exist. They wanted to make a smartphone that had a radio that could handle data, and they just couldn’t buy it. It did not exist. The entire infrastructure of factories and supply chains that now exist in Shenzhen and Vietnam and wherever didn’t. So they ended up finding one company, I believe it might have been in France, that happened to make the radios that they needed. And they just had to cobble stuff together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPYumX"&gt;They also had to make bets on what actual radio networks would exist because there were all sorts of weird pager networks and other data networks. So they got through those problems, but then the question becomes, “How do we sell this thing?” And selling phones direct to consumer was not a real viable business. Everything went through the carriers. Before the iPhone, the carriers had absolute control over phones, not just which phones they decided to sell or not sell, but how they worked and what they were allowed to do from a capability perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNjFDj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the thing I end up talking about on Decoder a lot: the best products don’t always win, and there are often gatekeepers, visible or invisible, that are actually shaping the market. Even though they had the best phone in this very early category, they were gatekept out of the market in various ways, but it was still popular. People were still covering it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22278890/jon-fortt-cnbc-anchor-interview-gamestop-stock-wallstreetbets-reddit"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Fort, who has been on Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, he’s now an anchor at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, he was a cub reporter at the San Jose Mercury News at the time, and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is full of clips of his byline as a newspaper reporter. There was a lot of attention being paid to this company. Why were they not able to overcome those gatekeepers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldyhTK"&gt;A lot of it was those gatekeepers were more powerful than they were. Maybe not today, but there was a period after the iPhone where you could get something out to the market without having too much carrier interference. And Handspring did not live in that world whatsoever. They had a hard time getting the phone to sell in some European markets because it didn’t have a 10-key keyboard. The carriers didn’t believe that QWERTY keyboards would be popular and sell. Sprint did not believe that anybody would want to send a picture on their phone. They didn’t want that to happen because other phones couldn’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgnoQ5"&gt;But Handspring also faced a bunch of external problems. They made a huge deal to get a huge office building right after the market crashed. And that market crash caused all sorts of other problems for them, including an excess inventory problem from Palm, which ended up forcing the prices down on all PDAs. So their cash cow that was funding the launch of this phone went away. They were also constantly in the precipice of running out of cash, running out of resources. And they were on that precipice while everybody around them was actively fighting the success of this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fKBssm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone is out now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6PrU8F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ideas that happened at Handspring, that company was reacquired by Palm, and then Palm did a bunch of stuff, those ideas are sort of everywhere in computing now. Where are the people? The people had long careers after the Handspring collapse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELKorP"&gt;A few of the key characters, Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky, went off to do the thing that Jeff always wanted to do in the first place. For Jeff, smartphones and PDAs was always a side hustle. His real interest is in brain research and trying to figure out how neuroscience and the brain works. And he has some unique theories on that. He finally went off and founded this company called Numenta, and a bunch of the Handspring people came along with him because they all really enjoyed working together. So they’re still over there doing that. Other players went to other places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oTke5"&gt;One thing that’s interesting, this isn’t quite a Handspring thing, but you can follow some of the software history from Palm over to this other company, Palm Source, all the way to some of the founding team for Android. So it wasn’t just the Sidekick team that came over [to Android]; it was also a bunch of expats from Palm Source that originally were trying to bring Palm OS into the future that ended up writing some of the foundations for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhsTvP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just to be clear, the Android project at Google was an acquisition. If you remember the T-Mobile Sidekick, which was a phenomenon for a hot minute, the team that made the Sidekick founded a company called Android. Google bought that company, and they brought over a bunch of ex-Palm people as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0HulD"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jb1oI5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that was the beginning of Android. That theme of “you have ideas, you get them wrong, you keep working at them, ultimately some combination of wireless carriers crushes you out of existence” is a pattern that repeats over and over again. But you can see the lineage is right there, and some of the core ideas of how you would operate a phone that connected to a network and was also a computer started at Palm in a very real way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="tw8kBS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eGzsbI"&gt;One of the people we interviewed is Rob Haitani, who was the interface designer for Palm OS and later at Handspring. He was trying to convince these software engineers, “This is how you make mobile software.” In the ’90s, no one knew how to make a mobile app. So he would have to be really rigorous about, “No, no, fewer tabs and big buttons. And it needs to be understandable. It has to fit in 160 by 160 pixels.” By the way, this was the screen resolution on these devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4J4Et"&gt;He got so tired of explaining how mobile worked to people, so he finally wrote a book that was based on the ideas that got attributed to him. It was called the Zen of Palm, and he had all these cones. So an example was how do you fit a mountain into a teacup? And software engineers would say, “I don’t know, you something, something, something.” “No, you don’t. You just find the diamond. That’s the one that goes in the teacup. That’s the only thing you care about. That’s what goes in your mobile app. Everything else can get buried in a menu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8ClGR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m very confident lots of product managers listen to the show, I hear from you. We live in a world where a lot of this stuff is organized through our systems or competing philosophies of product design and product management. At that point in time, they were just very nascent. It was the beginning of thinking about how to architect computing systems and interfaces, and [Palm and Handspring] invented a lot of this stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHRVmt"&gt;There were competing visions, to be clear. I mean, Pocket PC was a thing, WIN CE, I guess technically we’re talking about, which was a very Windows-esque interface. It had a start button, a literal tiny start button in the lower left-hand corner. And of course, Apple famously made the Newton, and that didn’t go so hot because it was also a little bit overloaded. There was General Magic — everyone has probably heard of that story as well. That was also overloaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTJAj4"&gt;One of the things that Palm figured out was you need to make the simplest possible app that can do the stuff that you want and don’t do more than that. They had an aggressive willingness to say “no,” and they were one of the first tech companies making consumer products who really evangelized the idea that you say “no” before you say “yes.” That hones your product to achieving the things that you want it to do and allows it to do those specific things very well. And then, you can start growing and making it into a more general-purpose platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7vM8D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you mentioned Apple, and that idea about saying no is sort of indelibly associated with Apple and Steve jobs now. There is some connectivity between Apple and the Palm story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9jbD1"&gt;Donna Dubinsky used to work for Steve Jobs. Ed Colligan, who ran marketing and later on became CEO of Palm, also worked for Apple for a time. So they had relationships with Steve Jobs. More than once, there would be a phone call where it’s like, “Is this phone call about Apple maybe buying Palm or Handspring?” Maybe it is, maybe it’s not. And the pivot point of the &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; documentary is this meeting where Jeff, Donna, and Ed went to speak to Steve Jobs about getting the Mac to support their Visor PDA. Steve Jobs didn’t believe in the PDA. He didn’t believe in their vision. And Steve Jobs tried to present his idea of the digital hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ii1brk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is this phone call about Apple maybe buying Palm or Handspring?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X0wxKk"&gt;If you remember, he had the Mac at the center of it, and he thought everything was going to circle around the Mac. And Jeff Hawkins said, “No, Steve, I think you’re wrong.” And right next to Steve’s chart on the whiteboard, he drew his own chart with a phone at the center of it. This was well before Apple had been talking about the iPhone at all. And it may be that this was one of the things that convinced Apple, and Steve Jobs in particular, to get serious about coming back to the idea of mobile after walking away from the Newton because that had been such a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZmGnx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Famously Ed Colligan, who was running Palm, said, “The PC guys are not just going to walk in and figure this out.” It’s quoted everywhere, and I know that you tried to actually get this audio, unsuccessfully. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQEoaG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the time that Apple was introducing the iPhone and other big companies were introducing their phones. You talked to him about that quote.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZI79z"&gt;Yes, I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dnnuF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It turns out at least one PC company figured it out. The other ones did not, but you talked to him about that quote. This is a little extra, it’s not in the documentary, but it’s just so fascinating to me. What did he say when you asked him about that quote?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oT6lCx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The PC guys are not just going to walk in and figure this out.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aKKhTR"&gt;You’re right, it didn’t make it into the documentary because explaining the context around the quote was too complicated. He said it ahead of the iPhone announcement, but everyone knew the iPhone was coming. It was at a Churchill Club breakfast, and his contention is that he was speaking about the PC industry in general and that making phones was very hard. He knew just as well as anybody because they had been trying to make a smartphone before supply chains for any of these parts even existed. And he also understood, based on his history with Palm, that people had been trying to shrink PC interfaces into tiny mobile interfaces for a while. And that was the wrong idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vNTfi"&gt;So his contention is that he wasn’t speaking specifically about just Apple. He was talking in general about PC people coming in and trying to make phones. So here’s what he said about his famous quote when I interviewed him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="77uNk9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Colligan:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s pretty silly, because if people actually go back and look at that interview, they’ll see that it was probably an hour long. And I thought it was really great, which is one of the sad things about it, that this one thing came out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHHXdx"&gt;But you know, what I meant by that [quote] I think was taken out of context. First of all, I’ve been an Apple proponent for my entire life. My entire career has been built on Apple products. My first company was an accessory company for Apple. My second company was an accessory company for Apple. Radius was an accessory company for Apple. So I’m a huge Apple guy and I always have been, so I wouldn’t disparage them. So when I use [the phrase] PC guys, if I was using that term, it probably was about HP, Compact, Dell, and whoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUxowr"&gt;But even if Apple is included in that grouping, what I meant was that these are hard devices to create. And to really nail it, especially the radio side, it’s going to take some real effort. I didn’t say it was impossible. I just said it’s not going to be super simple. And in fact, if people look back at the original iPhone, it was actually a pretty horrible phone, day one. And it did take some iteration for it to get right. Now they had enough other compelling elements around it that people overlooked that, to a large sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2YO51"&gt;So they did really well. And I never, in my wildest dreams, would say Apple can’t create a product in this space. I would’ve never said that and I would’ve never felt that, but I probably just was saying, “Hey, this is a hard business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PHFIM7"&gt;You can judge whether or not he was right about that, but I think that, in general, the PC company that figured it out was Apple, and a bunch of the others kind of didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uR6xLy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bunch of them didn’t. Most of them didn’t. Microsoft didn’t. And that, to me, is the overall lesson here: you can have the idea early, you can even try to copy the idea, but actually executing the idea is extremely difficult. And one of the themes of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that is very resonant to me is that these things are very fragile, especially when they’re early. And the success actually might not be market success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxLfGu"&gt;The subtitle for &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;. We’re aware that Sidekick exists. We’re aware that Symbian was around. But Handspring had the vision for the way that phones should work today, and it was the clearest vision at the time, but that was not enough. You need to understand what the forces are that will prevent your vision from happening. And some of those forces are more than just “can you get the parts?” “Can you build a good product?” Some of it’s stuff like the carriers, stuff like “does the supply chain exist?” And so on. We talk about product fit. That’s a shorthand for a much bigger conversation of what could prevent your good idea from becoming a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5aWQk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This feels like a good place to stop and tell people to go watch this documentary, which is excellent. We premiered it at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s 10th-anniversary event to rapturous applause in the room — which was pretty cool. You can go visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/springboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;theverge.com/springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. It has the trailer; it has the information about all the apps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLyS2p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will just remind everyone again, we have new &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; streaming TV apps on Android, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Apple TV. Just go into the search box, type in “The Verge,” download the app, watch Springboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQVhSl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter, congratulations. It’s a great documentary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="go97WQ"&gt;Hey, thanks. Talk to you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google outlines plans for first alternative in-app payments in South Korea</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vdqEYoYCJQymuPY-gh5wkaWwAA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092299/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KznApg"&gt;Google has announced changes it will make to its in-app payments options in South Korea — a significant step back for the tech giant as governments around the world seek to curb the control Google and Apple wield over their mobile ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgBKo0"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Google says it will allow third-party payment options for in-app purchases to appear alongside its own Google Play billing system in Android apps. The company will still charge developers a commission if users pay using a third-party system, but this fee will be reduced slightly as compensation for the costs of supporting alternative payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93UEyw"&gt;Says Google: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WStgSE"&gt;Service fees for distributing apps via Android and Google Play will continue to be based on digital sales on the platform. We recognize, however, that developers will incur costs to support their billing system, so when a user selects alternative billing, we will reduce the developer’s service fee by 4%. For example, for the vast majority of developers who pay 15% for transactions through Google Play’s billing system, their service fee for transactions through the alternate billing system would be 11%. As another example, certain categories of apps participating in our Media Experience Program, such as an eBooks provider, will pay a 10% service fee for transactions made via Google Play’s billing system, but only 6% for transactions on an alternative system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Md7378"&gt;Google says this approach will allow it to comply with South Korean law while still investing in the Google Play ecosystem (the company’s long-standing argument for why it charges developers up to 30 percent commission on in-app purchases in the first place). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_UvLzeePFsu2PmO0m742uqL8C-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985218/google_alternative_payments.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An illustration of how Google might allow alternative payment methods to be integrated into Android apps. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IIoxjW"&gt;Google is making these changes in response to specific legislation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passed in South Korea last August&lt;/a&gt;. The bill, dubbed the “Google power-abuse-prevention law” by some in the South Korean media, is intended to stop the operators of large app stores (aka Google and Apple) from requiring developers to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; use their own payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDlXvU"&gt;The bill is the first of its kind to mandate such changes in Android and iOS, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;similar legislation&lt;/a&gt; has been considered in the US and Europe. In the US, the issue of Apple and Google collecting commissions on in-app purchases was contentious enough to spark the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;recent lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic and Apple, though Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;largely won&lt;/a&gt; that legal tussle. (Epic also has an ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;lawsuit against Google&lt;/a&gt; regarding the same issue.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vphowk"&gt;Apple itself is not making any changes to its mobile payment structure in South Korea in response to this legislation. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-allows-alternate-in-app-payment-options-in-south-korea-though-familiar-fees-remain-11636021788?mod=e2tw"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company has told the South Korean government that its current policies are in line with the law. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes that the exact wording of the legislation may allow for some wiggle-room for Apple. The law doesn’t directly regulate commissions but says that apps must not be forced to choose a specific payment method because of “unreasonable fees.” Apple, presumably, will argue that its fees are not unreasonable. If the government agency in charge of implementing this law, the Korea Communications Commission, disagrees, then it can open an investigation into Apple’s practices which may lead to fines for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on an iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MZkS02gRzr7f1BK84MZY4HSji1w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087981/akrales_210917_4760_0361.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Stupd"&gt;More and more official papers are being turned into PDF documents, and you may be asked to sign one electronically while you’re away from your computer (here, by the way, is how to sign a PDF document using a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323097/pdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323097/pdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re using an iPhone, it’s actually not all that difficult; you can create a signature and reuse it by using the iPhone’s built-in Markup tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRNifU"&gt;Here’s what to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lMxrqY"&gt;Open the PDF document in Markup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VujaGy"&gt;Tap the plus sign at the bottom right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wiXtpr"&gt;Tap on the Signature button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0EwA9i"&gt;If you haven’t created any signatures yet, tap on the label at the top titled “New Signature.” (If you don’t see “New Signature,” tap the plus sign in the upper left corner.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Markup, tap on the plus and then the Signature button." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRS3AJXiLlTB2Xs-qRejNFZFz4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983485/IMG_AA00365EEDAD_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Markup, tap on the plus and then the Signature button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can label your saved signature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VYv-trmKLqK75dLdB4Ky3LZ8KTM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983494/IMG_68BC3F57889A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can label your saved signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5WufAk"&gt;You’ll be given the option of labeling your new signature with your full name, family name, nickname, etc. Or you can choose not to have a label at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nu2PJP"&gt;Once you’ve chosen your label, you can then sign your name at the bottom of the screen. There is a “Clear” button if you decide you need to try more than once to get it right. Tap “Done” at the top right corner when you’re ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MjSXxO"&gt;Your signature will then appear in a box on your document. You can move it and / or resize it until you’re happy with how it looks on the document. When you’re ready, tap anywhere outside the box. You can then use Markup for any other edits. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Draw your signature; tap “Clear” if its not to your liking." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t2afLYe2GLP3hrMm_21MgAQ7RKY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983496/IMG_1685F699DBDE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Draw your signature; tap “Clear” if its not to your liking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Move the completed signature to where you want it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yyYFi8hvsHWs1juWmzlhtkJ_ngc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983500/IMG_4E10B05B0701_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move the completed signature to where you want it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qkO4Dd"&gt;When you’re ready, tap “Done” in the upper left corner and save the file.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FYj2EX"&gt;The next time you open a PDF in Markup on your phone, tap on the Signature button, and the signature (or signatures) that you saved will be there. Just tap on it, and it will be dropped into your document. You can always select “Add or Remove Signature” if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>‘Sideloading is a cyber criminal’s best friend,’ according to Apple’s software chief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVyvU_-XAFY6dXHoDdqHGFmPB2Q=/64x0:706x428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087804/Screen_Shot_2021_11_03_at_9.59.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DdARwO"&gt;“Sideloading is a cyber criminal’s best friend and requiring that on iPhone would be a gold rush for the malware industry,” according to Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi, who delivered a dramatic speech at &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwstKnhWs6k"&gt;Web Summit 2021&lt;/a&gt; declaiming the security risks if Apple were required to let users sideload apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M23152"&gt;Federighi, who oversees Apple’s iOS and macOS software divisions, was specifically protesting the &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en"&gt;European Commission’s proposed Digital Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;, which, if passed, would require Apple to let users install apps outside of the iOS App Store. According to Federighi, the lack of sideloading is what separates Apple’s relatively low rate of malware on iOS from the “5 million Android attacks per month,” and that if Apple were forced to let users install their own apps, “the floodgates are open for malware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFEnxF"&gt;Federighi also argues against a popular proposed solution of letting users decide for themselves whether to take the risk of sideloading apps. The problem is that “criminals are clever, and they’re really good at hiding in plain sight,” and that even informed users might get caught by misleading websites, or even get stuck with fake app stores installed on their phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jUn5TT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is still very much against sideloading&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llCjh0"&gt;And even if &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, a tech-savvy smartphone expert, might not be fooled, Federighi plays on the heartstrings and asks the audience to think of the children or parents who might be fooled. “The fact that anyone can be harmed by malware isn’t something that we should stand for,” Federighi concludes, despite the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;Apple still routinely deals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;with multimillion-dollar scams&lt;/a&gt; that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;only just added the ability to report&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7BA5H"&gt;Federighi’s picture of doom doesn’t just stop there, though: he also raises the concern that if Apple were to allow sideloading, “some social networking apps will probably try to avoid the pesky privacy protections of the App Store and only make their apps available via sideloading.” According to Federighi, Apple’s privacy requirements in the App Store go beyond those of the letter of the law, and social media companies looking to escape those could force customers to choose between “losing touch with your friends online, or taking on the risks of sideloading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmjV5j"&gt;“Sideloading undermines security and puts people’s data at risk,” according to Federighi, and that if customers and regulators want the option to sideload apps, the alternative of Android should be enough to meet that without requiring it for iPhones. But all the concerns on iOS are curious, given the other half of his job description: leading the macOS software team, where apps can be freely installed outside of Apple’s app store (and have been for decades) without suffering from apocalyptic malware attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azTcgJ"&gt;If Apple wanted, it could enable iOS sideloading in a similar manner and require something like the Gatekeeper system on macOS, which allows for Apple to check signed developer IDs to confirm the software is genuine. It’s an argument that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667256/apple-vs-epic-trail-judge-craig-federighi-macos-security-arguments-iphone-ios-response"&gt;noted as well during the Apple / Epic trial&lt;/a&gt;, commenting that Federighi may be “stretching the truth” on Mac malware concerns and that Apple could likely make a similar system work on iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElfKnD"&gt;And most notably, Federighi’s speech completely ignores the fact that by requiring all apps to be installed through the App Store, it forces all app commerce to flow through the App Store, too — where Apple collects its highly contested 30 percent cut, to the tune of billions of dollars every year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s colorful HomePod Minis are a fun addition to your smart home decor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wy-pGeNtFTeKSbgtMx2DlUJupc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087598/jtuohy_211102_4860_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini now comes in three new color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eaq9PQ"&gt;Three colorful HomePod Minis were announced last month and went on sale this week, adding yellow, orange, and blue options to our smart speaker home decor selections. I got to try out the trio of bright speakers, and have to say I quite like adding a pop of color to my smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yq3o9S"&gt;Apple is a bit behind the ball here; both Google and Amazon have had color choices for their smart speakers for a while now. The Nest Minis come in coral and light blue colors, and Amazon’s Echo speakers have blue, tiger orange, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688035/billie-eilish-echo-studio-price-release-date-preorder"&gt;Billie Eilish-beige&lt;/a&gt; options. But as usual, Apple has gone the extra mile with its design here, creating something quite genuinely delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0A7k9z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844191"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PatSkt"&gt;Each $99 HomePod Mini comes with a matching colored box and a different shimmering, shimmying Mini logo, presumably mimicking the sounds your HomePod will deliver courtesy of that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734185/new-apple-music-voice-plan-price-features-app"&gt;Apple Music Voice subscription&lt;/a&gt; you’re planning to use it with (right?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDj2ub"&gt;The braided USB-C power cable (which still can’t be removed) is color-coordinated with the speaker and is a pastel version of the main event. The volume up and down buttons on the white control plate perfectly match the Mini’s color. Also — and this is very Apple — when you set up the Mini using your iPhone, the graphic that pops up matches the color of the Mini you’re pairing (actually useful when you are setting up three different colors at once).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9IiJJ3GuT9P9EWnmpUzMpvklfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982938/jtuohy_211102_4860_0030.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each pod comes with matching control buttons and a color-coordinated cord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UQlyvd"&gt;Speaking of those colors, they are a lot more impressive in person. When they were first announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22723141/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-price-release-date-features"&gt;Apple’s fall hardware event&lt;/a&gt;, my initial thought was they were a bit underwhelming. Orange and yellow aren’t top of mind when it comes to interior design color choices, although they are great for the odd “pop” of color. And the blue looked so dark as to not be that dissimilar to the existing dark grey option. Also, where were the green and red, Apple?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G0DJJsvzAD8e8HxGqd7Jz5S6H4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982935/jtuohy_211102_4860_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was able to color coordinate my Samsung Frame TV with the new HomePod Minis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XnnwlC"&gt;Once I got my hands on the speakers, though, and tried them out in a few different situations around the house, I found I had plenty of spots where they could fit right in. Although, admittedly, it was primarily in my children’s rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ7zkr"&gt;The yellow is very bright, definitely lemon on the color wheel, and the orange has a much more blood orange, reddish hue — closer to coral than the fruit Florida is famous for. However, next to a coral-colored Nest Mini, it pops a bit more and there is no hint of pink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15q4S8AN58suscRPYdvrOSbmvoE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982926/jtuohy_211102_4860_0008_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6l95h9MpukTcMRY9-UgFOqiIG74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982930/jtuohy_211102_4860_0010_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vvkDsR_QJ_Bd_NjyVoX4ORrWdxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982928/jtuohy_211102_4860_0009_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j09WB9IEkMSbLvpBZWkIAnxX2pQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982933/jtuohy_211102_4860_0014.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orange, yellow, blue, and the threesome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YlfJU2"&gt;The blue is my favorite (likely because I just redid my kitchen and chose dark blue cabinets, so it is the perfect fit there). It’s a deeply rich, almost royal blue and really pretty. The blue also doesn’t show as much shadow through the mesh, something that gives the brighter colors a bit of a muddy look when you get up close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ni8BjgsqbkTC-EyualirjXAqp7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982941/jtuohy_211102_4860_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The blue HomePod Mini is a perfect match in my kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gKIuIj"&gt;One advantage of these colors, and the dark grey option, over the white Mini, is they are less likely to start greying as they collect dust and dirt, something that’s been noticeable on the white version in my testing. Clearly, we need a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;special Apple cleaning cloth&lt;/a&gt; for our HomePods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utt0Bb"&gt;The new HomePod Minis are identical in function to the existing models. They work with Siri, can use your iPhone to make calls and send messages, act as a hub for your HomeKit home, and set alarms and timers. We will be testing them out shortly though, to explore some of the features added since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;our first review&lt;/a&gt;. They ship with software version 15.0, so you will need to upgrade to 15.1.1 out of the box to take advantage of new features such as spatial audio and lossless music with Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s 11-inch Max Plus iPad keyboard is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wbnJyj0hA9CRKotgVWZESUMN71c=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086425/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brydge 11 Max Plus keyboard with an 11-inch iPad Pro in it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PWj0BD"&gt;Following the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22553643/brydge-12-9-max-plus-review-price-shipping"&gt;12.9-inch Max Plus keyboard for the iPad&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Brydge is now releasing an 11-inch version. The new, smaller keyboard has all of the same features as its bigger sibling, including Brydge’s new magnetic mounting system and Instant-On Bluetooth tech, but is sized to fit all generations of the 11-inch iPad Pro and the fourth-generation of the 10.5-inch iPad Air. It’s available starting today, November 3rd, from both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-max-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D39674056966249&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759698%2Fbrydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brydge’s online store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NYS8O1M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $199.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR0P3l"&gt;Despite its smaller size, the 11-inch Max Plus’ pitch is exactly the same as the 12.9-inch model’s: it’s meant to provide a MacBook-like experience with an iPad. That includes a full keyboard layout with a function row, plus a large trackpad that supports multitouch gestures and navigation. The aluminum chassis can be purchased in either a dark gray or a silver finish to match your iPad’s color, and it has a very MacBook-like appearance when the iPad is installed in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AxoD1EnoshadMbeA7wjhr95UBKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980077/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back panel of the 11 Max Plus is plastic and has tabs to easily pop the iPad off of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sq5nntfMZ3aBYNgydxlj_THVy00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980078/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Max Plus connects to the iPad’s built-in magnets to hold it in place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7ayvW"&gt;The big new innovation with the Max Plus line is the magnetic attachment system, which eschews the clamps Brydge used in older designs for a full backplate that connects to the magnets inside the iPad to hold it in place. The advantage here is that it allows you to quickly remove the iPad from the keyboard and use it handheld and just as easily snap it back into place when you want to use the keyboard again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p84uXJ"&gt;The Max Plus does not use the iPad’s Smart Connector, relying instead on a Bluetooth connection with the tablet. To overcome the usual delays that happen when using a Bluetooth keyboard with an iPad, Brydge developed its Instant-On technology, which allows the keyboard to stay connected to the iPad for up to four hours, even if it isn’t being used, without detrimental battery drain on either the case or the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7G61ky"&gt;This makes waking up the iPad feel much the same as a directly connected keyboard and mitigates one of the major complaints with Bluetooth. Brydge claims up to three months of battery life between charges, but that varies greatly on how much you utilize the three-level backlight. In the week or so I’ve been testing the product, I’ve not had to charge it back up once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ax7BVZ"&gt;Brydge CEO Nick Smith tells me that the company’s inspiration for the keyboard feel was the vaunted 2015 MacBook Pro. As a result, the Max Plus keys have a bit more travel than either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard case&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547938/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-air-fourth-generation"&gt;Logitech’s Combo Touch&lt;/a&gt;, the two main competitors in this space. The keycaps themselves are also a little smaller and have a little bit more space between them, but I had no trouble getting comfortable with the layout after a few minutes of use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n88GEQqlJgIPgnFRtSS2HfnuTE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980079/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Max Plus has a full keyboard with function row and a large multitouch trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NzwXx3"&gt;Brydge is also very proud of the size of the trackpad it was able to include with the Max Plus; the 11-inch model has a larger trackpad than either Apple or Logitech’s keyboard. It supports multitouch gestures and has good tracking, if not quite as precise as Apple has in the Magic Keyboard. Due to the smaller size of the 11-inch’s deck, I did have a few instances of palm rejection, which caused my cursor to jump across the screen when I didn’t expect it to. But otherwise, the trackpad experience on the Max Plus is quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxdnmp"&gt;Using the Max Plus keyboard is a different experience than the Magic Keyboard or the Combo Touch, by design. It’s a chunkier, heftier product, adding nearly two pounds of weight to the iPad itself, but it’s more stable on a lap, like you’d expect a laptop to be. It’s also more comfortable to type on for longer periods because the deck provides more room to rest your hands. And the full function row is a boon compared to the Magic Keyboard, which requires reaching up to use the iPad’s buttons or touch the screen anytime you want to adjust brightness or volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPwJcz"&gt;Lastly, because the Max Plus uses a Bluetooth connection, you can remove the iPad from the case and still use the keyboard and trackpad with it. I particularly liked putting the iPad in a portrait orientation when working on a long document, which you can’t do with the Magic Keyboard or the Combo Touch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eZo1MBkMOokkxIqaaoS6YU9rVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980081/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When closed, the 11 Max Pro is chunkier than other keyboards, but preserves the MacBook-like aesthetic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qrsgNm"&gt;The Max Plus is also not designed to provide much in the way of protection. Unlike Logitech’s Combo Touch, when you remove it from the keyboard, you’re holding a bare iPad, and it doesn’t provide any corner protection from drops. If you are looking for a more protective design that has similar traits as the Max Plus, Brydge offers the plastic &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-air-max-plus%3Fvariant%3D39421148594281&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759698%2Fbrydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Air Max Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which provides four feet of drop protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoEeWd"&gt;At $200, the Max Plus undercuts Apple by about $100 and is priced similarly to the Combo Touch. It’s not a budget product by any means; that’s reflected in the copious amount of aluminum used and the long feature list. But if you’re looking for a way to get more out of your 11-inch iPad Pro or iPad Air and want a more traditional experience than Apple’s keyboard provides, there’s a lot to like here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Tis’ the season for AirPods discounts galore. Last week, Apple finally launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third generation of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a new AirPods lineup and dropping the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level AirPods from $159 to $129. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are also just around the corner, meaning many retailers are also starting to discount the AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and even the aforementioned third-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hV5pag"&gt;Even this far ahead of the shopping holiday, there are sizable discounts to be had on the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TaIhNe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Which AirPods model should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. Moreover, it only sells the model with a wired charging case, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. What’s great, though, is that this version frequently gets discounted, so you can buy it for even less. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $120 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0HdVMNz%253A%253AT00%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0HdVMNz%253A%253AT00%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747976896193620917" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;Although you can’t buy them from Apple, you can still also buy the entry-level AirPods with a wireless charging case elsewhere, which you can charge via a Qi wireless pad or a Lightning cable. Right now, you can get a pair for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0Hf3UNz%253A%253AT00%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0Hf3UNz%253A%253AT00%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; instead of their typical $199 list price. However, given the latest AirPods — which we’ll dive into just a minute — cost $30 extra and come with MagSafe support along with other perks, it may not be worth buying this model unless you’re truly strapped for cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;As previously mentioned, the newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems allow for a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model. Deals are currently hard to come by on the third-gen model given how recently they launched, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling them right now for $175. It’s a small discount, but also their lowest price yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="qBADDX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and comes with swappable silicone tips. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently received a firmware&lt;/a&gt; update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Additionally, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These start at $249, but you can buy them right now for $190 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you prefer, you can also purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;older version&lt;/a&gt; without MagSafe compatibility — which still supports Qi-compatible wireless chargers — for a discounted $175 at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max have been discounted to $449 at Amazon in the past month, there are currently no sales that deep to speak of. The Max are, however, currently available in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThsYtSLBr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $479, one of their better prices in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now, technically, build your own USB-C iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ldEp4WZoNnialYf5G-AJwwWJ08=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70081607/usbciphone.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUhqOu"&gt;Robotics engineering student Ken Pillonel wowed the internet last month with a wild hack that managed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722123/first-iphone-usb-c-port-robotics-engineering-student-custom"&gt;put a working USB-C port&lt;/a&gt; inside an iPhone X for a fully functional USB-C iPhone. And now, Pillonel has published a far more detailed video showing just how he managed to pull off the hack, &lt;a href="https://github.com/kenp-io/not-for-iphone-usb-c/tree/master/ip-x"&gt;along with a Github repository&lt;/a&gt; with technical details, CNC instructions, and information on the custom PCB that he designed for anyone brave enough to try and put together a similar hack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiIyLz"&gt;The 13-minute-long video shows off the nitty-gritty of Pillonel’s mod, which is simple in theory: combining a Lightning to USB-C connection together in a daisy chain to mimic a proper USB-C port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="brDvJQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVEQJNRmfDQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cumahx"&gt;The video shows off virtually the whole development process. It’s quite a journey, going from proof of concept prototypes, reverse engineering the Lightning connector (and eventually, reverse engineering a fake Lightning connector), ordering a custom flexible circle board, and machining the iPhone’s case to fit the physically larger USB-C connector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEhnb7"&gt;The video also shows off just how difficult it was to fit the extra circuitry, with the board bending around both sides of Apple’s Taptic Engine hardware to squeeze in all the necessary components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOKSKv"&gt;Pillonel is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F165161363347&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22759704%2Fusb-c-iphone-hack-mod-open-source-github-repo-ken-pillonel-design-video" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;auctioning off his original prototype&lt;/a&gt; on eBay, where bidding has already reached $3,400 as of the time of publishing this piece, for anyone with deep pockets that’s interested in a USB-C iPhone of their own. Pillonel does note that whoever does buy the phone shouldn’t restore, update, or erase it, open it, or “use it as your daily phone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQr8ch"&gt;Lastly, Pillonel has made the whole project open source so that others can build on his existing work, whether that’s making more custom USB-C iPhone X models or porting the design to other iPhones down the line (although the full PCB design won’t be posted until after the auction finished). He also notes that he plans to continue to build on the design, with goals for improving fast-charging, waterproofing, and even enabling USB-C accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGSJs6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
