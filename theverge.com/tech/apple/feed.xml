    <title>Apple lawsuit over ‘buy’ and ‘rent’ labels for digital content can continue, rules federal judge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fq0LmCW3roSsZeMH42Rdq4LXNcA=/42x0:1590x1032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174133/apple_previews_macos_catalina_apple_music_screen_06032019.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZAqtTC"&gt;A federal judge has rejected a motion by Apple to dismiss a putative class action lawsuit over the company’s use of the labels “buy” and “rent” when selling digital content. As first covered by &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/apple-must-face-lawsuit-for-telling-consumers-they-can-buy-movies-tv-shows"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the suit can now continue, though could yet be settled before ever reaching trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnmeP6"&gt;The lead plaintiff in the case, David Andino, argues that Apple is misleading consumers when it tells them it can “buy” digital versions of albums, TV shows, and films from its stores. Why? Because the iPhone-maker retains the power to terminate customers’ access to this content whenever it likes. This can happen, for example, when the company loses distribution rights to content that users haven’t secured by downloading to their device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HAO8ke"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just like Best Buy cannot come into a person’s home to repossess [your] DVD”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M0ptNB"&gt;“Just like Best Buy cannot come into a person’s home to repossess the movie DVD that such person purchased from it, defendant should not be able to remove, or permit the removal by others of, digital content from its customers,” says Andino’s &lt;a href="http://casefilingsalert.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Apple-Video-Content.pdf"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. “Though some consumers may get lucky and never lose access to any of their paid for media, others may one day find that their digital content is now gone forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7Oc68"&gt;Apple attempted to have the case dismissed, but a ruling this week by US District Court Judge John Mendez shows that the company’s arguments weren’t entirely convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WA5YOC"&gt;“Apple contends that ‘[n]o reasonable consumer would believe’ that purchased content would remain on the iTunes platform indefinitely,” wrote Mendez in an &lt;a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/california/caedce/2:2020cv01628/377618/22/0.pdf?ts=1618990542"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; filed with the Eastern District of California. “But in common usage, the term ‘buy’ means to acquire possession over something. It seems plausible, at least at the motion to dismiss stage, that reasonable consumers would expect their access couldn’t be revoked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="XIvBgO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To quote Webster’s definition of “buy”...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O69b21"&gt;To emphasize his point, Mendez pointed to the definition of the word “buy” in the &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buy"&gt;Mirriam-Webster dictionary&lt;/a&gt; (meaning “to acquire possession, ownership, or rights to the use or services of by payment especially of money”) — a timeless move that is, apparently, as welcome in federal legal proceedings as in hastily-written wedding speeches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27Kz4t"&gt;Apple tried to argue that Andino’s “injury” was purely speculative, as he has not actually lost access to any content. But, as Mendez summarizes, the injury being presented is not the threat of losing future access, but the deception involved in Apple’s use of the word “buy.” This misleads consumers about the exact nature of ownership, meaning Andino “paid either too much for the product or spent money he would not have but for the misrepresentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwygkI"&gt;Apple did have some success, though, and one element of the lawsuit was dismissed: Andino’s claims to “unjust enrichment,” which would affect how any potential damages would be calculated. Mendez did, though, leave open the possibility of future “injunctive relief” — that is, material changes to how Apple sells content in future. All these questions, though, will have to be settled in future proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Siri Remote waves goodbye to Apple TV games that require motion control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVlOdKQnByZasU0uBk2tT9_NSXs=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69173835/WcGeQVXeT3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SFX6wg"&gt;Apple’s new Siri Remote doesn’t come equipped with an accelerometer or gyroscope, which means it won’t work as a motion controller in certain Apple TV games. The omission was initially &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/new-siri-remote-59-dollars/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and can be seen on the remotes’ product pages. The &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ir5H-fryxNwJ:https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MQGD2ZM/A/siri-remote+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; Siri Remote lists an “Accelerometer” and “Three-axis gyro” in the tech specs, but they’re missing from the &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:n66JH8vbfHYJ:https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJFM3LL/A/siri-remote+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;new listing&lt;/a&gt; (we’ve linked to a Google Cache because as of this writing Apple’s store is down ahead of AirTags pre-orders going live).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7asiI"&gt;The change means that the new Siri Remote won’t work with certain Apple TV games that rely on motion controls. According to code in tvOS 14.5 &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/22/new-siri-remote-lacks-accelerometer-gyroscope/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, trying to play an incompatible game will lead to the following error message: “To play this game on your Apple TV, you need to connect the Apple TV Remote (1st generation) or a compatible PlayStation, Xbox or MFi controller.” If you’ve got one, you might want to keep an old Siri Remote around for occasions like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQhZTH"&gt;The lack of motion controls might sound surprising given the new Apple TV box was expected to have a bigger gaming focus, and arrives as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple Arcade is maturing&lt;/a&gt; into a pretty compelling games subscription service. But in recent years Apple has shifted its attention towards more traditional gaming controllers, away from motion controls. It dropped its requirement for games to support the Siri Remote’s motion controls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/14/11930760/apple-tv-games-controller-remote-requirement"&gt;in June 2016&lt;/a&gt; just months after the remote launched alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9630952/new-apple-tv-4-review"&gt;2015 Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in June 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650683/apple-tv-xbox-one-ps4-controller-support-wwdc-2019"&gt;it announced&lt;/a&gt; Apple TV support for Xbox One and PS4 controllers. Support for PS5 and Xbox Series X and S controllers is &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1612241720"&gt;expected to arrive with tvOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTdow6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends reprieve, won’t take a cut of online classes and events until next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9YV-Fg0lbSGN7QOfXK9oShZhfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69173462/acastro_190322_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vl0knn"&gt;Apple announced on Wednesday that it’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6qfoid1d&amp;amp;1619114022"&gt;once again extending the deadline&lt;/a&gt; for requiring in-app purchases for iOS apps that sell access to online classes and group events until December 31st, 2021, effectively meaning it won’t impose its 30 percent cut on businesses providing those services until next year. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21595040/apple-developer-in-app-purchase-deadline-online-classes-events"&gt;extended the deadline initially to June 30th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but now developers have another six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TeBrI"&gt;Apple cites the ongoing pandemic as its main justification for the change, but we have to wonder if it might also have something to do with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;the Congressional antitrust hearings that have zeroed in on whether Apple and Google’s app stores are monopolies&lt;/a&gt;. Helping out small businesses by not taking its traditional 30 percent cut is an example Apple can now use to demonstrate how it encourages small businesses to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGWxmt"&gt;Wednesday’s &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/antitrust-applied-examining-competition-in-app-stores"&gt;“Antitrust Applied: Examining Competition in App Stores”&lt;/a&gt; hearing featured complaints from lost item tracker company Tile, who Apple is now in direct competition with thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s new AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and Match Group, whose Tinder dating app uses Apple’s in-app purchases for subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oDlVz"&gt;Not every company pays 30 percent. Apple doesn’t apply the same in-app purchases requirement to one-on-one classes like tutoring, so individuals can take other forms of payments and bypass Apple’s cut entirely. Apple’s also been criticized for quietly creating special deals for big companies like Amazon, where subscriptions sold on its Prime Video app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;are only subject to a 15 percent fee&lt;/a&gt;. (Generally, Apple doesn’t reduce its cut of subscription fees to 15 percent until users have been subscribed for a full year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGfuN5"&gt;After Amazon’s seeming sweetheart deal came to light, Apple launched a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021 where developers who earn less than $1 million in sales every year can apply to lower Apple’s commission to 15 percent on purchases — but only with Apple’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVIcV8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;Apple is now launching podcast subscriptions too&lt;/a&gt;, ones where podcasters can join by paying $19.99 a year plus 30 percent of each subscriber’s first year of revenue, then 15 percent after for subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Can Apple get you to pay for podcasts?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yI6dGrsZAUdMc5nzX-oEDn2h16o=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170854/VRG_ILLO_4546_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The world’s most popular podcast app gets subscriptions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CyXaHi"&gt;Beth Silvers credits paid subscriptions for making podcasting her full-time job. She and Sarah Stewart Holland host &lt;a href="https://www.pantsuitpoliticsshow.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show that tries to turn political punditry into “grace-filled conversations.” The two of them launched the show in 2015 and then started experimenting with subscriptions two years later, first on their own website in the form of monthly contributions, and then, not long after, on Patreon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpYz2O"&gt;Three years later, they now have over 4,000 monthly subscribers who pay anywhere from $5 to $100 per month, employ a full-time listener-turned-employee, and fully focus their time on the show. Their revenue is now equally made up of advertising and memberships. “It was still a big risk [when we switched to Patreon],” Silvers says. “We weren’t quite at a sustainable point. We thought to get to sustainability, we’ve got to invest more time here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JWBcU"&gt;Now, the women are trying something new: Apple Podcasts subscriptions. They’re among the first creators who’ve signed up to try the service, which allows podcasters to offer paid subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;from within the Podcasts app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNCclH"&gt;The most popular podcasting app putting its weight behind subscriptions could be monumental. Apple has the chance to popularize paid subscriptions by making it easy to listen and subscribe in one place, and it could influence the industry to shift slightly away from its dependence on advertising at the same time. Plus, unlike other solutions, Apple will also allow listeners to try these subscriptions for free for a limited amount of time, giving people a chance to preview what they’re paying to access. Apple’s not precious about the content podcasters offer there, either. Shows and bonus content don’t have to be exclusive to the platform, and they can mix free and paid content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRuoiNM2PxuTr4bDIIlEr1U9X7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462736/download.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Podcasts’ subscription product will let creators decide how much to charge for content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iEEODu"&gt;“When Apple does [subscriptions], it’s like flicking a switch,” says Jacob Weisberg, CEO of podcasting network Pushkin Industries, which author Malcolm Gladwell co-founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47ZJC9"&gt;Even David Stern, the CEO of Supporting Cast, which runs a competing podcast subscription platform, sees Apple’s entrance as a turning point for the industry. “The number one challenge we have in getting podcasters to consider working with Supporting Cast is simply that people aren’t used to the idea of a paid podcast,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.supportingcast.fm/post/what-apple-podcast-subscriptions-means-for-supporting-cast-slate-and-our-podcasters-2"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. “Apple’s push into premium content will help the industry understand how much revenue they are leaving on the table by not giving their listeners something to pay for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0kGta"&gt;The potential upside for podcasters is huge. Apple Podcasts is the biggest podcast listening platform in the world, and listeners won’t have to leave the app to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6d4Qq"&gt;But the service does come with trade-offs. Most crucially, podcasters have to pay a flat fee of $19.99 per year to even offer subscriptions, and they then give Apple a 30 percent cut of revenue for each subscriber’s first year and 15 percent for the years following. Patreon, in contrast, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing"&gt;takes up to&lt;/a&gt; 12 percent of creators’ revenue. Apple Podcasts is also only available on iOS devices, which most of the world doesn’t use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tArcOr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple could make paying for podcasts mainstream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5rI0H"&gt;Those may be tough terms for podcasters, but it might pay off. Apple Podcasts’ marketing potential is massive, and it should make it far easier for hosts to promote a subscription. Right now, podcasters who offer exclusive or bonus content often do so through private RSS feeds, which require listeners to input a link into the listening app of their choice — a feature that some apps, like Spotify, don’t support. Podcasters might have to walk them through this process, and if someone cancels their membership, it generally falls on the podcaster to make sure their RSS link access is revoked. Getting listeners to pay also usually involves convincing them to sign up for another platform, like Patreon, a far bigger hurdle than tapping a button inside the app they’re already using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cu2p8h"&gt;This is why the &lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt; team signed up for Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions, especially considering a majority of their listeners are on Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcQd85"&gt;“We like giving our listeners options, and we feel like there are people who probably would like our bonus content who just don’t want to deal with the hassle of figuring Patreon out,” Silvers says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNr0N0"&gt;But they’re going to have to get creative with how they advertise their perks. Patreon is more fully built out to support creators who want various benefits. In &lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt;’ case, subscribers not only receive bonus content, but also a community on Patreon itself where they can chat about episodes and participate in a book club where Silvers and Stewart Holland ship the books they plan to discuss. Silvers and Stewart Holland also receive their listeners’ personal information, like addresses, which help them decide where to tour. Their listeners’ emails, which they also receive, allow them to send FYIs about ticket sales or other content, like YouTube Lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nJQ1hW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hurdle of signing up for an extra service might be too much for some listeners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3uuGmR"&gt;“We all just love convenience, like we love our stuff to just be in one place,” says Jessica Cordova Kramer, the CEO of Lemonada Media, which plans to use Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions in addition to existing subscription services. “And yes, there’s an extra hoop to jump through if you’re using something that’s outside the listening ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH5GaL"&gt;Apple doesn’t yet seem interested in building the social aspect of podcasting communities, so if podcasters want to advertise their Discord or Patreon, they’ll have to shout out those perks and ask listeners to contact them for access — another hurdle. Apple also won’t give podcasters their listeners’ emails, names, phone numbers, addresses, or any personal information, so Apple ends up mediating all interactions and keeping the data. Apple does say it’ll give podcasters aggregated, anonymized analytics about their listeners, like where they’re based, but these tools likely won’t wholly replace the benefits of having subscribers’ emails or names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elvcpq"&gt;“Having the Discord in our community has been so rewarding to us, the hosts, and the people that have joined it. Without being able to foster that ... is almost like a blocker for the Apple subscriptions,” says Matt Kolowski, a host of a show about movies called &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/70mm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;70mm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has around 140 subscribers on Patreon. “I’d really love for them to realize that a sense of community is such a huge part of creating a fun podcast experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubPsqH"&gt;In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about Apple’s push into subscriptions, Patreon’s chief revenue officer Kerri Pollard specifically called out its community features as a selling point. “We know creators see the value in our offering that serves them and their communities first, and will continue to use Patreon,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDf8jm"&gt;Community has become so important, in fact, that even Facebook justified &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;its push&lt;/a&gt; into audio and podcasting this week because of it. The company says 170 million people on Facebook are connected to a page that’s linked to a specific podcast, and more than 35 million people are members of fan groups around podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="41LJxw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some podcasters say, more than anything else, their subscribers value community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nFoA8h"&gt;Another factor for podcasters to consider: more platforms means more administrative work. RSS promised one feed for all the apps, but the ecosystem of subscriptions isn’t shaping up that way. Kolowski and his co-hosts upload bonus and early access content to Patreon; their usual shows to their hosting provider, Anchor; and if they participate in Apple Podcasts, they’d need to separately post uploads there, too. If Spotify gets into the subscription game, they might have to manually upload content there as well — although being on Anchor, a Spotify company, might pay off in that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYsMQg"&gt;“Ultimately, I don’t really want like four places to upload a podcast to because selfishly, I don’t want to have that kind of legwork,” Kolowski says, adding that most of his show’s listeners are on Pocket Casts, not Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Xli1"&gt;But for larger networks, Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions might be the right fit at the right time. Pushkin Industries &lt;a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/news/announcing-pushnik-premium-subscription-program/"&gt;is launching&lt;/a&gt; its first subscription program, PushNik, through Apple Podcasts, with plans to eventually make the bonus and exclusive content available on other apps. Pushkin CEO Weisberg helped &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launch Slate Plus, a subscription program that includes ad-free podcasts, years ago, and says, at the time, there were no easy solutions for publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCgfDG"&gt;“It was so clunky to get the private RSS feed into whatever player you use,” he says. “It’s just a lot of steps, and to me it was really difficult, and the thing that I was always banging on about at Slate was we’ve got to reduce the number of clicks to get the bonus content for subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUlcSH"&gt;Apple’s subscriptions solve that. Of course, in the years since &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launched Slate Plus, Patreon has sprung up, as have other companies like Supporting Cast, which &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launched to help other podcasters set up memberships. They don’t solve the one-click problem, but they at least provide the infrastructure and tech support to keep a subscription business running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GkvBfu"&gt;For these networks, a 30 percent initial cut that eventually goes to 15 percent might be worth it. Extra money is extra money. But for the smaller podcasters who’ve focused on community and creating a fan base of engaged listeners, Apple might not provide enough — especially if a show reaches a global audience that’s more Android-based than iOS. But it seems almost certain that with Apple supporting and caring about subscriptions, more people than ever before will be paying for shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Put macOS on the iPad, you cowards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad Pro 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07sFWBZAfun631ZXLpVBIFBiyC0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168801/ipadpro2021lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aawcti"&gt;Okay, hear me out on this. I really would just like Apple’s next iPad Pro to be a laptop. Not a clamshell, but a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt; type of deal: a tablet with laptop hardware and a laptop OS. I think there must be people at Apple who want this, too, so I’m now respectfully requesting that the company stop dilly-dallying and make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MybJ4v"&gt;Here’s my reasoning: at Tuesday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;Spring Loaded event&lt;/a&gt;, Apple finally unveiled a long-rumored update to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. While the device doesn’t look too different from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394384/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-comparison"&gt;iPad Pro models&lt;/a&gt; of years past, it’s a huge leap forward on the inside because it’s powered by Apple’s eight-core M1 processor. That’s the same processor that powers its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; (as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt;), and it’s exceptional. To repeat, the new iPad Pro isn’t using a Macbook-&lt;em&gt;adjacent &lt;/em&gt;or MacBook-&lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; processor. It’s using the same processor that’s in those laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHNb2N"&gt;Let’s review what else the iPad Pro can do. It now supports &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22396449%2Fapple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Thunderbolt 3&lt;/a&gt; and can power additional displays at up to 6K resolution. It supports 5G. It can come with up to 2TB of storage and 16GB of RAM. You can connect a keyboard and touchpad. On paper, that’s a laptop. (Or it’s a Surface Pro, whatever you want to call that.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bz82VRGHsKgD0S2272wfd2glUlg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460638/lcimg_80056320_9cae_41a0_ae7b_242b83419310.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GrOfJI"&gt;But that’s before you actually use the thing. Personally, I just can’t use iPadOS for my daily multitasking workload. On a MacBook, I can duck in and out of Zoom calls to mess around in Chrome and keep several tabs and applications open on my screen at once. Doing that on the iPad is, comparatively, a mess — I can reasonably look at one or two apps max, resizing is a pain, and it doesn’t take full advantage of my external display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13sRfW"&gt;Furthermore, iOS apps still have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;less functionality&lt;/a&gt; than their macOS counterparts across the board. A MacBook can just do more. And until the iPad Pro gains the ability to run macOS apps (or, dare I suggest, macOS), I don’t see that calculus changing. I’m far from a creative professional, but I still need my daily driver to be able to run the full version of Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsakfa"&gt;But now that the iPad Pro is an M1 system, I don’t see why it &lt;em&gt;can’t &lt;/em&gt;run macOS apps. Because it has the same hardware as the MacBook Air (including the fanless form factor). So the iPad really should be able to run whatever the MacBook Air can run. (And the MacBook Air can run just about whatever you want. Take a look at our review for a deep dive there.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JE2pd4"&gt;Battery is a potential pitfall: the larger iPad has a nearly 20 percent smaller battery than the Air (40.88Whr to the Air’s 49.9Whr). But both M1 MacBooks have excellent battery life, and the larger iPad’s battery is still similar in size to that of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;Lenovo’s ThinkPad X12 Detachable&lt;/a&gt; and bigger than that of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20948092/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; — neither of which have been a disaster in our testing. So I’d be surprised if it can’t get the job done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbJS4P"&gt;Apple has also shown that it’s not afraid to bring consumers into a messy software transition. After all, the new M1 MacBooks can run iPhone and iPad apps natively. Many of them, upon the machines’ release, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;weren’t available&lt;/a&gt; or didn’t work well. The sky did not fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24mltE"&gt;And of course, Apple has been working to make its ecosystem more cohesive for quite a while. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902020/macos-catalina-review-apple-music-podcasts-catalyst-ipad-apps"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; makes it more convenient for developers to port their apps between iPadOS and macOS. And many of the tweaks the company made to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur &lt;/a&gt;seem specifically designed to bring the operating system closer to the look and feel of iOS — from the rounded window corners and iOS-ified dock icons to the newly translucent layers — and some of its new features (like the new Control Center and the native iOS apps) are iPad staples that don’t make a ton of sense to have on a non-touch device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHLy3v"&gt;The result of all this is that we’re moving toward a weird point in the evolution of these two devices where the MacBook can do everything the iPad can do (but it doesn’t have the touchscreen hardware to take advantage of all of it), while the iPad can still only do iPad things (even though features of macOS would take good advantage of its touchscreen capability). It seems like a point where Apple’s goals of “creating a seamless ecosystem” and “selling you many different products” are starting to butt heads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHZuTZ"&gt;So putting macOS apps on the iPad seems like a natural next step in Apple’s process. And from a consumer perspective, I think it could only be a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Io6uKfyBXhbwHw3tr3eFhFsafeI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459118/Center_stage_ipad.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what video calls on the iPad are supposed to look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6Tjr86"&gt;In addition to the touch capability and stylus support, the new iPad Pro makes up for the MacBook’s greatest weakness: its grainy garbage webcam. The iPad Pro has been upgraded with a new 12MP TrueDepth ultrawide camera and a feature called Center Stage, which will follow you around and keep your face centered during video chats. This is a great feature for students and professionals who have to take a lot of conference calls from home (myself included) and don’t want to deal with an external device. That said: video calls are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;kind of a pain on iPadOS&lt;/a&gt; (in part because the camera is still on the side, in landscape mode), and, as I noted above, multitasking during them is a lot harder than it is on a MacBook. macOS and the iPad’s camera hardware seem like a good fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqmEPQ"&gt;There’s also the larger iPad’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Liquid Retina XDR display&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like it’s going to be a game-changer. Incorporating over 10,000 Mini LEDs, it’s said to reach 1,000 nits of brightness (which is brighter than many 4K HDR TVs on the market). And 1,000-nit Windows laptops exist (as do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056429/msis-creator-17-laptop-mini-led-1000-nits-hdr-4k"&gt;Mini LED laptops&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s uncommon to see them under the $2,000 price point. This isn’t hardware that the average office user needs — but in a laptop, it would be one of the best screens you can get at its price point, hands down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxIcAN"&gt;Now, would an iPad Pro running macOS be the right purchase for everyone? Of course not. Not everyone wants to work on a 12.9-inch screen all day. I’ll admit that I’d probably find it cramped. I also know people who use the 12.3-inch Surface Pro 7 as their primary driver with no complaints. Many folks care more about having a full-featured PC in a convertible and super versatile form factor than they do about having a big screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOaS1B"&gt;That’s why I’m convinced there would be an audience for a convertible iPad Pro — especially if its performance and battery life are finally up to par with that of a MacBook. (The iPad Pro also has one fewer USB port, but that’s easily resolved with a dongle. Come on, people.) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here is the purple iPhone 12, which is purple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iW_qOjdrAN-ln6gAgylVTAJ-pe0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168438/vpavic_4547_20210421_0022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A purple iPhone 12&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNuuh3"&gt;Apple managed to surprise us during its live stream event earlier this week by announcing a new iPhone. Well, a new &lt;em&gt;color&lt;/em&gt; for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini: purple. Apple sent one to us along with some sample AirTags and so we have duly taken some photos of this, a purple iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrgmXw"&gt;It’s a lightish shade of purple. One might be tempted to call it lavender, but to me it’s a bit more like a lilac or maybe a wisteria. It lacks the redness you’d expect in a mauve or the blue tones you’d see in a violet. There are many &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_(color)"&gt;shades of purple&lt;/a&gt;, but this one is what Apple went with and I like it. It’s unmistakable even at a distance, whereas the light green iPhone 12 models could be mistaken for off-white in certain light. I am also glad it doesn’t have a fancy name. It’s just “purple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnU4Uy"&gt;The purple iPhone 12 is in all other ways the same as the other colors of the iPhone 12: it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;very fast, has a very nice screen, 5G, and great cameras&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just a little more royal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XlwYOe"&gt;Alongside the purple iPhone, Apple also released its AirTags location trackers. Here’s a first look at those:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag and the Find My app" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuJjx3uLgXhd5Bp9vyxoGP1gtsg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168440/vpavic_4547_20210421_0097.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An AirTag and the Find My app&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;They work super well, and they’re one more thing keeping you on the iPhone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="f3bzgq"&gt;I was starting to get really worried that I wouldn’t find my friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeS892"&gt;For this first look at AirTags, I sent Vjeran Pavic off into an unfamiliar city with a single Apple AirTag and no phone, no smartwatch, or any other mode of communication. The challenge was to see if Apple’s Find My system for locating AirTags would be able to lead me to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKAkp8"&gt;Apple AirTags weren’t designed for an elaborate game of hide-and-seek. They can help you locate anything they’re attached to; most of the time you’ll be listening for their little chirps as you hunt down the keys you inexplicably left sitting on top of the fridge instead of on the hook where they belong. For that purpose they work incredibly well, right on down to a little arrow on the iPhone’s screen pointing in the direction and little haptic taps as encouragement that you’re getting warmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPyX0j"&gt;But this exercise was a very good stress test for the new $29 iPhone accessory ($99 for a four pack), because it meant that the only chance I had of tracking Vjeran down is if one of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-introduces-airtag%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22396693%2Fapple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;near-billion&lt;/a&gt; Find My-enabled devices on the planet happened to pick up the AirTag’s Bluetooth signal and send it back to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RLUSJr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It only took a couple of passing iPhones to accurately locate an AirTag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IbWZ9W"&gt;After a half-hour of walking around, I finally found him. He was standing on a street corner with no foot traffic whatsoever, which meant that the intermittent signals I got detailing his location came from a couple of iPhones in cars that were driving by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sG4SFn"&gt;That’s impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvexyC"&gt;AirTags have been rumored for years but never seemed to materialize. They’re really here now and though I wouldn’t go so far as to say they’re worth the wait, I do think Apple has put together a thoughtfully designed system that goes a long way toward ensuring privacy and safety while still making it easier for you to locate your stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtRueK"&gt;AirTags are a very Apple-y Apple product, and that ends up being great but also just a little annoying (and, for third-party companies like Tile, troubling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FhLnnx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here is the purple iPhone 12, which is purple ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22160543"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AirTags" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qPeprEY3uZnYIrPxafC5-14_lS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461387/vpavic_4547_20210421_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirTags&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ikPenn"&gt;The basics of AirTags are simple enough to understand: each one is a tiny little puck with a Bluetooth Low Energy radio and a U1 ultra-wideband (UWB) chip. You pair it with your iPhone just like you do with AirPods, holding it nearby and then tapping through a short setup process. After that, they’re available in a new “Items” tab in the Find My app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zhkyu"&gt;From the app, you can set the AirTags to chirp, mark them as lost (which enables some different features), or just tap the button that lets you locate them in space. If you have an iPhone with UWB, it can locate the AirTag in physical space and point a little arrow at it when you get within four feet or so. It all works very well and is very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple keychain accessory" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RV4V3dolejjqJ3ffVAvRQcROfzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461382/vpavic_4547_20210421_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AirTag in an Apple keychain accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6HtVcSHgAaaBhX6TuKfMTrj7XVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461386/vpavic_4547_20210421_0070.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TBtYbz"&gt;From a design perspective, an AirTag is &lt;em&gt;classic&lt;/em&gt; Apple. It’s a white and shiny silver little button, and you can have custom emoji or letters printed on the plastic. They are as cute as the buttons they resemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjMn8K"&gt;However, you’ll soon find the plastic is scuffed and the chrome on the back is scratched. Sincerely, do not expect these to stay looking pristine for long — not since the weird early days of the iPod nano has an Apple product gotten scuffed this easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HcPV4Y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here’s the scuffs and scratches on an AirTag after a few hours of handling. I don’t think we did anything excessive here either. I mean it’s not a huge deal that this happens but it’s still pretty weird! &lt;a href="https://t.co/kkD2A6OhCn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kkD2A6OhCn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1385223768981733376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="18Zubv"&gt;One clever touch is that the plastic body itself serves as the speaker. It’s what vibrates to make the chirping noise. It gets plenty loud, though my old ears had a bit of a difficult time using just that sound to locate one. Also, if for whatever reason the AirTag is squeezed or compressed, that will dampen how loud it can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBCOhY"&gt;There’s also no hole on them for a lanyard loop. If you want to actually attach one to anything instead of dropping it in a pocket, you’ll need to buy an accessory. That, increasingly, also feels like a classic Apple move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GesLat"&gt;The one &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-Apple part of the design is that the battery is actually user-replaceable. A little twist of the bottom reveals a standard CR2032 cell, which Apple claims should be good for a year of battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/se0Xj94XLrepGAWvfBgQdxaRhSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461436/IMG_2741.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n00obOEmwKOlY40OBccRkzNCyLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461435/IMG_2742.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EtKqBR"&gt;The real trick — and the hidden complexity — arises when you are tracking an AirTag out in the world, when something is truly lost. Like everything in Apple’s Find My network, the AirTag’s location is end-to-end encrypted so only you can see its location. But any iOS device can send that location to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlOWLw"&gt;If somebody comes upon a lost AirTag, they can tap it via NFC to see information about it, including its serial number (which could be important if you think it’s being used to track you). If the owner has put it in “Lost Mode,” they have the option to have that information page show their phone number and a brief message so you can contact them. This NFC feature works equally well with iPhones and Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPCQeu"&gt;That means all it takes to locate an AirTag is for any iPhone with Bluetooth on to see it — even if that iPhone is whizzing by in a car. Apple is leveraging its huge network of devices as a competitive advantage here — along with the competitive advantage of directly offering this functionality as a system-level feature. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/"&gt;Tile has asked Congress&lt;/a&gt; to look into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The pairing process for AirTags is just like pairing AirPods" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00YS7IOym90TTCaI-N9Z8H6Pk8o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461378/vpavic_4547_20210421_0032.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pairing process for AirTags is just like pairing AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6yT5cP"&gt;A Bluetooth device broadcasting anything is a potential privacy risk, so Apple is cycling each AirTag’s Bluetooth identifier “frequently.” More than that, though, Apple has also done some work to develop a system that also considers personal safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxuLSK"&gt;If the Find My network notices that an AirTag has been separated from its owner for a while and seems to be in the same place you are, it will alert you. If you’re an iPhone user, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;you’ll see a notification&lt;/a&gt; that says “AirTag Found Moving With You.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/my-JQ011JKmly4wAl-rJczGViMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461476/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A bunch of AirTags.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="Br9q28"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It tries to alert you if it thinks it’s being used to track you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fahKUR"&gt;Apple says that there are options to disable these “Safety Alerts” if you are “borrowing” something. But the real purpose is clear: to protect you from somebody using an AirTag to surreptitiously track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3GVuC"&gt;When you see the alert, you can tap the notification to get a screen that will allow you to make the AirTag start beeping. The alert will also instruct you on how to disable the AirTag by removing the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kUuSag"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aT8MXm"&gt;Finally, Apple says, “If you feel your safety is at risk, contact your local law enforcement who can work with Apple. You might need to provide the AirTag or its serial number.” Apple won’t be able to provide your location, but it could provide governments with information related to the person who registered the AirTag as theirs in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TzBRX"&gt;If you’re an Android user, well, virtually none of this is going to work for you. However, the AirTag does have at least one potential trick. If it’s been separated from its owner and then detects that it’s suddenly on the move, it will start beeping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsG7bO"&gt;All in all, I think it’s a thoughtfully designed system, but it’s also definitely one that leverages Apple’s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An AirTag" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tN1fzfEdBhCr_ZytOAxuh2IIq_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461379/vpavic_4547_20210421_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AirTag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r0aAf4"&gt;Really, the AirTag is the Most Apple Product I’ve seen in a while. It’s just a little more expensive than the competition. It’s beautifully designed, but its hardware still somehow fails to actually take the practical realities of our dirty, messy world into account. It’s very privacy-focused. It really only works with Apple devices. It offers features that no third-party device can really match thanks to Apple’s tight integration (or tight grip on its APIs, depending on your point of view). And since there’s no Android version of Find My, it’s another piece of the Apple ecosystem that’s going to keep you from switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQDaRB"&gt;An AirTag is a very Apple-y thing for Apple users who already live in Apple’s ecosystem. They work great — and will be great at keeping you in Apple’s world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 will reportedly include notifications revamp, new iPad home screen, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad Pro 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-XAW00ALCCBbPtkZjGEnfblsnk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168139/ipadpro2021lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple announced a new iPad Pro this week with a beefy M1 chip&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Can new software take advantage of this processibng power? &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w9veBM"&gt;Apple is getting ready to announce a raft of software updates for the iPhone and iPad in June according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including “the most significant update to the [iPad’s] Home Screen since first launching the product in 2010.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YWEG4"&gt;The new versions of iOS and iPadOS — iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 — will be unveiled at Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22320961/apple-wwdc-2021-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos"&gt;upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference&lt;/a&gt; (WWDC) on June 7th, says &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Last year’s iOS 14 update was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21291695/apple-ios-14-updates-home-screen-redesign-features-release-date-wwdc-2020"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC on June 22nd, before becoming available for download on September 16th in time to accompany the iPhone 12 release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bps6pf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s story has a host of details about what to expect from the latest versions of Apple’s mobile software, but here are the biggest points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Y3ud1p"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;New notification filters based on user status&lt;/strong&gt;. From a new menu accessible from the Lock Screen and Control Center, users will have more granular control over how notifications are displayed (do they play sounds or not, for example) based on whether they’re driving, sleeping, at work, or have turned on Do Not Disturb mode. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3f7V32"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;iPad home screen upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;. This will reportedly include the ability to add widgets (introduced in iOS last year). &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t offer any more details, but claims this will be the most significant update to the iPad home screen since the product launched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DFopT1"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Quick access to privacy data&lt;/strong&gt;. A new menu will reportedly let users see what information apps are collecting about them. Presumably this would tap the same data used by Apple for new “privacy labels” introduced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;the App Store&lt;/a&gt; last December. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GLpMxQ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Updated iOS Lock Screen&lt;/strong&gt;. This will include access to the above privacy menu. It’s not clear if any other changes are coming. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tuL8w5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Social upgrades for iMessage&lt;/strong&gt;. New features would help iMessage compete with WhatsApp “with the eventual goal of acting as more of a social network.” But &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;says these are “still early in development” and might be announced later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="e8w1Mt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Minor updates for macOS, watchOS, and tvOS&lt;/strong&gt;. Apple launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295489/apple-macos-big-sur-update-redesign-apps-features-catalyst-wwdc-2020"&gt;big redesign for macOS&lt;/a&gt; last year with Big Sur, so it seems right to expect only small changes this time round. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="sfJAc4"&gt;These are the first reliable rumors we’ve heard about what to expect from iOS and iPadOS 15, though they aren’t particularly surprising. Updated notification filters and access to app data are solid additions but not splashy features. Meanwhile, giving iPadOS the same widgets available in iOS is welcome but hardly a major change. Given that the iPad Pro got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;upgraded with a beefy M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; this week, we’re still hoping that Apple will be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;bit more ambitious&lt;/a&gt; about what its tablets can deliver in future in terms of software. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t suggest a leap forward but we’ll have to wait for WWDC to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJAeBS"&gt;Meanwhile, iOS 14.5 is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394200/apple-ios-14-5-watch-os-7-4-mac-os-11-3-release-date"&gt;arrive next week&lt;/a&gt; featuring support for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;new AirTag&lt;/a&gt; item trackers, and the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;new podcast features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, older Apple TVs can also be calibrated with your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qR88KYp2MIxI8ccvGKLTsRIJb84=/0x0:964x643/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168121/msedge_E88SepwLyF.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H2LdR5"&gt;Apple’s new TV calibration feature, which uses the iPhone’s front-facing sensors to sense and tweak the output of the Apple TV, works with the company’s older streaming boxes, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/21/new-tvos-14-5-color-balancing-feature-works-with-older-apple-tv-models-heres-how-to-use-it/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature will arrive with tvOS 14.5, which is due to release “early next week” for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;2017 Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; and 2015 Apple TV HD. Apple says viewers will see “much more accurate colors and improved contrast” after calibration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ibt1KG"&gt;The calibration feature was announced alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"&gt;new Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;. It works by having you hold up the front of your iPhone to your TV, so it can sense how the screen is outputting different colors. If the phone’s light sensor sees that color is being outputted inaccurately, the Apple TV can adjust its output to compensate. The process only covers the Apple TV’s content, and won’t affect the TV’s built in apps or other devices it has plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tMNJxe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple promises “much more accurate colors and improved contrast” from the feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgUool"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;, Apple TV HD and 4K owners can access the calibration feature via the Video and Audio section in the Settings app. As well as requiring an Apple TV updated to tvOS 14.5, the feature also requires Face ID-equipped iPhone running iOS 14.5. Both &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1618987304"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FlatPanelsHD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/neat-new-iphone-trick-optimize-your-apple-tv-picture-settings-with-your-phone-heres-how/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;note that the feature doesn’t work on TVs with Dolby Vision enabled after testing it with older Apple TVs running the latest tvOS 14.5 beta build, though it’s not immediately clear why this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpSCJK"&gt;Between this and the news that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394196/apple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons"&gt;Apple’s redesigned Siri Remote will also work with older Apple TVs&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is making it pretty easy for existing Apple TV owners to hold off on upgrading. &lt;/p&gt;
