    <title>Space billionaires get skewered in the first promo for Jon Stewart’s Apple TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPL-gUZEuLW95reYAtW0on8g7Ks=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608088/Screen_Shot_2021_07_20_at_12.04.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jon Stewart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7uUsHO"&gt;Jon Stewart shared a video promoting his upcoming Apple TV Plus show, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s an odd one: the three-minute and ten-second clip shared on Twitter is a comedy skit roasting the recent billionaire &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585470/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-amazon-customers"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, starring Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos and a mop as Richard Branson. There are also a lot of dick jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zL6eff"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1417557259886940162"&gt;Here’s the clip, if you’re curious&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CTAh9R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry for the aborted launch!!! I’m a bad twitterer. &lt;br&gt;Enjoy this small step for man! &lt;a href="https://t.co/6gBHHJLByQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6gBHHJLByQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Stewart (@jonstewart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1417557259886940162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1LxoS"&gt;It’s unclear exactly how this might relate to the show itself, which is set to debut in September. Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371914/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; that the show would be “a multiple season, one-hour, single-issue series” and each season will have a “companion podcast” released alongside it — it didn’t mention anything about comedy sketches lampooning space billionaires. It’s also still unclear how many episodes will be included in a season or how many seasons the show will have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHi2xI"&gt;I have to say that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chelseadevantez/status/1417565284773281793"&gt;this is pretty hilarious, though&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qYIUAr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We filmed the hat weeks ago   &lt;a href="https://t.co/OsJ8iIkTdY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OsJ8iIkTdY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chelsea Devantez (@chelseadevantez) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chelseadevantez/status/1417565284773281793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WbCaMn"&gt;Apple first revealed that the show was in the works &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. Stewart’s iconic show &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart &lt;/em&gt;ended in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade is getting a musical take on Tetris</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQsuZMGq-HfPbwuAWDVHsnIkPw4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606781/TetrisBeat_Screenshots_4.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QHmLqz"&gt;Apple Arcade’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;recent expansion&lt;/a&gt; means that the subscription service is now home to plenty of classic games — and things don’t get much more classic than T&lt;em&gt;etris&lt;/em&gt;. Today, Apple announced that &lt;em&gt;Tetris Beat&lt;/em&gt;, which mashes up the classic block-dropping puzzler with a rhythm game featuring music from the likes of Alison Wonderland, is coming to Arcade “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh3SRo"&gt;There’s no word on a specific release date, but &lt;em&gt;Beat&lt;/em&gt; features 18 exclusive songs, split-screen support if you’re on an Apple TV, and spatial audio for those listening with AirPods. It looks to be yet another inventive take on the game, following the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224853/tetris-99-battle-royale-nintendo-switch-review"&gt;the battle royale &lt;em&gt;Tetris 99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047826/tetris-effect-tetsuya-mizuguchi-interview-ps4-vr"&gt;Tetsuya Mizuguchi’s meditative &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8tEAy"&gt;The news is also part of a solid run for Apple Arcade. Last week saw the debut of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22568867/altos-odyssey-the-lost-city-apple-arcade-trailer-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while this Friday will include a huge Tokyo expansion for &lt;em&gt;Skate City&lt;/em&gt;, along with mobile classics &lt;em&gt;Jetpack Joyride&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/1/10699976/neko-atsume-the-game-of-passivity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neko Atsume&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Also listed as coming soon is the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;-like &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Stories&lt;/em&gt; (which coincidentally &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22568610/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-ruin-killing-monsties-guilty-conscience"&gt;just received a sequel&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tVVOEL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1j24hvPAMD4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Adobe releases Apple M1 support for Premiere Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Apple MacBook Air (late 2020)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t-AcKsQi58MKQe6yzyul3K1cuCM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605443/vpavic_4291_20201113_0385.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0WNEnL"&gt;Adobe’s Premiere Pro is now ready for everyone using an M1 Mac. Support for Apple’s new chips is rolling out today, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22192979/adobe-arm-m1-mac-apple-silicon-premiere-pro-beta"&gt;launching in beta&lt;/a&gt; in December. Adobe says there are speed increases throughout the app, from a 50 percent faster launch to 77 percent faster “editing,” whatever that giant term encompasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbQa8X"&gt;Apple released its first computers with M1 chips in November. Though they’re able to run apps that were built for machines with Intel processors, programs had to be updated to take full advantage of the M1’s speed improvements. Getting Adobe on board was always going to be a necessity — its apps are critical creative tools for many industries — and fortunately, Adobe has been fairly quick to get updates out the door for its biggest apps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162930/adobe-lightroom-arm64-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Lightroom for M1&lt;/a&gt; launched in December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323016/adobe-photoshop-apple-silicon-m1-now-available"&gt;Photoshop for M1&lt;/a&gt; launched in March, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523944/lightroom-classic-indesign-illustrator-m1-mac-native-version"&gt;Lightroom Classic, Illustrator, and InDesign for M1&lt;/a&gt; launched in June. Adobe Character Animator and Media Encoder are getting M1 support today, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9k0VS"&gt;Premiere Pro is also getting some other feature updates in its July release. The biggest is a speech to text feature, previously in beta, that’s able to automatically generate a video transcript. There’s also a new captions customization feature that lets you adjust how that text might display on your video.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pushes back return to offices due to rising COVID cases: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Aerial Views Of Silicon Valley Housing And Tech Campuses" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3z7EP1rVRfy_lkvq4hpAfgGIR10=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69604565/1178079031.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3fqDyv"&gt;Apple is delaying its plan to return to mandatory in-person work because of the increase of COVID cases driven by the Delta variant, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/apple-will-postpone-return-to-office-after-covid-19-persists"&gt;according to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. The company had laid out a roadmap for returning to its offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;in early September&lt;/a&gt;, with employees expected to come in at least three days a week, but now that deadline has reportedly been extended “by at least a month to October at the earliest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ilw7M8"&gt;Apple’s return to offices was controversial among some of its employees. A group of workers in an internal Slack channel for thousands of “remote work advocates” collaborated on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to CEO Tim Cook and the rest of Apple’s leadership, making the case that the company should embrace a more flexible work-from-home policy. Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s SVP of retail and people, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; to the request by saying “in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D6200r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mark Zuckerberg on taking his massive workforce remote","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21265780/facebook-remote-work-mark-zuckerberg-interview-wfh"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai on managing Google through the pandemic","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262934/google-alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-interview-pandemic-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bcQdRv"&gt;Apple was notoriously unfriendly to the concept of remote work pre-pandemic, and while allowing employees to work from home two days a week is a big change for the company, other Silicon Valley giants are giving workers more choice in where they do their jobs. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; that he sees around half of the company permanently shifting to remote work within the next five to ten years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;Google has said&lt;/a&gt; that it expects 20 percent of employees to stick with remote work once its offices are open again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yawzey"&gt;Now it appears that Apple is one of the first companies to alter its plans in response to surging COVID cases. Employees will be given at least a month’s warning before they’ll be expected to return to in-person work, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 14.7 just as MagSafe Battery Pack appears on shelves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RDTHQVonO8JzipfkTdz-2126zMQ=/0x22:2000x1355/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602462/MJWY3_AV4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U2Ct9Z"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211808#147"&gt;has released iOS 14.7&lt;/a&gt;, an update which lets iPhone 12 owners fully utilize the MagSafe Battery Pack, HomePod users manage timers from their phone, and more (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/19/ios-14-7-release-notes-features-changes/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgikvO"&gt;Arguably the update’s most exciting feature is one that adds support for new hardware: Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22576245/iphone-12-reverse-wireless-charging-magsafe-battery-pack"&gt;recently announced MagSafe battery pack&lt;/a&gt;, which should soon be arriving at stores and doorsteps. At least one of the charging devices has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22347900"&gt;already made its way to a customer’s hands&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple seems to be releasing the update in the nick of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePsyjW"&gt;The update also brings improvements to the HomePod timer experience, letting you manage timers from the Home app, rather than having to solely rely on your voice. Apple has also added a new Apple Card feature, which &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-introduces-apple-card-family-enabling-people-to-share-apple-card-and-build-credit-together%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F19%2F22583871%2Fapple-ios-14-7-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-ipad-timers-apple-card" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it announced in April&lt;/a&gt;: two Apple Card Family users can now merge their accounts to combine their credit limits, while keeping the lowest interest rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3rNsht"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can now manage HomePod timers from the Home app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CgSfFc"&gt;Some of the features included in 14.7 don’t seem to be available to those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;running the iOS 15 beta&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn’t yet seem like there are enough MagSafe Battery Packs out in the wild to get a clear picture of how well they work with iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifzJcX"&gt;Apple has also released WatchOS 7.6, which brings the ECG app and irregular heart rhythm notifications to 30 more places, as well as tvOS 14.7. Currently, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;Apple’s security updates page&lt;/a&gt; says that the latest version of iPadOS is still 14.6, so iPad users may have to wait a bit longer for the update to roll out to their devices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tbh0ec"&gt;Apple’s first official MagSafe Battery Pack is beginning to arrive on shelves (alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583871/apple-ios-14-7-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-ipad-timers-apple-card"&gt;a new IOS release&lt;/a&gt;), and one iPhone owner has now snapped what appear to be the first actual photos of the gadget. And yes, it’s a chonk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cAaJDO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18206642/apple-smart-battery-case-iphone-xs-xr-max-reveiw-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Apple’s been going the big-bulge route for years&lt;/a&gt;, possibly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872238/is-apples-smart-battery-case-mophie-patents"&gt;for legal reasons&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much of a surprise — but boy was Apple strategic about which angles it revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575678/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-12-pro-mini-max"&gt;when it first announced&lt;/a&gt; this new accessory! Compare to Apple’s original render:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mf1eOE8bo6R4Ze6QeWWs-pzf4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726603/MJWY3_AV4__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c01SM7"&gt;Now, here’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenrussell"&gt;Steven Russell&lt;/a&gt;, the owner of the new pack, with a slightly different angle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIRTtM0JoW3A389s2LLWTeamhfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726604/E6ntea7WQAAVxgu__1_.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A9Cbzx"&gt;Thickness isn’t necessarily a bad thing: wireless charging is notoriously inefficient, so Apple &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/14/apples-magsafe-battery-pack-has-more-capacity-than-it-seems---heres-why"&gt;needed to put a decent-size battery inside&lt;/a&gt; to make it worth your while, and it’s probably still thinner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297307/anker-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack-apple-iphone"&gt;than Anker’s option&lt;/a&gt; (which admittedly costs less than half the price). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqEpvF"&gt;Unlike Apple’s previously Smart Battery Cases, you may be getting more than just extended life for your phone — the snap-on, snap-off MagSafe pack appears to double as a Qi wireless charger for other devices. Russell says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenrussell/status/1417161249238945800"&gt;it seems to be charging his AirPods Pro wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt;, and you could theoretically even use it for an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XCRdtD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;One more thing to add. I have been asked if it wirelessly charges AirPods. Answer appears to be yes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2WCcKSOlbI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2WCcKSOlbI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steven Russell (@stevenrussell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenrussell/status/1417161249238945800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pLkGzs"&gt;I’m buying one for my iPhone 12 mini. Here’s looking forward to seeing how Apple’s image (below) translates into the real world. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warby Parker can renew glasses and contact lens prescriptions with its updated app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RqFCqZpvxisTNYZtREXMPphrj4Q=/168x0:1419x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600721/Screen_Shot_2021_07_16_at_10.44.40_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warby Parker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="86i0B9"&gt;Warby Parker is updating its Prescription Check iOS app on Monday with a new name and the ability to renew glasses &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; contact lens prescriptions on the iPhone 6S and up (the company currently doesn’t offer an Android app). Like its predecessor, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.warbyparker.com%2Fvirtual-vision-test&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F19%2F22580166%2Fwarby-parker-contact-lens-glasses-prescription-renewal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the new Warby Parker Virtual Vision Test&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a substitute for an actual optometrist visit, but being able to snag a new prescription for $15 without having to schedule an appointment should be very handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNCCxj"&gt;With Virtual Vision Test downloaded, you’ll be taken through some intake questions, not unlike what you might fill out in a normal optometrist visit (“Do you regularly get headaches?” etc.). Warby Parker requires you to meet some basic criteria as well, like being 18 years of age or older, not having any “eye health concerns,” using a single-vision distance prescription, and seeing well with your current glasses or contacts. With those taken care of, the app guides you through a simple vision test, reading off letters that appear on your phone’s screen, and alternating covering your eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLH3yy"&gt;Warby Parker says it takes about 48 hours for a new prescription to be written, but it won’t charge you $15 unless you’re approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nOyCPd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZC_xVikK5Zw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JyJeui"&gt;Prescription Check used a laptop and a phone to measure out your eyes’ distance from the test and to enter in prompts, but Virtual Vision Test makes things a bit easier. Warby Parker says the updated app uses a new “proprietary distance estimation algorithm” and a software framework exclusive to Apple devices called &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision"&gt;Vision Framework&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep everything contained on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQP5xU"&gt;Vision Framework covers a wide swath of possible use cases in iOS, from scanning bar codes to enabling the head tracking used in AR filters, but Warby Parker says that combined with its algorithm it makes the process of taking a vision test less complicated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1Ei92t"&gt;Because the tool is able to measure distance and tell a user when they’re at the correct distance to take the vision test, the possibility of human error while measuring is reduced. Overall, this results in an even simpler and more efficient user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="spx6Z6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A proprietary distance estimation algorithm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I8n54E"&gt;That’s helpful because this is the first time the company’s also offering the ability to renew a contact lens prescription online. Warby Parker’s Scout line of contact lenses &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-19/warby-parker-launches-scout-daily-contact-lenses-at-440-a-year"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but never made it to the older Prescription Check app until now. Warby Parker hasn’t said if any of the technical changes it’s made to its app make it easier to account for a contact prescription, but they do require different measurements and considerations than traditional glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qr1YuG"&gt;Ultimately, all of this high-tech convenience is to push you to buy new glasses frames or contacts directly from Warby Parker, and the company’s leveraged Apple tech to make that as fun and interactive as possible. If you have a iPhone X or newer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18205654/warby-parker-ar-iphone-face-id-mapping-glasses-try-on-app"&gt;you can virtually try on the company’s frames&lt;/a&gt; right from the Warby Parker app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4UymL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmqgrJ"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest leaks indicate new iPhones may have always-on displays like Apple’s Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mf_L1zV7IAzv_m4dcuHJ_uI_jM0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69598039/jbareham_170916_2000_0057.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R1XMX5"&gt;A new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman says the 2021 iPhone may have an always-on display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20869098/apple-watch-series-5-always-on-screen-features-price-best-smartwatch"&gt;similar to Apple’s Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and which Android phones have had for some time. Gurman wrote in his &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on"&gt;Power On newsletter&lt;/a&gt; that the phones will have improved battery life, a smaller notch on the screen, better video recording, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a faster A15 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7WmVs"&gt;It isn’t the first time a leak has suggested Apple is working on always-on screens for upcoming iPhones. Leaker Max Weinbach hinted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqOujNnuHBg&amp;amp;ab_channel=EverythingAppleProEAP"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that Apple may use the same kind of low temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels that its Watches have on future iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYvGYi"&gt;That’s in keeping with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s previous reporting that “at least one” of the four new iPhones will include an LTPO display. The technology dynamically adjusts Watches’ screen refresh rates to conserve battery life. Analyst &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt; also said earlier this year that the Pro iPhones coming this year would have LTPO displays and 120Hz refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIFGFl"&gt;In addition to the possibility of always-on iPhone screens, Gurman reported that Apple will likely announce new MacBook Pros this fall, “between September and November at the latest.” The computers will begin production in the third quarter, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Focus modes for notifications on iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LpwHJOG0qh5NeRuIONYyBV-oDcs=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69597234/focus2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lilxvH"&gt;One of the most powerful new features in iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, is Focus mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYYfJM"&gt;At its core, a Focus mode is a more customizable version of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb and is accessed from the same menu on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. But Focus modes are far more customizable, allowing for more granular triggers for when you’re filtering out notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Pn8SJy"&gt;To set up a Focus, head over to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Focus” and hit the plus button to add a new Focus. You’ll also be able to see existing Focus modes that you’ve set up and edit them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="byicVU"&gt;Apple offers a variety of preset Focus modes to start with, including Personal, Work, Fitness, Gaming, Reading, and more.  You’re not limited to Apple’s preset suggestions, though some of the presets — like the Driving, Fitness, or Gaming ones — offer additional features and triggers that aren’t available to user-created ones. Apple’s Fitness Focus mode, for example, can be automatically triggered when you start a Fitness Plus workout on your Apple Watch, while the Gaming mode can turn on whenever you connect a Bluetooth controller. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XSdC6b"&gt;You can create a custom Focus by selecting Custom, which will let you select a name, icon, and color for that specific focus. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0rJ922zkJK1HYgkTYRVlTUEmOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722624/IMG_2971.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting allowed contacts on a Focus mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BWlkT3UZMVR9mthWICQ3aFHl_fU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722625/IMG_2972.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selecting which apps can send notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RbG2hC"&gt;Next, you’ll be asked to choose which of your contacts (if any) you’d like to be able to message you when that Focus mode is activated — similar to how Do Not Disturb works. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ObuqH7"&gt;The following screen will ask you to select which apps (if any) you want to allow to send notifications when that Focus is active. For example, if you’re making a “Work” Focus, you might only want your email and Slack apps to be able to send you pings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zRv3Ws"&gt;Lastly, Apple will ask if you’d like to be able to receive special “Time Sensitive Notifications” — a new category of extra-important notifications that apps will be able to send that might not be able to wait until later. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68bOT1HEw2UNEI4aqXAgv3iyaiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722626/IMG_2973.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The toggle to permit time-sensitive notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hclipC1UmvcD8JJV2ma-rf14H2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722627/IMG_2967.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main Focus setting menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V6MgwY"&gt;Once you’ve finished setting up your Focus, you’ll end up on the Focus mode’s setting menu, where there are a few additional things you’ll be able to configure. You can also get back here at any time by heading to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Focus,” then selecting the Focus mode you want to edit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="51dh4u"&gt;The Focus Status menu will let you decide whether contacts will see a notice if you’re in an active Focus mode and their messages are muted. (Although right now, the only app that supports the feature is Apple’s Messages.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nui0Ov"&gt;The Home Screen menu allows you to hide specific home screens on your iPad or iPhone when you’re in a Focus mode. Combined with iOS 15’s App Library and the new ability to create multiple copies of an app icon, you can use this feature to customize what your phone looks like in different situations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R131dW"&gt;The Lock Screen menu offers the option to show or hide silenced notifications on the lock screen or to dim the lock screen when the Focus mode is active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RtJkCFe6sjUa3VlDU2CZcQ0E1Bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722631/Apple_iPadPro_iPadOS15_springboard_focus_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus modes on iPadOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="83ZphP"&gt;Finally, there’s the actual activation of a Focus mode. Apple offers two ways to turn on a Focus mode: you can either manually select it from the moon icon in Control Center or schedule it automatically (settings for which can be found in the Focus menu).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akxno0"&gt;The simplest option is “Smart Activation,” which has your device automatically toggle a Focus on its own. But you can also add more granular manual controls, activating a Focus for specific times, when you’re at a specific location, or when you’re using specific apps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon just got Fakespot booted off Apple’s iOS App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQcC_ha6Fx5vGHwYUEVWTyuCXug=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69593254/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0005.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="erAuS3"&gt;Fakespot, known for its web browser extensions that try to weed out fake product reviews, suddenly no longer has an iPhone or iPad app — because Amazon sent Apple a takedown request, both Amazon and Fakespot confirm, and Apple decided to remove the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C03rj2"&gt;The giant retailer says it was concerned about how a new update to the Fakespot app was “wrapping” its website without permission, and how that could be theoretically exploited to steal Amazon customer data. Fakespot founder Saoud Khalifah told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple abruptly removed the app today without any explanation. Apple confirms it removed the app, but disputes the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUUrCW"&gt;The new Fakespot app launched &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/03/2241643/0/en/Fakespot-Rolls-Out-the-Fakespot-Secure-Shopping-App-The-Best-Way-to-Shop-Amazon-on-Mobile-Devices.html"&gt;just over a month ago&lt;/a&gt;, and I can confirm it let you log in to Amazon, browse, and buy items with Fakespot’s overlay on top. I downloaded and tried it a few weeks ago to see if it could help spot fake reviews on some new purchases, but I didn’t come to a conclusion on whether it actually helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you to all of our users for making this new iOS app a reality. Together we will put an end to eCommerce fraud. We have more amazing products coming soon that will make secure shopping the gold standard for eCommerce.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/UyUnsOydzK"&gt;https://t.co/UyUnsOydzK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fakespot (@FakespotTweets) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FakespotTweets/status/1407028418970107904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OocBqg"&gt;But in mid-June, says Fakespot’s founder, Amazon initiated a takedown notice. And just hours ago, says Khalifah, Apple finally delivered a blunt three-line email about how it regretted that the situation couldn’t be resolved amicably and that Fakespot has now been removed from the App Store. “We just dedicated months of resources and time and money into this app,” says Khalifah. “Apple hasn’t even given us the ability to solve this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S39GGY"&gt;Hours after we published this story, Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that’s not exactly true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZHS71"&gt;“This was a dispute over intellectual property rights initiated by Amazon on June 8 and within hours we ensured both parties were in contact with one another, explaining the issue and steps for the developer to take to keep their app on the store and giving them ample time to resolve the issue. On June 29, we again reached out to Fakespot weeks before removing their app from the App Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fawnoh"&gt;Over the phone, Khalifah clarified that Apple did mention on June 29th that it “may be forced to pull” Fakespot from the App Store, but insists Apple never provided any other guidance, and that it was largely just conversation between Amazon and Fakespot where each argued their side before Apple yanked the app. “I’m shocked Apple decided to side with Amazon without any proof,” says Khalifah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHyiLM"&gt;Amazon tells us it believes Fakespot violated Apple guideline 5.2.2, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5.2.2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.2.2 Third-Party Sites/Services:&lt;/strong&gt; If your app uses, accesses, monetizes access to, or displays content from a third-party service, ensure that you are specifically permitted to do so under the service’s terms of use. Authorization must be provided upon request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HjJdjn"&gt;Amazon also tells us that Fakespot injects code into its website, opening up an attack vector and putting customer data (including email, addresses, credit card info, and your browser history) at risk, though it says it doesn’t actually know if Fakespot is using this information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5y16tw"&gt;“The app in question provides customers with misleading information about our sellers and their products, harms our sellers’ businesses, and creates potential security risks. We appreciate Apple’s review of this app against its Appstore guidelines,” reads a statement from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dt4S80"&gt;But while Fakespot admits the app injects code to display its own scores, he categorically denies there’s any vulnerability and points out that apps which include a web browser view are common — including coupon apps that Amazon seems to “have no problem with wrapping around a webview browser.” Amazon did, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21059083/amazon-honey-browser-extension-security-risk-paypal-acquisition-competition"&gt;try to warn against browser coupon extension Honey&lt;/a&gt; by suggesting it was a security risk last January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hbchv"&gt;Regardless of why, it’s a blow to one of the major outspoken critics of Amazon’s review system, as Fakespot is regularly cited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423429/amazon-top-reviewers-uk-fraud"&gt;in reports about review fraud on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon even bought search ads against the “Fakespot” keyword in the App Store to reduce the app’s potential impact:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGBOFMyACbWIRhRXF1Rd0BqSYa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722632/fakespot_amazon.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LLUezm"&gt;“Amazon is willing to bully little companies like ours that showcase the cracks in their company,” Khalifah says, suggesting Amazon must have realized people were choosing their app over the Amazon app. He says Fakespot racked up 150,000 installs from the iOS App Store, without spending any money on marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOgAwM"&gt;Amazon says it regularly audits companies that try to call out fake reviews and claims that Fakespot’s ratings are mostly wrong: “We regularly review products where Fakespot rated a product’s reviews as untrustworthy and their findings were wrong more than 80% of the time. They simply do not have the information we have—such as reviewer, seller and product history—to accurately determine the authenticity of a review.” Amazon suggests that it does a much better job of finding fake reviews itself by analyzing 30 million of them each week, though that clearly hasn’t stopped the fake and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;incentivized review problems&lt;/a&gt; yet — something we’re still investigating at &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2X4ttr"&gt;Amazon wouldn’t say if it’s contacted Google about the Android version of the app, but that app hasn’t been updated since 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7YXLU"&gt;Fakespot’s founder says the company is weighing its legal options now because it believes mobile is the future of shopping. “We’re seeing percentages of 60/40 now hovering in mobile’s favor,” Khalifah tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bcq3yp"&gt;“We will explore all the options we have available,” says Khalifah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emh2i5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:09PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added mention of browser coupon extension Honey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBVnSf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Apple statement and Fakespot’s reply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
