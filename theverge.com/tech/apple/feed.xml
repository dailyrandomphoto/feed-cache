    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mJ4Nkl"&gt;The performance of Apple’s M1 chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;exceeded our expectations&lt;/a&gt; and made the 2020 MacBook Air the most impressive laptop we’ve used in years (it’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;done wonders for the redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt;). So it’s not too surprising, as per &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this morning, that Apple is readying a whole slate of Macs using next-gen versions of the company’s in-house chips. The details sound very promising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbwIIR"&gt;The story, from reliable Apple-watcher Mark Gurman, says the company is preparing to unveil redesigned MacBook Pros in 14-inch and 16-inch screen sizes “as early as this summer.” Not only will the machines have a redesigned chassis, but they’ll also bring back the beloved magnetic MagSafe charger (though it’s not clear in what form) and previously excised inputs like the HDMI port and SD card slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOnICU"&gt;The return of the SD slot to the MacBook Pro — originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244398/apple-2021-macbook-pro-sd-card-slot-report-ports-refresh"&gt;rumored in January&lt;/a&gt; — will be extremely welcome for many professionals who use the port to quickly transfer videos and images from cameras’ SD cards. And though we’d seen reports that MagSafe might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;making a comeback for the MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, we didn’t know that MacBook Pro might be getting it, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZvciV"&gt;After the new MacBook Pros have been unveiled, Gurman says Apple plans to release “a revamped MacBook Air, new low-end MacBook Pro and an all-new Mac Pro workstation.” A higher-end Mac mini and larger iMac are also reportedly in the works, with all of the new machines boasting chips “that will greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,” according to Gurman’s anonymous sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEXfU7"&gt;Chips for the MacBook Pro will reportedly come in two variants, codenamed “Jade C-Chop” and “Jade C-Die.” Compared to the M1 chips — which have four high-performance cores, four energy-efficient cores, and eight graphics cores — the new designs will have eight high-performance cores, two energy-efficient cores, and either 16 or 32 graphics cores. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also says they’ll have an updated Neural Engine for machine learning tasks and support up to 64 gigabytes of memory compared to 16 gigabytes for the current M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J42sWJ"&gt;None of this is particularly shocking. We’d all expected the next generation of Apple’s in-house chips to be “the best ever” (as they always are, every year, per Apple’s marketing spiel), but it’s still good to hear that Apple is preparing such a wide-ranging overhaul of its Mac lineup. The M1 chip breathed new life into Apple’s computers, what might the M2 do next? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new iMac brings M1 goodness to the desktop</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A new design, new processor, and new screen make for a winning combination&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7EU4aE"&gt;This is an iMac unlike any other iMac we’ve seen before, and it all comes down to the M1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Vsjmw"&gt;Sure, there are some other differences between this 24-inch iMac and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18311920/apple-imac-27-21-5-2019-review-specs-features-price"&gt;21.5-inch model&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 that it’s replacing. There are better microphones and better speakers. There are fewer ports, and some of them have moved around. The screen is bigger and better. The keyboard now has TouchID. But the M1 is the star of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zrowl"&gt;It’s not just the performance increase. It’s not just the fact that you can run iOS and iPadOS apps natively on the system. It’s not just the new advanced image signal processor, which helps create better low-light images than I’ve ever seen from an integrated webcam. It’s also the groundbreaking efficiency with which this processor runs, which has enabled Apple to create a slim, sleek, and quite unique iMac chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oGUpSW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10505348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0fP9ib"&gt;Whether you actually get every upgrade here depends on the configuration you choose. The entry-level iMac is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-7-core-gpu-256gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299&lt;/a&gt; for 256GB of SSD storage, two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports, 8GB of unified memory, and a seven-core GPU — but that’s only available in four colors and doesn’t come with TouchID. The model I tested bumps the storage up to 512GB and the memory up to 16GB. It has two USB-3 ports in addition to the two Thunderbolt, an eight-core GPU, Touch ID, and a gigabit Ethernet port (which is in the power brick). I also received both the Magic Mouse and the Magic Trackpad with my model. You’d need to pay a total of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-512gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,028&lt;/a&gt; to get everything Apple sent me (and which I’ll be sending back, for the record). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaSzRz"&gt;In short, this device costs money. And it’s true that you’d get similar performance and save a few hundred bucks, if you just plugged a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; into an external display. But this iMac has almost everything that most people need in one package: processing power, sure, but also a camera, speakers, microphones, a keyboard, a mouse, a trackpad, and a display. And they’re all good. This is a computer you can plonk on your desk and never think about again. And for some of the iMac’s target audience, that’s probably worth the extra money. You’re paying for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UpRmCz9Ppj-0ehz9LDIpXBXeGCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521222/akrales_20210515_4583_0105.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iMac is completely redesigned, but instantly recognizable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7kPngM"&gt;The M1 processor uses what’s called a “hybrid” configuration. The easiest way to conceive of this is that most competing Intel and AMD chips have a number of equally “okay” cores, where Apple’s M1 has four very fast cores and four lower-powered high-efficiency cores. This allows M1 devices to deliver arguably the best performance-per-watt in the world. It also means that they’re nearly unbeatable in single-core workloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq56PF"&gt;That advantage bore out in our benchmark testing. This iMac model achieved a higher score on the Geekbench 5 single-core benchmark than &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks"&gt;any Mac&lt;/a&gt; we’ve ever seen before — even the &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/imac-pro-late-2017"&gt;iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt;. That means if you’re looking for a device for simpler everyday tasks that don’t scale to every available CPU core (and that largely seems to be the demographic that Apple is trying to sell this machine to), there has literally never been a better iMac for you to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LTQC7"&gt;You can see the rest of our benchmarks below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dwvoxG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10504220"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FbG1jZ"&gt;These results help illuminate where this iMac fits into Apple’s all-in-one lineup, and where its limitations are. The 24-incher is a significant improvement over the 21.5-inch &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/7833298"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; in both single-core and multi-core workloads. And it’s very comparable in &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/2820056"&gt;graphics&lt;/a&gt; tasks — which is quite impressive, given that the 21.5-inch iMac has a discrete GPU and this one relies on what’s integrated with the M1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn3FMw"&gt;On the other end, these results (with the exception of single-core performance) are not close to what we’d expect from the &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/2828013"&gt;27-inch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/imac-27-inch-retina-mid-2020-intel-core-i7-10700k-3-8-ghz-8-cores"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=38756"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; with discrete graphics. In this comparison, multi-core results are more important. They indicate that the 27-inch iMac is going to do much better on the types of tasks that owners (or prospective buyers) are likely to be doing: intense multitasking, computations, design, video work, and other more complex loads that may leverage the GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59K7fR"&gt;There are other limitations that may put some workloads out of reach. As is the case with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and Mac Mini, you can’t configure the iMac with more than 16GB of memory and 2TB of storage; we wouldn’t recommend those specs to anyone who regularly edits 4K or 8K video, for example. The memory and storage are soldered, so you can’t upgrade them after purchase. Only one external display is supported (up to 6K resolution at 60Hz). Ports are also bizarrely limited; the base model has just two Thunderbolt / USB-4 ports and a headphone jack, while more expensive models have an additional two USB-3 ports and Gigabit Ethernet. These all may be reasons Apple is pushing this iMac as a “home and family” PC, even though its processor is clearly capable of all kinds of professional work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRv0bG79h2KwzeQthF_qkXdCpR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521218/akrales_20210515_4583_0025.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M1 processor’s efficiency allows the iMac to get away with a thin design and minimal fan noise, and still maintain performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fmvaSR"&gt; Another way to interpret these numbers is that I was getting effectively the same performance out of this machine as we got from the M1 MacBook Pro and the Mac Mini. That’s completely unsurprising, since these devices all use the same processor. But it’s a good proxy for gauging whether the iMac can handle your work: if you expect you could get a task done with the M1 MacBook Pro, you should be able to do it on this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN8P9M"&gt;More anecdotally, I was able to use my test unit for all kinds of daily tasks, from emailing to YouTube to amateur photo and video work. I was able to hop between over 25 Chrome tabs with Cinebench looping in the background, with no stutter or slowdown whatsoever. If you’re buying the iMac for this kind of thing, I can’t imagine you’ll see too many spinning wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="q2t0Y1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The M1 processor in the iMac is just as capable as it is in the 13-inch MacBooks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b6Pxe8"&gt;During this testing process, I also got a sense of just how well cooled this chassis is. On thinner laptops that I test often (including the fanless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll see performance decrease if you run heavy tasks over and over again. None of that on this iMac: I looped Cinebench R23 as well as a Premiere Pro 4K video export several times over and never saw scores go down. It took a lot to get the fans going — they were checked out during my daily office multitasking. When they did spin up, mostly while I was working in Premiere, I could barely hear them. They were quieter than the background hum of my refrigerator. That’s quite a quality-of-life improvement over prior Intel iMacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNPpjB"&gt;The M1’s advantage, after all, has never been raw power; it’s the combination of power and efficiency. We saw much better battery life in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro than we did in their Intel predecessors. Battery life obviously isn’t a concern with the iMac, but efficiency certainly is. Chips are limited by two things: the power available and how well their systems can keep them cool. They vent almost all the energy they use as heat, and because the M1 has such incredibly high performance per watt, Apple doesn’t need a heavy-duty cooling system to keep it from frying itself. Because it doesn’t need that heavy-duty cooling system, Apple has finally been able to redesign the iMac from the ground up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LGQelZSqyCDpUfFGJ6BVlQlIDfM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521208/bfarsace_20210514_4583_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iMac’s chassis is so thin it looks like a big iPad minus the touchscreen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lgcBjS"&gt;This iMac is sleek. Even though it has a 24-inch screen, it’s close in size to its 21.5-inch predecessor. Apple reduced the screen’s borders by close to 50 percent in order to squeeze the bigger screen into the compact chassis. This device is also 11.5 millimeters thick, or just under half an inch — which is quite thin as all-in-ones go. Next to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356416/apple-imac-27-2020-review-price-specs-features"&gt;27-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like a tablet on a stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="GDimtP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10504858"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RZJbN7"&gt;Size isn’t everything; this iMac also comes in seven colors. There’s blue, green, pink, orange, purple, yellow, and the boring silver we know and love. I’m not quite convinced that the jazzier models will fit in outside of especially stylish homes and offices. But I will say: I’ve never seen so many of my friends, or so many people on TikTok, as excited about a tech product as they seem to be about the colored iMacs. The hues are a nice change, aren’t obnoxious, and are clearly a hit with certain crowds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzqNj3"&gt;Some traditional iMac touches remain, of course. The bezels are still substantial compared to those of some modern monitors. You can’t raise or lower the display height — the built-in stand only allows tilt adjustments. (You can also buy it with a built-in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac-vesa&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;VESA mount adapter&lt;/a&gt;.) And there’s still that pesky chin, though it’s no longer emblazoned with the Apple logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oKs4o"&gt;Pretty much every other notable part of the iMac has been upgraded in some way. There’s a 4.5K (4480 x 2520) Retina display, a step up from the predecessor’s 4096 x 2304 Retina display (though both have effectively the same pixel density). It has Apple’s True Tone technology, which automatically adjusts colors and intensity based on your surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItlCCp"&gt;But the screen is also another reminder that this iMac doesn’t have “Pro” in its name. Twenty-four inches is on the small side as screens go; most of the best external monitors are 27 inches or larger these days. Professionals on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s video team also noticed some vignetting on the sides of the screen, which caused issues with off-angle viewing — we had a similar issue with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;Apple’s Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, neither of these limitations were a problem for my untrained eye; I thought the display looked great, with sharp details and plenty of room for my Chrome tabs and apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKKf6W"&gt;Elsewhere, Apple has upgraded the camera, microphones, and speakers. The company claims that they’re the best camera, mic system, and speaker system that have ever appeared in a Mac. I’d believe it. The six-speaker sound system is easily on par with a good external speaker. I played some music in my kitchen, and it was audible all over the house. Percussion and bass were strong, and I felt very immersed in the songs. It also supports spatial audio when playing video with Dolby Atmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new camera has a higher resolution and better picture quality for video calls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are just two or four USB-C ports on the new iMac, depending on configuration. You’re going to need dongles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power adapter is now external, like a MacBook, but it conveniently includes an Ethernet port&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LHanB4"&gt;I don’t have too much to say about the three-mic array except that nobody on my Zoom calls had any trouble hearing me. But the webcam was a very pleasant surprise. The iMac has a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, which has a higher resolution than the 720p shooter that lives in the 21.5-inch iMac (as well as the MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and many other AIOs). The M1 also lends a hand here: its built-in image signal processor and neural engines help optimize your picture in low-light settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkDq3B"&gt;I wouldn’t say I looked &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; on my Zoom calls — parts of my background were sometimes washed out, and the image looked processed in some dimmer areas. But I was visible and clear, which is better than you get from most webcams these days. And the difference between this webcam and the grainy mess the MacBook Pro has is night and day. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LEFbdsaGxN98UQu-vdJOMEUUbUs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521209/bfarsace_20210514_4583_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iMac is the computer to get if you just want to buy it and not think about it for the next five to ten years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aIC4vt"&gt;When I review a computer, my task is usually to figure out for whom that computer is made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1SSY8"&gt;But all kinds of people use iMacs, from college students to accountants to podcast producers to retired grandparents. And this model has arguably the most widespread consumer appeal of any iMac that Apple has made in recent years. So it’s much easier to figure out for whom this iMac &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1duJQ"&gt;It’s not for people who can’t handle dongles and docks; I kept a USB-C to USB-A dongle next to me on my desk while I was testing the iMac, and I used it &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;frequently. It’s not for people who already own a 27-inch iMac, because it would be a downgrade in display size and quality, port selection, upgradability, and raw power. And it’s not for people with serious performance needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jNnmQ"&gt;It’s not for people who are looking for the very best value for their money. Most folks won’t need the specs and accessories that I tested here, but even $1,299, the base price, is certainly more than plenty of people want to spend on a computer. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini%2Fapple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-256gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is $600 cheaper than the base iMac; plug that into a monitor and some speakers (you can find plenty of good ones for well under $600), and you’ll get the same M1 performance at a massive discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="baWViv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’re paying for the iMac’s simplicity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5Uui4"&gt;And that, right there, is the biggest reason that this iMac, despite its power, is primarily targeting the family market. Because it’s asking you to pay more in order to do less. You’re paying $600 not to have to research and budget out monitors, speakers, webcams, docks, keyboards, and mice. You’re paying not to have to arrange thousands of things on your desk. You’re paying for a device where everything, out of the box, works well. You’re paying to eliminate fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPGV2A"&gt;Tech enthusiasts (especially those who want to pop their machines open and make their own upgrades) may see that as a waste of money. And for them, it probably is. But they’re not the target audience for this Mac — even if its specs might suit their needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="STI36u"&gt;Could Apple have done more with this iMac? Of course. I was hoping to see a 30-inch, 6K iMac with a powerhouse 12-core workstation chip this month as much as the next person. But I have faith that we’ll get one in the future — and in the meantime, I’m glad Apple released this. It’s not earth-shattering in its design; it doesn’t redefine its category. But it’s fun. It improves upon the 21.5-inch iMac to offer a simple, attractive, and very functional device for users across all kinds of categories. It’s not the iMac to beat — but it is the iMac for most people to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7B2un5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple HomePod and HomePod mini can’t play lossless Apple Music, either</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wpQZWb"&gt;Today, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;Apple’s ultra-premium $550 AirPods Max headphones aren’t ready for the new lossless audio catalog&lt;/a&gt; coming to Apple Music next month — and they’re not alone. Apple confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the HomePod and HomePod mini won’t support lossless audio, either. (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/homepod-wont-support-lossless-audio/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; confirmed the same thing with sources&lt;/a&gt; earlier this afternoon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brjFbG"&gt;The good news is that the HomePod and HomePod mini will indeed support the company’s new &lt;em&gt;spatial&lt;/em&gt; audio experiences, which are supposed to provide more immersive audio than a standard stereo or virtual surround mix — we were fairly intrigued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;trying spatial audio on the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s also coming to Apple Music next month in a bigger way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z13Cjy"&gt;And, Apple says, it’s not like any of these devices will fail to play back lossless tracks completely. They simply won’t be playing them at lossless quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNasQp"&gt;Still, it seems like one more reason that Apple should really strongly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434783/apple-homepod-stock-problems-discontinued-sale"&gt;consider having a fire sale for the original HomePod&lt;/a&gt;, which is somehow still available for a increasingly hard-to-justify $300 months after officially being discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Phil Schiller gives Epic iPhone testimony</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Trial With Epic Threatens To Reveal App Store’s Commission Bounty" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0gRFHHDFdCsbRL8vZvs0WOukzLk=/0x0:2738x1825/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69302193/1232892504.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;What does ‘locked in’ mean, though?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cbiQUK"&gt;We’ve gotten through the expert witnesses of &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, and as a reward, Phil Schiller — currently an “Apple Fellow,” whatever that is, and previously the senior vice president of worldwide marketing — took the stand like a twinkly App Store St. Nick. To hear him tell it, Apple is a wonderful partner to developers, selflessly improving dev tools and responding to their needs. At times the testimony feels like a prolonged ad for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="167QOY"&gt;The goal of the testimony is to paint the App Store as a part of the iPhone that can’t be removed or replaced by a competing alternative. To this end, we heard in exhaustive detail about the improvements made to the iPhone that benefit the developers in the App Store. The chips. The Retina display. The accelerometer. The wireless upgrades. It’s practically an Apple event on the stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlcpDk"&gt;Among the exhaustive list, Schiller identified Metal, one of the developer tools Apple created. (Metal is a play on “close to the metal,” or writing code that’s close to the computer’s guts.) Apple’s counsel says the lawyer version of “roll tape!” and we’re treated to a 20 second clip of Tim Sweeney on stage at WWDC, praising Metal as a wonderful tool that will allow developers like Epic Games to create the next generation of improvements. Solid burn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YVz0CV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Schiller’s testimony spends some quality time back in 2007&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRIZcI"&gt;The overall impression I get from the list of improvements is, essentially, that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; absolutely could not have launched on the first generation of iPhones — the hardware and chips couldn’t have handled the game. That is true! Also: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;didn’t exist yet, so that’s a pretty good reason it couldn’t have been on those early iPhones. But there is another reason a time-traveling &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; couldn’t have launched on the first iPhones in 2007: the App Store didn’t exist yet, either. This particular fact is somewhat inconvenient for Apple’s argument that the iPhone and the App Store are inseparable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKRVeo"&gt;Schiller’s testimony spends some quality time back in 2007, to explain the origin of the App Store. When the iPhone launched, the only apps on it were Apple’s own; all other apps were web apps. In response, there was a spate of “jailbreaking” — essentially, hacking the iPhone so you could put your own apps on it. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; was the genesis of the App Store: Apple realizing that people were going to put their own apps on the iPhone no matter what it did. If it wanted control of the process, it was going to have to create an official route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOIOKP"&gt;From the jump, security was going to be a concern, Schiller said. After all, the point of the phone was that you could &lt;em&gt;carry it around&lt;/em&gt; — which involved collecting location data. So iOS was built from the ground up with this in mind, Schiller says. (This line of testimony is a rebuttal to Epic’s argument that MacOS allows side-loading, and it is therefore anticompetitive that iOS does not.) To put a stop to the jailbreaking, Apple did something unusual: rather than showing the world a finished product, it announced it was &lt;em&gt;working on something&lt;/em&gt;. That something was the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="dpS1zb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Look, “locked in” has an accepted meaning, and it’s not a very friendly one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ey5O2Q"&gt;The Steve Jobs line that Epic has touted — ”We don’t intend to make money off the App Store” — comes from these early days. At the time of this announcement, Apple didn’t know if it would make money, Schiller testified. He also suggests that the line was not a promise that Apple would &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;make money. The App Store was a “huge” risk, Schiller said. “We’re taking our hot new product and putting something we’ve never done before on it, and we have no apps yet! So we have no idea how this is going to do.” This is credible. What is less convincing is Schiller’s attempt to redefine what it means to “lock customers into our ecosystem,” a phrase that comes from a Jobs email entered into evidence earlier in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lX3kF0"&gt;Look, “locked in” has an accepted meaning, and it’s not a very friendly one: prisoners, for example, are locked in. Schiller gives this the old college try anyhow, telling the court that the idea behind “locked in” was just to make services more attractive, so that customers wouldn’t want to leave. Later in the email, Jobs talks about making the ecosystem even more “sticky,” which is less menacing, but — glue traps are sticky. So are flystrips. When was the last time that being stuck to something was positive for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4b3Eox"&gt;But hey, Schiller’s a marketer. He was Apple’s marketing guy for &lt;em&gt;actual decades&lt;/em&gt;! Always be closing, baby. And so if it at times seemed like he presented Apple as though it were a selfless do-gooder, responding to devs’ requests for in-app payments — which was a then-nascent business — by building capability for that into the store, well, that’s his job. Still, presenting one of the most ruthlessly efficient cash machines in tech as a helpful friend of small developers is kind of like painting a whale shark orange and calling it a goldfish who feeds other goldfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9PVvV"&gt;Despite Schiller’s friendly demeanor, some of his testimony is a stretch. For instance, he says he doesn’t see mobile as a duopoly. He lists Samsung, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon as competition. The Amazon Fire phone was discontinued in 2015, as was the Windows Phone. Perhaps they haunt his dreams, but they certainly don’t haunt the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VbCnf0"&gt;But Schiller mostly does what he needs to do for Apple — as I suppose he has for 30-odd years. He’s cheerful, pleasant to listen to, and at times, very convincing. The question in this case, though, is if marketing to a judge is as easy as marketing to Apple customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $549 AirPods Max can’t play lossless Apple Music — even when plugged in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69d9CKC7JVxP7_zIM1EuPJy81d0=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301267/DSCF2705_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r06i0y"&gt;Streaming music might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;entering a new era of hi-fi audio&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple’s AirPods Max aren’t technically ready to go along for the ride. The company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its premium noise-canceling headphones do not natively support playback of lossless music files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnkub0"&gt;“Lossless audio is not supported on AirPods, any model,” an Apple spokesperson said by email. “AirPods Max wired listening mode accepts analog output sources only. AirPods Max currently does not support digital audio formats in wired mode.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq6ELI"&gt;It makes complete sense that the AirPods and AirPods Pro have no way of playing lossless audio. They’re totally wireless, and Apple supports the AAC codec over Bluetooth. AAC sounds plenty good, but it’s nowhere near the bit rate of CD-quality or high-resolution tracks. To do any better, Apple would need to come up with some new wireless codec — its own version of Sony’s LDAC, sort of — or make these things play music over Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth. None of that is happening today or by June when Apple Music will start offering lossless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shjiBP"&gt;Things are a little more complicated with the AirPods Max, which &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be plugged into audio sources with a cable. However, it turns out that even if you have Apple’s $35 Lightning-to-3.5mm cable plugged into a device that’s streaming lossless Apple Music tracks, you’re not going to hear the full audio fidelity of the source. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfLJy784kh1AUCVTFVHU8pIrOkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159226/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max don’t support digital audio formats when hard wired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qijZy4"&gt;So the natural question becomes... well, what &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you hearing in that scenario? Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that when you play a 24-bit / 48 kHz Apple Music lossless track from an iPhone into the AirPods Max using both the cable and Lightning dongle, the audio is converted to analog and then re-digitized to 24-bit / 48 kHz. That re-digitization step is the reason that Apple can’t say you’re hearing pure lossless audio; it’s not an identical match to the source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoOJMd"&gt;Is it still going to sound very good? Almost certainly. The AirPods Max sound exceptional — even with AAC over Bluetooth, and plugging in can make the experience richer. But if you’re a stickler for the technical details, this is why the AirPods Max can’t pull off lossless audio in the truest sense. It also leaves Apple in an awkward spot where other high-end headphones that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; support digital audio when hard wired — over USB-C, for example — could deliver the full lossless audio that the AirPods Max can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4HjWj"&gt;The Apple Music spatial audio feature also announced today &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; work on the AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. So any songs that have those Dolby Atmos mixes are going to feel more immersive than their stereo counterparts. I think Apple suspects spatial audio will be a bigger deal for many customers than lossless quality — and it may be right. But hopefully the company also has a long-term plan for increasing the fidelity on its wireless headphones, especially now that lossless doesn’t cost anything extra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAZH5y"&gt;Apple also tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the HomePod and HomePod mini speakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441305/lossless-apple-music-homepod-homepod-mini"&gt;won’t support lossless audio&lt;/a&gt; — however, they will support spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1uaKK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 17th, 8:48PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added confirmation from Apple that the HomePod and HomePod mini don’t support lossless audio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants you to know it chose not to take a cut of $400 billion in physical goods </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="phil schiller stock 2015" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRuNIiR8ZxOfS5m6Tc5J9TCzqA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300846/verge-2015-09-09_12-31-45.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUS15t"&gt;Apple is trying to convince a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423567/apple-epic-app-store-policies-fortnite-trial-day-4"&gt;that it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; milking the App Store for all it’s worth&lt;/a&gt;, and today the company dropped some big numbers to help make its case. Apple claims that its App Store drove $400 billion worth of physical purchases in a single year in 2019, and that — unlike digital purchases and subscriptions — Apple doesn’t take a cent of that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMyZWo"&gt;That’s according to App Store boss and longtime Apple marketing exec Phil Schiller, who also testified that the company spends a staggering $50 million a year to throw its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event. The company’s also building a new developer center at its Apple Loop headquarters in Cupertino, he says, though I didn’t catch how much the company’s investing in that. None of these are included in the App Store’s budget, Schiller testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ok6hdJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Schiller says in 2019 App Store drove $400 billion+ in transactions of physical goods, so food delivery, Amazon, Uber/Lyft, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Judge interjects. “Billion with a b?” It’s a big number, and Schiller confirms Apple doesn’t take a cut of that.&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Statt (@nickstatt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1394363213932863488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kScH5F"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Schiller’s going over the explanation Apple has given before for why it doesn’t take a commission on physical goods: it can’t guarantee they actually arrive. (This logic goes for things like Lyft/Uber as well, per earlier discussion.)&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1394362691859492869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6t7Er"&gt;Why isn’t Apple trying to take a cut of physical purchases? During his testimony, Schiller explained that Apple couldn’t guarantee they would actually arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9F1N9L"&gt;But I also imagine it might have been a hard sell with developers: can Apple really argue that it drove those $400 billion in purchases by itself? If I’m going to buy something online, I’ll probably start by whipping out my phone, but I’ve got a laptop with a perfectly good web browser right here to buy those same items, if an app doesn’t immediately do the job. Amazon knows this, and used it to bypass Apple’s digital cut on movies and shows, too, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"&gt;until it got a better deal&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller"&gt;Digital books are a different matter&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

Apple seems to attempting to argue that because things like WWDC aren’t included in the App Store’s costs, the real profit margin is lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oqDxaI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;basically, we are establishing in the law’s tedious way there are lots of App Store benefits that aren’t really… the App Store itself. attempting to undermine Epic’s claims about the profit margin, and establish that the App Store can’t be separated from the phone itself.&lt;/p&gt;— Elizabeth Lopatto (@mslopatto) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mslopatto/status/1394410945896607745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dXfgHH"&gt;Schiller testified that 84 percent of all App Store apps are completely free, with roughly 75 percent of all games on the App Store completely free. Of those games, approximately 17 percent are freemium (requiring in-app purchases to unlock content) and 6 percent are paid, leaving just 2 percent on a subscription model if we do the math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WH4w2j"&gt;Schiller also said today that Apple has spent $100 billion on research and development over the past fifteen years, $18 billion of that just last year in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr8LMI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 6:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added line and embedded tweet about the point Apple appears to be trying to make today by touting all of its investments in the iPhone and iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unannounced Beats Studio Buds appear in Apple’s latest beta software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZn4KWrHQuA-cJuq6ZJjQ6McE0c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300318/DSCF5800.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YVUMMi"&gt;Aside from churning out some limited edition colors, Beats has been in a bit of a quiet period since the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;the Beats Flex last October&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems that the Apple-owned brand is preparing to launch some new, high-end earbuds. As spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are images of “Beats Studio Buds” in the latest beta releases of iOS and tvOS. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/17/exclusive-these-are-apples-new-truly-wireless-in-ear-beats-studio-earbuds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also uncovered images of the charging case and some system animations of the earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0cddl"&gt;The unannounced earbuds look much different than the Powerbeats Pro, which have become a popular pick among the fitness crowd. These don’t have any ear hooks whatsoever, and they seem to have a diagonal steam that extends slightly upward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cRM2SAivqimLhJi-GGG5tQc_CXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520853/beats.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwUzHB"&gt;These images being included in “release candidate” builds of Apple’s software could mean that the Beats Studio Buds are due to be announced in the near future. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Beats for comment. According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;, the code pertaining to the earbuds confirms they’ll have noise cancellation, which is something that all Beats earbuds currently lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnnNfQ"&gt;Apple is also expected to update its main AirPods earbuds sometime this year with a revamped design featuring shortened stems and other aesthetic details borrowed from the AirPods Pro. But they’re likely to retain the hard plastic, one-size-fits-most fit. Beats, however, seems to be sticking with silicone tips for an in-ear seal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GisLML"&gt;Beats has been going through a transition period after former president Luke Wood departed Apple last year. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/05/14/apple-beats-isnt-dead-yet-with-new-designer-reportedly-designing-new-products"&gt;Recently, it’s been rumored&lt;/a&gt; that Scott Croyle, formerly of HTC, is playing a significant role in Beats hardware design. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to make an AirTag holder for your pet’s collar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzttfcZZg-DE7iVzlfQ8d3zQmGM=/0x88:2040x1448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298626/verge_IMG_7566_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hank being a good boy with an AirTag sleeve fitted to his existing dog collar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocCNe3"&gt;One seemingly obvious use for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag&amp;amp;sharedid=vergeairtagholderpet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29 AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt; is for pets. As a new dog owner, I wanted to add an AirTag to my dog’s existing leather collar, but the options currently available are lousy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjrJAr"&gt;AirTags are small, but they’re not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; small. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fairtag&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22439970%2Fpet-airtag-holder-dog-cat-collar-how-to-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Most AirTag holders&lt;/a&gt; currently available from Apple and its partners assume I’m okay with dangling a 0.39-ounce (11-gram) pendant off my medium-sized beagle’s neck. I’m not, which is how I came up with the idea for a DIY neoprene sleeve that keeps the IP67 water- and dust-resistant AirTag snuggly attached to Hank’s existing collar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mE3gf7"&gt;I’m not going to suggest that AirTags are the best way to track your pets — they’re not. But they’re relatively cheap, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-gps-pet-trackers/"&gt;dedicated GPS / GSM pet trackers&lt;/a&gt; that require monthly subscriptions. Apple’s Find My network coverage is also more limited. Nevertheless, an AirTag is better than nothing, especially in populated areas where any nearby iPhone can alert you to your missing pet’s location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="K7nISO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kZy_FBQ2NrPfmtHmQwYAGs9D_ro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519991/verge_IMG_7489_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sewn version of the AirTag sleeve and the dog collar it was designed for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F26NeP"&gt;Why not buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6OfWYP"&gt;A few companies have already announced AirTag accessories designed specifically for pets. The problem is that none of them are currently shipping, and most are downright expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ldl1as"&gt;There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeAirpodPetTags&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-pet-tag-airtag-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29.95 Nomad Rugged Pet Tag&lt;/a&gt; case, which can be engraved with your phone number for an extra $19.95. But it’s still just a pendant and doesn’t ship until August. There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.studioproper.com.au/products/dogtag"&gt;€19.95 Studio Proper DogTag&lt;/a&gt; that fits snuggly to existing collars but doesn’t ship until the end of July. And finally, there’s the expensive &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.followpaw.com%2Fproducts%2Ffollowpaw-dog-collar&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22439970%2Fpet-airtag-holder-dog-cat-collar-how-to-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$47.95 FollowPaw collar&lt;/a&gt; with built-in AirTag pocket, which doesn’t ship until June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGyXkk"&gt;One day, I’ll probably buy a dedicated AirTag holder for my dog — one that fits snuggly to his existing collar and comes engraved with his name and my phone number so that I can remove his redundant dog tag. Until then, DIY seems like the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtE_EAbr5Un32piTYC01K4HwHtY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519973/verge_IMG_7515_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll need scissors, neoprene fabric, and either neoprene glue (easy!) or the ability to sew (easy for some!).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YkkKlo"&gt;Materials needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IH6UIl"&gt;My AirTag sleeve is built from neoprene, a durable and stretchy material that’s easy to find. I’d suggest buying it from a local crafts or fabric store so you can check out the colors, thicknesses, and stretchiness in person. You might even be able to haggle for a few free scraps instead of buying in bulk as required by most Amazon sellers. The neoprene I used is 2mm thick and lacks any additional waterproofing, allowing it to be soft and stretchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3H7Irx"&gt;If sewing isn’t an option, then you’ll need some neoprene glue. As an avid surfer, I had easy access to scraps of neoprene, which I could assemble into a tube with the neoprene glue in my wetsuit repair kit. For everyone else, you can expect the glue and neoprene to cost no more than $10 in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EKn0AK"&gt;Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="bmAvKk"&gt;Cut the neoprene into a rectangle about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) in length and wide enough to wrap snugly around your pet’s existing collar with enough overlapping material to either glue or sew it into place. A longer tube might help prevent the AirTag from popping out over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="Xf6DhZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10504284"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KsQjok"&gt;Shape into a tube that just fits the width of the pet collar and then glue or sew the neoprene into shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="Njzclo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10504291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rVM5Yu"&gt;Slide the collar through the tube, then slowly work the AirTag into one end of the neoprene sleeve until it is centered. It helps to rotate the AirTag as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FNNAjX"&gt;Attach to dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Amazon stops charging extra for lossless music as Apple enters the fray</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tm0pn5XlTNwwYyvAmjOSZLokV1U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298248/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UN6rLG"&gt;Faced with new competition from Apple, Amazon today announced that it will no longer charge an added fee for the “HD” tier of Amazon Music that lets customers stream audio at CD quality and above. From now on, lossless audio will be available to all Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers at no extra charge. &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9573513/amazon-music-hd-unlimited-hi-fi-price-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; was first to report the development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ki5Wg"&gt;This makes Amazon the first company to offer lossless music at the industry’s standard $9.99 subscription rate. Amazon Music Unlimited is even cheaper ($7.99 per month) for Prime customers. And yes, the high-quality audio will also now be available for customers paying that price. Family plans are eligible for Amazon Music HD at no added cost, but student plans are exempt. Before Amazon entered the picture, the going rate for a lossless music subscription was $19.99; that’s what Tidal continues to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jByEyy"&gt;What’s making this change possible? Well, as &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; points out, with all the music streaming heavyweights now going in on lossless audio, music labels care more about pushing up subscriber count totals across these services than the higher subscription premiums that they previously demanded for hi-res audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f77R4W"&gt;The price drop for Amazon Music HD comes on the very same day Apple announced the launch of lossless audio on Apple Music. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439885/apple-music-tease-hi-fi-lossless-music-streaming"&gt;teased significant news&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend after rumors began swirling late last week about the possibility. The company’s Apple Music Android app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;spilled the details a bit early&lt;/a&gt; and signaled that an announcement could be imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZkkTB"&gt;Amazon Music HD has been performing strongly for Amazon. A previous &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; report said the service is up 100 percent year over year. The service offers over 70 million songs in CD quality, with over 7 million exceeding that and available in “ultra HD” quality. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces lossless Apple Music is coming in June at no added cost</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wvFk2LBC5fkulgzL0s-p--sSWlA=/0x0:2490x1660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298201/applemusic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIrmwc"&gt;Apple Music is getting two big updates next month: support for high-quality, lossless audio and for spatial audio through Dolby Atmos. But even more surprising, the features will be available for free to all subscribers, including those on family and student plans. The company says it’ll have 75 million lossless audio songs in its catalog by the end of the year and 20 million to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swGTf9"&gt;Apple has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that lossless audio is exclusive to Apple Music and thus subscription-only. The company won’t offer music purchases in lossless quality, nor will there be any way to upgrade owned tracks to lossless with the paid iTunes Match service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ZY83"&gt;To turn on lossless audio, subscribers must run the latest version of Apple Music and can go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Audio Quality. There, they can opt into different resolutions for different connections, like cellular, Wi-Fi, or for download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8F2ptn"&gt;Apple Music’s lossless audio starts at CD quality, which is 16 bit at 44.1 kHz, and goes up to 24 bit at 48 kHz natively on Apple devices. It tops out at 24 bit at 192 kHz. For the highest-quality “High-Resolution Lossless” experience, there’s one major catch: subscribers will need external equipment like a DAC to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiJjoi"&gt;Spatial audio and Dolby Atmos audio could prove to be an even bigger deal for Apple Music listeners. It’ll provide more immersive mixes for anyone listening through recent AirPods or Beats headphones that use the H1 or W1 chip. Spatial audio will also play through the built-in speakers on the latest versions of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac by default. To turn it on for other headphones, users will have to go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Audio and set Dolby Atmos to “Always On.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WP2Mt3"&gt;Spatial audio will be compatible with most Apple devices made in the last few years, including the Apple TV 4K connected to a compatible TV or receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DF8j3E"&gt;Lossless audio is now becoming standard across the biggest music streaming apps.
