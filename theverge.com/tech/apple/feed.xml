    <title>Apple’s upcoming macOS 12.1 update will fix the MacBook Pro’s notch and menu bar issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7MdMDA"&gt;Apple’s upcoming macOS 12.1 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"&gt;will fix some odd interactions&lt;/a&gt; between its new MacBook Pros’ notched displays and menu bar apps, which should no longer be blocked behind the notch, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/macos-12-1-fixes-notch-obscuring-menu-bar-icons/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1U6zX"&gt;Previously, some users had reported issues where menu bar icons could end up getting pushed behind the notch in the event that too many were open. Or, as Apple’s changelog describes the issue, prior to macOS 12.1, “[menu] bar extras may be obscured by the camera housing on 2021 MacBook Pro computers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ttbR5Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple seems to have forgotten it built a notch in the MacBook Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="CRGxsh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WTF HAHAHAHA HOW IS THIS SHIPPABLE? WHAT IS THIS?! &lt;a href="https://t.co/epse3Cv3xF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/epse3Cv3xF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Quinn Nelson (@SnazzyQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143510111059968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VtDbB8"&gt;The bug admittedly was rare to begin with, requiring that users had enough menu bar icons (referred to by Apple as “menu bar extras”) to reach from the right side of the display to the notch’s location, but particularly large menu bar apps (like iStat Menus) could accomplish the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ula5Va"&gt;In addition to fixing the menu bar / notch bug, the new update also brings a few other issues, including HDR problems with YouTube and MagSafe bugs on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7IiAG"&gt;macOS 12.1 is still in beta, but given that the company has seeded the release candidate version of the software to developers, the update (and the bug fix for the notch issues) should be rolling out to all users in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will pay for Jennifer Lawrence to play Elizabeth Holmes in new Theranos film</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortune Global Forum - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pxoo7k-7HQrQf9OJFIaNGabPaLA=/0x0:2627x1751/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70246655/495430024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for Fortune&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L3yGHn"&gt;Apple says it will produce a movie about former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, with Jennifer Lawrence of &lt;em&gt;Hunger Games &lt;/em&gt;fame in the starring role. The movie, to be directed by &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; creator Adam McKay, will be based on the bestselling book &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup&lt;/em&gt; by former &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter John Carreyrou. He &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;wrote the first news stories&lt;/a&gt; detailing Theranos’ problems, even as the company and Holmes were being lauded in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfmkHy"&gt;Holmes is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22792606/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-witness-stand-surprise"&gt;currently on trial&lt;/a&gt; facing 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud after it was discovered that Theranos’ blood testing technology didn’t meet the standards it claimed to investors. At the time of its unraveling, Theranos was valued at $9 billion, and Holmes was labeled the youngest self-made billionaire and featured on &lt;em&gt;Fortune’s&lt;/em&gt; 40 under 40 list. Later in 2016, Holmes &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2016/03/30/most-disappointing-leaders/"&gt;was named&lt;/a&gt; one of the world’s most disappointing leaders. She faces up to 20 years in prison, if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VO77Ec"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Elizabeth Holmes is on trial for fraud over her time at Theranos ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684354/elizabeth-holmes-trial-wire-fraud-theranos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OJkkmb"&gt;The film is the another confirmed project about the Theranos scandal. Earlier this year, Hulu confirmed that it would be making &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/amanda-seyfried-elizabeth-holmes-the-dropout-hulu-theranos-kate-mckinnon-1234723500/"&gt;a docuseries&lt;/a&gt; starring Amanda Seyfried.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s excellent Smart Thermostat is even more affordable today </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-rikk4ve-Dbaex2opcFzYLFT5Tg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244108/jtuohy_211115_4885_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the Alexa app to control Amazon’s Smart Thermostat, which is currently enjoying its first discount.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="85aJOu"&gt;Even without a discount attached to it, Amazon’s surprisingly great Smart Thermostat is a good deal in itself. After our reviewer spent a decade testing almost every smart thermostat since the launch of the Nest Learning Thermostat, she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; it to be one of the best yet. That’s saying a lot, and it’s pretty impressive given this is an affordable smart thermostat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJWOjc"&gt;The thermostat is discounted for the first time today, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $47.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; — a 20 percent discount on its typical $59.99. Built in collaboration with Resideo, the makers of Honeywell Home Thermostat Technology, this gadget is capable of learning and adapting to your schedule, just like more expensive thermostats out there. With the price in mind, it does lack some features. Perhaps the most egregious omission is that it doesn’t integrate with platforms or voice assistants besides Alexa. Yet, if you’re looking for a good basic thermostat with which you can control the temperature of your home (even while traveling), this is definitely worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="took9t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SE0OPc"&gt;Sonos is offering great deals on its refurbished products through December 31st. You can buy, for example, the latest generation of the Sonos One for &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeDeals120821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fone-b-stock.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $100 less than its full $219 retail cost when purchased new. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/18/16490866/sonos-one-speaker-review-alexa"&gt;first-generation&lt;/a&gt; is also on sale for $129, but lacks Bluetooth Low Energy support, has a slower processor, and comes with less memory than the second-gen. Meanwhile, the first-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Sonos Beam&lt;/a&gt; soundbar is selling for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8532386-11556673?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fbeam-white-b-stock.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$259&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to $399, the price when purchased new. While it lacks Dolby Atmos support like the second-gen model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; it’s still a competent smart speaker that shares many features in common with the newer version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZAD3l"&gt;All of the discounted refurbished products will arrive in a box with the original accessories and cables. They’ve also been certified directly from Sonos, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21530290/refurbished-tech-products-gadgets-where-to-buy-amazon-ebay"&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; the company has tested and given each an internal and external cleaning and inspection. Each product also comes with a one-year warranty and a 45-day money-back guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N3fELm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="TMUytT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDSO0B"&gt;If you prefer earbuds to bulkier headphones, you might want to grab the second-gen Apple AirPods at Amazon since they’re just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99&lt;/a&gt;. That matches its second-lowest price after we saw the earbuds drop to $89 during early Black Friday sales. It’s also a lower price than what we saw on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when they were selling for around $110. Typically around $129, this model offers excellent wireless performance, reliable battery life, and is easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zVYh9F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y89YAm"&gt;If you’ve got a little more cash to spare, and you’re in the market for a pair of excellent over-ear headphones, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals120821"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; is bundling Sony’s WH-1000XM4 with Mophie’s Power Boost XXL 20,800mAh battery power bank for just $248. That matches the Black Friday and Cyber Monday price many retailers sold the $349.99 headphones for just by themselves. Mophie’s power bank typically sells for $39.95 itself, so this bundle is valued at around $390. Plus, the bundle also includes a small microfiber cleaning cloth to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6501a"&gt;As we noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; (and as you’ve probably read in our deals coverage many times before), Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM4 boast the company’s best noise-canceling capabilities yet. We gave the headphones a 9/10 partly because of it, along with their stellar comfort, sound quality, and the fact they also let you connect to two Bluetooth sources simultaneously (this was missing in the XM3). Meanwhile, Mophie’s portable power bank comes with two USB-A ports so you can charge your headphones and phone simultaneously, and it charges via Micro USB. The company claims as well that its 20,800mAh battery offers up to 77 hours of extra battery life, but note we haven’t tested this product, so we can’t confirm if this is truly the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQfWTW"&gt;Of course, if you prefer to just buy the headphones by themselves, many are still selling them for just $248, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2gyfQV3mV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="90yl6V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907261"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezhNoP"&gt;Govee’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Immersion TV LED backlights&lt;/a&gt; are fun, colorful lights that can make watching movies and gaming look more immersive. They sync to the colors on your screen (it supports 55- to 65-inch TVs) to make it appear as if its bezels have disappeared and the colors are expanding onto your walls. In other words, they’ll make for some pretty cool holiday gifts. Govee’s backlighting kit released in 2020 is back on sale at Amazon. For a limited time, you can pick one up for just $63.99 once you clip the $20 off coupon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the product’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsGMEZ"&gt;Govee is also selling this product direct &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/immersion-tv-backlights" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $62.99&lt;/a&gt; as a part of its holiday sale, which is a little cheaper. Still, if you prefer to shop from Amazon or are a Prime member, the Amazon deal could be the better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="plsQMm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10681491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zH8SZ"&gt;For those still trying to nab a PlayStation 5 — or for those lucky enough to already have one — one of our picks for the best SSDs compatible with the PS5 is currently at its best price ever. Normally $229.99, Amazon is selling the 1TB version of Samsung’s 980 Pro for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLX7TNT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169.99&lt;/a&gt; instead. That’s a $60 discount on Samsung’s blazingly fast SSD, which is one of the few kinds of drives on the market that meet Sony’s performance requirements. It’s also compatible with PC, though you’ll only get its advertised PCIe 4.0 speeds if you have a compatible motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyhOxD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="NPAcho"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The PlayStation 5 will be available for Walmart Plus members on Wednesday","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821037/ps5-playstation-5-restock-available-walmart-plus-queue-deal-sale"},{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall isn’t worthwhile at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VzJPoI"&gt;Shifting away from SSDs to gaming controllers, Razer’s Kishi is a great gift for gamers on the go traveling this holiday season. You can clamp it onto your Android phone and easily transform it into a Nintendo Switch lookalike. It’s also compatible with many games available on a variety of cloud-based gaming platforms, including Google Stadia, Microsoft xCloud, and more. It’s typically a bit pricey at $79.99, but right now both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9PMTEDGaM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086X8DHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are taking nearly 50 percent off, selling it for $44.99 instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wf8m22"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882522"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CH57MS"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other notable deals happening:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="title"&gt;If you’re an iPhone 12 Mini owner, Amazon is selling Apple’s black MagSafe leather case for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5PWGZY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$23.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $59 — a 59 percent discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CUE8yB"&gt;Right now, PayPal is selling a $100 GameStop gift card for &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/gifts/brands/gamestopdecgood"&gt;$90&lt;/a&gt; that you can also use at ThinkGeek, EB Games, Babbage’s, and Planet X stores. It’s a good chance to save a little on a holiday gift or while treating yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OKgxx0"&gt;Amazon’s also offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/epicdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;variety of deals&lt;/a&gt; on gift cards, like this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vudu-Gift-Cards-Email-Delivery/dp/B09J7SKH8N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 Vudu card for $40&lt;/a&gt; when you use the code &lt;strong&gt;VUDU&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="o4qnWv"&gt;Costco members can get one of Microsoft’s latest Xbox wireless controllers in white &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-wireless-controller-robot-white.product.100735150.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $30&lt;/a&gt; (normally around $55).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="4VjdQW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rThZTp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 8th, 11:45AM PT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;An earlier version of this story claimed that the Amazon Smart Air Thermostat was “built in collaboration with Honeywell Home.” It was not. It was instead built in collaboration with Resideo, the makers of Honeywell Home Thermostat Technology. We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlP4ir"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZN9Jk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic v. Apple ruling put on hold after appeals court grants a stay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhhnGIA6YVp8MxJFlWN2Y26V12M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70245982/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jIgGu"&gt;An appeals court has paused one of the most consequential parts of the Epic v. Apple ruling, &lt;a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21150555/order.pdf"&gt;placing a stay&lt;/a&gt; on the enforcement of the injunction issued by the lower court. As a result of the stay, Apple can maintain its IAP system as the sole source of in-app payments on iOS, despite the district court’s earlier ruling that the exclusive arrangement is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1Em08"&gt;The stay, issued Wednesday afternoon, does not reverse the earlier ruling but puts enforcement on hold until the appeals court can fully hear the case, a process that will likely take months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOvKZr"&gt;“Apple has demonstrated, at minimum, that its appeal raises serious questions on the merits of the district court’s determination,” the ruling reads. “Therefore, we grant Apple’s motion to stay part (i) of paragraph (1) of the permanent injunction. The stay will remain in effect until the mandate issues in this appeal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sW5xO"&gt;“Our concern is that these changes would have created new privacy and security risks, and disrupted the user experience customers love about the App Store,” said Apple spokesperson Marni Goldberg in a statement. “We want to thank the court for granting this stay while the appeals process continues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JU4TLH"&gt;Notably, the stay does not extend to the second part of the injunction, which dealt with user communications outside iOS. Specifically, the court ordered Apple to allow “communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.” That order will remain unaffected by the stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZrVrh"&gt;Apple will also remain bound by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;its agreement with the Japan Fair Steering Commission&lt;/a&gt;, which placed similar anti-steering restrictions on iOS outside the context of the Epic case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOST0D"&gt;In September, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers required Apple to allow third-party payment systems on iOS apps as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;a broader ruling that dismissed antitrust allegations&lt;/a&gt; brought by Fortnite developer Epic Games. Specifically, the court ruled that beginning December 9th, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;could no longer prohibit “buttons or external links”&lt;/a&gt; that direct users to payment systems outside the App Store, as the company previously had in its app store guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HJUzU"&gt;Epic Games declined to comment when reached by &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqRNki"&gt;Apple had previously moved for an injunction from the district court to pause its order but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;was denied&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Hyatt begin rolling out hotel keys in Apple Wallet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aZJlWeDJdvLeptcVsB_PQp7yiNY=/0x0:5100x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70245866/apple_hyatt_hotel_keys.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Using a hotel key stored in Apple Wallet | Photo by Hyatt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="schzpU"&gt;Apple is partnering with Hyatt to give some hotel guests the ability to store their room keys in their Apple Wallets, as announced in a post on &lt;a href="https://newsroom.hyatt.com/news-releases?item=124174#assets_all"&gt;Hyatt’s newsroom&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of checking your pockets for your room key, you’ll now be able to use your iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock your room, as well as any other areas around the hotel that require a key for entry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jkVOqsVC9lD_s-1TszF6Tr5FLyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073568/hyatt_apple_watch_unlock.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Hyatt&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Apple Watch can unlock your hotel room at participating Hyatt hotels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zUQSog"&gt;There are currently only six Hyatt hotels in the US that support this feature, although Hyatt says it plans to eventually include it in hotels worldwide. But for now, the participating hotels include: Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, Hyatt Centric Key West Resort and Spa, Hyatt House Chicago / West Loop-Fulton Market, Hyatt House Dallas / Richardson, Hyatt Place Fremont / Silicon Valley, and Hyatt Regency Long Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5faq1"&gt;Just keep in mind that in order to use the feature, your iPhone will need iOS 15 or above, and your Apple Watch must run watchOS 8 and above. Hyatt notes that once you’ve completed your reservation, you can add your room key to your Apple Wallet through the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/world-of-hyatt/id476639005"&gt;World of Hyatt&lt;/a&gt; app. The key will display your room number and will only activate when your room is ready for check-in. If you need to make any changes to your room, you can do so through the app, and your key will be updated automatically. Your key will deactivate once you’ve checked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kpfb4U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Apple previewed this feature&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC 2021 alongside its digital ID feature. Once launched, this will allow users in participating states to digitally store their identification cards in their Apple Wallets. Although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652051/apple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15"&gt;Arizona and Georgia&lt;/a&gt; were supposed to be the first states to let residents store their IDs on their iPhones, its rollout &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799338/apple-digital-driver-license-delay-2022-ios-15"&gt;has been delayed until 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s voice plan likely to launch with iOS 15.2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GNM4mGiERzIJaVPPRhhEgO1jao=/49x0:1669x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240840/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_10.44.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Music’s new voice plan will cost $4.99 per month.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gzo4X7"&gt;Apple seems to be close to rolling out the Apple Music Voice Plan, a more affordable tier of Apple Music that lets you access music using only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;your voice and the company’s Siri assistant&lt;/a&gt;. The new plan appeared in the update notes for the iOS 15.2 release candidate, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1468280991244603393"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Federico Viticci&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests it will be available widely sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wtLfUq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's iOS 15.2 RC time! Apple also confirmed Apple Music Voice Plan will launch with iOS 15.2 &lt;a href="https://t.co/6uHeaTdr41"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6uHeaTdr41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1468280991244603393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qzljln"&gt;Apple first announced the Voice Plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max"&gt;at its October event&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time, said the new tier would be available in seventeen countries and regions “later this fall.” It will cost $4.99 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mxe72n"&gt;Other iOS 15.2 betas have included a few new features that will likely also be included in the final release. One is the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;set a Legacy Contact&lt;/a&gt; who can access your iCloud data when you die. Another is the Communication Safety feature that blurs nude images &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;for children using the Messages app&lt;/a&gt;, though unlike the version announced earlier this year, parents will not be able to be notified if a child views an image. iPhone 13 Pro users will be able to press a button &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;to turn macro mode on or off&lt;/a&gt;. And promised changes to make iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements easier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786274/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes"&gt;have appeared in iOS 15.2 betas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhaLar"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment about the release date for iOS 15.2 or the Apple Music Voice Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3avx8K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0FGsW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer made a $60 RGB cooling fan with MagSafe for your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ksPr8klWvsl6hkeKkUprWCzacuI=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240061/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_h7e_h83_9276684894238_211207_Phone_Cooler_Chroma_MagSafe_Compatible_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2r578u"&gt;Razer has announced its latest smartphone accessory: &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-accessories%2Frazer-phone-cooler-chroma&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Razer Phone Cooler Chroma&lt;/a&gt;, an RGB-light infused cooling fan for your iPhone or Android device that’s designed to help cool down your phone during intense gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeTtcV"&gt;The Cooler Chroma fan &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-accessories%2Frazer-phone-cooler-chroma%2FRC21-01790100-R3M1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comes in two versions&lt;/a&gt;, both of which cost $59.99: a magnetic model that’s compatible with Apple’s MagSafe accessory system that snaps right onto the back of your iPhone, and a model with a “universal clamp” for Android devices or iPhones without MagSafe. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFBbEOQ51D-ev0AiVj0ct1kVGOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070214/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_11.38.54_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IB7Fiq"&gt;Despite its mobile-focused design, the Cooler Chroma fan doesn’t seem to have a built-in battery, meaning that you’ll need to plug it into a USB-C power source when you want to use it (which will likely limit how useful it’ll actually be for gaming on the go). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ6I4D"&gt;As for the actual cooling properties of the Cooler Chroma, Razer notes that it features a seven-blade fan that spins at up to 6400 RPM, a thermoelectric cooler, and an aluminum heat sink to siphon off excess heat from your phone. There are also 12 customizable RGB lights, of course, because it’s a gaming accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEJHya"&gt;The Razer Phone Cooler Chroma is available now from Razer’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Echo devices still available for Black Friday Prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Echo Show (second generation)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dk0UFqYauf6s7hpqR5vgPxlN3lo=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239553/Echo_Show__Entertainment.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Echo Show devices are still available for their lowest prices ever. | Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KAh4dg"&gt;Black Friday has come and gone, but many awesome deals are still sticking around. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J8FFJ8H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vIoa0cLs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are still offering the second-gen Echo Show 5 for $44.99, the lowest price we’ve seen for this smart device. And while not quite the same price we saw on Cyber Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-8-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Echo Show 8 is also available for a sizeable $40 discount&lt;/a&gt;, taking the price of this smart screen down to just $94.99. Both of these second-generation smart displays are similar in form and function, with the Echo Show 8 featuring a slightly larger screen and a more powerful, 13MP camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJoABq"&gt;Dan Seifert reviewed both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Show 8&lt;/a&gt; for us when they launched this past summer. He concluded that the Echo Show 5 remains a solid option, even though the iterative updates weren’t that impressive. However, he concluded that the second-gen Echo Show 8 remains the best Alexa smart display, despite spotty video calling software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CGjFPc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873822"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While not quite the same deal we saw on Black Friday, $100 off for a machine of this caliber is nothing to scoff at. This 13-inch laptop features 8GB of RAM and a 256GB storage capacity, but the 512GB version is also available for $1,100, taking $150 off the regular price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, Dieter Bohn mentioned the excellent battery life and performance of this keystone piece of Apple hardware, even though its webcam left something to be desired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dvlEvr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cxLRKn"&gt;The Beats Studio 3 are still available for their lowest price at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9oXmObe6Y" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Currently $169.99, this sale takes almost $200 off the original MSRP&lt;/a&gt;. This price is only available for the black and grey colorways, but considering black goes with everything, this shouldn’t be a huge issue. These collapsible, over-ear headphones are designed with Apple users in mind, featuring an Apple W1 chip for seamless Bluetooth connectivity and power efficiency. Rechargeable over micro-USB, the Studio 3 can last up to 22 hours on a single charge and feature built-in noise cancellation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CKa1fP"&gt;The Logitech G502 Lightspeed is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L4BM851?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739789224930594992" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, matching its all-time low price of $99.99. This massive mouse hit this price originally at the beginning of November and fluctuated for a while but is resting comfortably at its lowest price ever. This iteration of the G502 comes equipped with the 25k DPI Hero sensor, six programmable buttons, inserts for adjustable weight, and is compatible with Logitech’s wireless charging Powerplay system. The G502 sports solid battery life on its own, capable of lasting up to 60 hours on a single charge. But, if you invest in the Powerplay mouse pad, you can keep the G502 topped off indefinitely without ever having to worry about battery life again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GoiiLD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Down to just $145.99, this price takes $54 off the regular MSRP and is a remarkable value for this versatile, full-sized keyboard. The K95 Platinum was Corsair’s flagship model until the release of the K100 but remains an amazing entry in this line of gaming Keyboards. Equipped with Cherry MX Silver switches, dedicated macro and media playback keys, the K95 is still one of Corsair’s best keyboards to date. The XT built on the original legacy of the K95 by adding PBT keycaps that resist wear and add a slightly textured finish. Overall, this is an excellent gaming keyboard to have in your armory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gJ4oTm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li id="NZ5QBz"&gt;If you’re looking to build out your &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; collection, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9sBIyK5RV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently, if you buy three Magic boosters or starter kits, you can get a fourth one free at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $850.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including ones equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult. It’s a slightly different story for the newer M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros, but any bit of savings you can get on the hit new Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;recently released macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; — but we strongly recommend opting for a newer model now that Apple has introduced its M1 chips across the MacBook Air and Pro lines. There is really no downside to opting for Apple’s own silicon, save for Windows Boot Camp holdouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac%2F2020-mac-mini-macbook-air-macbook-pro&amp;amp;subid1=vergemacbookdealsdecember2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999; however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9uVs7jC5c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $899.99. The $1,249 512GB configuration is also on sale in all colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9u0JFONVF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,099.99. These deals can come and go quickly, though, and if you’re gift shopping, you have to keep in mind a retailer’s cut-off date for arriving in time for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xStRiT"&gt;The MacBook Pro line has been split into two different segments — for the time being. The M1-powered MacBook Pro of 2020 remains the final Touch Bar holdout. It is a sibling to the MacBook Air, introduced at the same time, with similar innards — save mostly for a fan that allows it to run at peak performance for longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2iOUM"&gt;The new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, are all new and come with the M1 Pro or optional M1 Max CPUs. There are multiple variants of both models, though we haven’t seen any noteworthy discounts on any configuration outside of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQSLL92?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s current discount of around $78 on the base 14-inch model&lt;/a&gt;. Though now that we’re in the heart of the holiday season, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KS0G3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"2021 MacBook Pros compared: how Apple’s laptops stack up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733406/macbook-pro-13-14-16-inch-m1-max-air-compare-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="h4rH4i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the latest MacBook Pro line were absolutely beaming with praise. Whether it was the beautiful display or the remarkable performance and battery life they exhibited, these premium laptops are investments that we can wholeheartedly recommend. As soon as there’s a price break on these impressive laptops, we’d suggest that anyone in the market for a new laptop consider purchasing one, as they’re likely to move fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDERSc"&gt;Right now, the only deal on the new crop of MacBook Pros is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQSLL92?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s price of $1,920.72 for the 14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; with M1 Pro CPU. That’s a discount of $78.44 for the base model with M1 Pro processor, 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oXGxIx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AOJENT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The Touch Bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the Air but geared toward slightly more demanding use cases. The M1-powered base model includes 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model is on sale for $100 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LLDSG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604809-REG%2Fapple_myd82ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,199. The larger, 512GB configuration is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $1,249.99 at checkout, one of its best prices to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $569.99 at checkout&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $749.99 at checkout&lt;/a&gt;. Costco members can also purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-512gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694240.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB models for the same price&lt;/a&gt;, though no other retailers are offering this same discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is down to $100 at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z9eZCOFbtVB7q5QMXCDPVzr-Rj0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235583/dbohn_201109_4283_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Duo can charge a Qi-equipped iPhone alongside an Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Kfo3E"&gt;Another week, another round of deals worthy of your consideration to save your hard-earned money. Last week, we saw Apple’s MagSafe Battery pack fall to a new all-time low, and now its premium dual-wireless charger is following suit, with more deals in tow if you read on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKVuVq"&gt;While the iPhone’s MagSafe charging ecosystem &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;remains a bit of a mess&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been with us long enough to see sizable discounts hitting its upper crust of accessories. The MagSafe Duo charger may not be everyone’s favorite — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, we flagged some quibbles we had with its design and asking price — but it remains one of the fastest ways to wirelessly charge an iPhone and Apple Watch from a single source. It also folds up for easy travel and storage. At a new low price of $100 ($29 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nEXnt5Mz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, it’s definitely worth considering. Just be sure to budget for a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C power adapter&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t already have one, as the MagSafe Duo does not include it and you’ll need at least a 20W model to fast-charge your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RVSQM7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oRocMb"&gt;On the topic of tech we can appreciate a little more once the price drops, the Fitbit Charge 5 is still $50 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nl8R6oaf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BXQ4HMB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The Charge 5 is the latest model of Fitbit’s popular line of fitness trackers, however, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Jay Peters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;felt that the wearable’s reliance on a touchscreen really hampered the experience&lt;/a&gt;. The shortcomings of the Charge 5 are easier to overlook now that it costs 28 percent less, especially since it packs a bright, color screen and stress management features. The $130 price point matches the Charge 5 price we saw on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so you are getting the best price around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JwJ89n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fitbit is rolling out an ECG app to the Charge 5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22765408/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-electrocardiogram-app-daily-readiness-score"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="RwOBpw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905023"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DyUvyC"&gt;Shifting over to a different kind of wearable, one that’s also helpful for your fitness routine, the Bose Sport Open earbuds are $30 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VRLZGMF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nDQEkc7Z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. These are some unique earbuds from Bose, offering an open design that helps keep you aware of what’s around you. Our own Dieter Bohn tested these Bose, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22330833/open-ear-headphones-review-best-bike-riding" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;alongside several other open-design listening options&lt;/a&gt;, and found them to have very good sound quality, though they may not be ideal if you wear eyeglasses while you run or bike, as the earbuds’ hook may get in the way. Still, for just $169, you can have great sound while maintaining a high level of situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wv7h2D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905045"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLjDFE"&gt;If you’re in the market for a future-proof tablet, the current discount on the 11-inch iPad Pro with the M1 processor and 512GB of storage offers a lot of headroom for an excellent value. This configuration of iPad Pro can be had from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0931YYPNN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $979&lt;/a&gt;, a discount of $120. The M1 chip ensures that this iPad Pro will stay quick and snappy years into the future, and with four times the amount of storage as the base model, you can be a little less reliant on iCloud and other cloud-based storage solutions. The iPad Pro also sports Apple’s new Center Stage feature, which allows the front-facing camera to automatically track you during video calls. Just add a keyboard and you have yourself a serviceable laptop alternative. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nlRX0x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brydge’s 11-inch Max Plus iPad keyboard is now available","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759698/brydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="SXHsJw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905041"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ndq1JX"&gt;Some more deals on tech, accessories, and gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0vVmvx"&gt;Twelve months of Xbox Live Gold is just &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal120621&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmicrosoft-12-months%2Fp%2FN82E16832011522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 at Newegg&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;SSAZZ624&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be a cost-effective way to get into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, if you’re not already subscribed. Add it to your account, buy one month of Game Pass, and the 12 months of Xbox Live will be converted. If you already have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, this can extend your membership by an additional four months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nD8nEH"&gt;Apple’s official Leather Case with MagSafe for the iPhone 12 Mini is just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5PWGZY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24 in black at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, instead of the usual $59. That is a great value if you have the diminutive-sized iPhone from last year and want some premium leather without the premium cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NAt4eI"&gt;The Acer Nitro XF273 IPS 1080p monitor is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nZrJOpoF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$210 ($90 off) at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now. It may not be the highest resolution for a monitor of this size, but the 27-inch display offers a fast response rate and up to 165Hz refresh for a low cost. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2ap1uk"&gt;The Beats Flex are $20 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nHQVA7QG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them down to $50. Sadly, this used to be the full price of the Flex earbuds, before Apple increased the price to $70 in September. That said, they are still very worthwhile neckbuds at $50. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VEdc1H"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XY86472?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XY8H9D5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt; versions of the 8BitDo Pro 2 Bluetooth controller for the Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XY8H9D5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$5 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; when you clip the coupon. That brings this excellent controller down to $45, matching its historical low price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7i3YJT"&gt;Apple’s base model Mac Mini with the M1 processor is down to just &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$570 at Costco&lt;/a&gt;. This member-exclusive price is on the 256GB model, the cheapest option for the tiny Mac that punches well above its weight class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
