    <title>The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Complete with software features that make it easy to join parties, record, and share video clips&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mbWWFf"&gt;As the high-profile disputes about what content you can play on your iPhone rage on between Apple, Epic Games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;Google, and Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, a company called Backbone is focusing instead on making sure you get the most out of the games that are currently available. Like Razer did with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431952/razer-kishi-controller-iphone-ios-review"&gt;Kishi controller for iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and as other companies have with snap-on controllers of their own, Backbone is introducing one for $100 that it calls the Backbone One. You can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone-one%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21525741%2Fbackbones-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy it from Backbone’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JltN1G"&gt;With the controller fully extended, it can fit any iPhone running iOS 13 or later, starting with the iPhone 6S and including the new iPhone 12 lineup. It’s great for Apple Arcade games that support controllers. &lt;em&gt;Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; play wonderfully with the One. And, for popular games like &lt;em&gt;COD: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; that don’t have controller support switched on from the start, Backbone curates visual tutorials that appear before it launches to walk you through the steps to turn it on in the game’s settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj5Dex"&gt;Since the Backbone One launched, it now works with &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;the xCloud iOS beta&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22176273/google-stadia-ios-beta-live-now-mobile-safari-iphone-ipad-cloud-gaming"&gt;Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Even playing games like &lt;em&gt;Hades &lt;/em&gt;through the Steam Link app (with my PC connected via Wi-Fi) felt surprisingly natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1n-iRgtg4cNfJG9iV9Qy9fsR30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989942/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The analog stick is sized similarly to the ones built into the Joy-Con for Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwtkqN-w96Qpe_ZU3kc0i5S13g4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989940/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The triggers are also similar to those on the Joy-Con, yet these have a more satisfying travel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RBU5X5"&gt;Unlike most controller accessories made thus far, the Backbone One is a hybrid of tightly integrated hardware and software. If we’re looking at the hardware, it’s arguably the best of its kind yet. Both sides of this controller have rounded edges that fit naturally in my hand. I praised the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;design of the Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;, but this has a more subtle look that doesn’t cover up as much of your phone’s edges. Each button has a more responsive, tactile click, and the analog sticks feel roughly the same size as Nintendo’s Joy-Con for the Switch. Speaking of the Joy-Con, the One’s rear triggers actually feel &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="58jOQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9545130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dT19br"&gt;The Backbone One features passthrough Lightning charging, with support for Lightning headphones if you have a set. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack, giving you another way to listen to audio — even if your iPhone doesn’t have the port itself. As for power consumption, Backbone says the One itself demands less power from your iPhone than many wired Lightning earbuds do. I didn’t notice more battery usage during gameplay with the controller attached than I normally would without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4p9F_Zg3IM1_Vae-Y_dIeslxJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989938/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0008.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miraculously, the One adds a 3.5mm port, so bust out those wired headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RfRkKTciPYMa4kacwguTUQNRdnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989939/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0007.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lightning port supports passthrough charging, as well as audio for Lightning EarPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l1gqUO"&gt;The hardware alone might make it worth the purchase, but the software is what really makes it unique. The One doesn’t require its companion app to work with any iOS game that supports a controller, but using the app turns your iPhone into a game console of sorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jz4iFB"&gt;Pushing the controller’s orange Backbone button while the One is connected to your phone will open up the Backbone app, which looks like an operating system. There, you’ll find all of your installed games cleanly laid out in an almost tvOS-esque interface. The app also shows new games available for download in the App Store that support controllers. To add games to the Backbone interface, just tap the orange button when you first boot up each new game. This app takes advantage of the iPhone’s excellent haptics to buzz when you flip around the menu, and the company made its own satisfyingly subtle vibration effect that you’ll feel while quickly flying through a bunch of tiles in the interface with the L1 and R1 shoulder buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-efuXwQzJPeyAGX1M8hsh_zbU_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989937/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A full look at what you’ll see when you press the orange Backbone button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ru0rOB"&gt;Scroll down a little more in the app, and you’ll find photo and video clips you’ve saved and those from friends. This controller has a dedicated button to let you snap a screenshot in-game, or even record a video clip, which are features that should be familiar to anyone who’s used a modern gaming console. Notably here, though, is that you can press and hold that button for a moment to bookmark key moments on the fly. The Backbone button illuminates a red LED while you’re recording, so it’s easy to see at a glance when you’re live. Backbone handles recording and accessing clips much more elegantly than the Xbox One, PS4, PC, or Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmj6IX"&gt;After a video clip is saved, you can then trim and share the clip in the Backbone app, as well as via iMessage or any social media apps you use. One special thing to note is that Backbone says it can record 1080p clips at 30 frames per second in the HEVC / H.265 codec (supported on the iPhone 7 and newer), so you’ll have higher-quality video without sacrificing as much storage space as other codecs require. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDEF3SLBaPKkIkl_SrS9MuVoyhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989936/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0011.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Backbone button pulses red to indicate when you’re recording the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oSMZng"&gt;Yet another software feature you’ll get with the controller is the ability to create parties and voice chat with friends in the app. These parties operate independently of the game you’re each playing (you don’t even need to be playing a game), so it’s a good way to connect even if you aren’t all into &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, for example. If you’re into recording clips with your friends, the video recording feature will pick up your voice in the mix, along with everyone else’s in the party (indicated by the small orange light near the iPhone’s top bezel in iOS 14). Each participant can choose to mute their mic by double-pressing the left-most button that has three horizontal dots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgmECWkKc--QQXEotbQMAmPsNHI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989935/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0012.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can start or join a party to voice chat through the Backbone app with other users for free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CHeiZ4"&gt;Snapshots, video recording, and organizing parties for voice chat are just a few ways in which Backbone takes the reins in iOS to create a more interesting experience than Apple itself offers to gamers. It also offers rich presence notifications, chiming in with a notification — whether you’re in the Backbone app or not — to tell you when a friend has logged on, or with an invite that you can click to join a party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxoO9S"&gt;On its face, the Backbone One is just a controller — and a very good one, at that. But with software enhancements that take advantage of iOS in some clever ways, Backbone makes the iPhone feel like a bona fide gaming platform that I want to remain a part of. When the hardware and software are all working together, with the ability to easily join up with friends and record clips, the One feels like a gaming experience that somehow beats Apple to the punch of fleshing out its own gaming ambitions. It is no longer just like a phone strapped into a few pieces of plastic but the start of something very special. And for $100, without monthly charges to use its software and party tools, it’s an appealing price if you do a lot of mobile gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IEqzM-niSipNq1wH_IfrUwzzutc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989945/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Backbone One controller supports all the way back to the iPhone 6S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bFdquo"&gt;As well as it works on iOS, the Backbone One seems perhaps better suited to launch on Android, given that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t available on Apple’s App Store. Though, since the One launched, Google Stadia and Microsoft’s xCloud game streaming services have come to iOS, giving you more content to play than before. Backbone wouldn’t comment when I asked about an Android-specific version of the One. But this iOS controller is already worth the cost of admission if you’re an Apple Arcade subscriber or just enjoy a few one-off games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIGiuB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHPQc6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Backbone confirmed that &lt;/em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;em&gt; is supported by the One. Also, I’ve updated this review to note that Google Stadia and xCloud are both accessible on iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_G4X8M_S6lSPjjJ01aHa2-DOPBw=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192532/app_tracking_transparency.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YSB2td"&gt;Apple’s latest iPhone update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, brings a host of new features that customers will likely see and enjoy — better Face ID unlocking when wearing a mask (for Apple Watch users only), new emoji, support for PS5 and Xbox Series X controllers, and more. But the new update also adds a much more important and  controversial new feature: App Tracking Transparency. That’s Apple’s name for a privacy feature that’s shaping up to be the company’s next big fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nivnR1"&gt;The change has been a contentious one. Apple originally announced the feature alongside the rest of iOS 14 last June &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;but has delayed the release until now&lt;/a&gt; to give developers more time to adapt to the changes. It’s finally live, though, setting the stage for what could be a massive fight between the Cupertino tech giant and competitors like Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EygHYi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ddAD0r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did ad tracking work on iOS before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHQP3A"&gt;Before iOS 14.5, developers could use a host of tools to track user data from within an app. Advertisers could then use it in conjunction with similar data from around the rest of the web to broadly identify information about a user and use that profile to better target them with advertisements (and sell those advertisement opportunities to other companies and businesses that want to focus on their specific marketing segments). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDglwp"&gt;The main tool that’s been available to developers until now has been an Apple-controlled system that’s been around for almost a decade, Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), but developers could also use other third-party tools and methods to cobble together user data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8konp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does App Tracking Transparency change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFboTG"&gt;Technically, App Tracking Transparency alone doesn’t make any seismic changes to how iOS handles ad tracking. Users have been able to opt out of IDFA-based tracking before, but the new update puts the choice front and center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cA4LSg"&gt;It forces developers to give users a choice: once updated to iOS 14.5, every single company that wants to track users and their data across different apps and websites now have to ask permission first using a standardized prompt created by Apple, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rry80Qr7Mx3BYeP6skQNsVKCPmI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472867/Untitled.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vMoguF"&gt;If users say that they’re cool with being tracked (by clicking the “Allow” button) everything works just like it did before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQSOr0"&gt;If they click “Ask app not to track,” though, then that developer can’t track customers using their data in that app, or sell that data to other companies. Not with Apple’s IDFA system, and not with their own systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZzoxT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any exceptions or alternatives? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOPxXN"&gt;There are a few exceptions to Apple’s new app tracking rules. First, companies that own multiple apps can track users across those different apps — for example, Facebook can use data it gathers from Instagram to target ads in its main app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz4j61"&gt;And Apple is offering new, in-house tools for developers to use instead. One tool, SKAdNetwork, can tell a company how many times its app was installed after an ad was seen. Another, Private Click Measurement, can tell them how many times users clicked on an ad for a product within an app. Apple says that both of those methods are designed to prevent companies from getting information about a specific user, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkeMqz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are people annoyed about this? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ijBDL"&gt;App Tracking Transparency has been praised by groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small"&gt;which called the concept&lt;/a&gt; of making companies ask before they track users on the internet an “obvious baseline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0cwxe"&gt;But not everyone likes the system, and the strongest objections to App Tracking Transparency have been from Facebook. It says Apple’s new system will make it harder and more expensive for ad networks to easily target customers, which in turn will hurt small businesses that rely on highly targeted ad campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5HLD0"&gt;Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;taken out full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; contesting the changes and argued that Apple’s changes could also hurt websites that rely on lucrative targeted ads to make ends meet, forcing them to subscription services or paywalls for content that used to be free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqDODr"&gt;While Facebook’s main arguments appear altruistic, it’s also important to note that Facebook itself stands to lose out here. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Ffacebook-looks-to-take-its-fight-with-apple-to-court%3Firclickid%3D3NsQiH1XqxyLTgawUx0Mo38dUkB0YO0p3xAMRo0%26irgwc%3D1%26utm_source%3Daffiliate%26utm_medium%3Dcpa%26utm_campaign%3D10078-Skimbit%2BLtd.%26utm_term%3Dtheverge.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F27%2F22405474%2Fapple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;, the kinds of ads that Apple’s new rule impacts aren’t a huge part of Facebook’s business model — less than 5 percent of Facebook’s $84 billion annual ad revenue — but it’s still a noticeable chunk of change, especially considering that Facebook’s internal estimates reportedly expect around 80 percent of iOS users to opt out. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwQxjzz2i6KUlQ00H5M-q9f8O4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472878/Untitled_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qabc7d"&gt;Apple is also giving companies a chance to make their case for allowing ad tracking. Developers will have control over &lt;em&gt;when &lt;/em&gt;to show Apple’s prompt, specifically to give apps like Facebook, NBC News, or BBC a chance to make their case to users about why they should allow tracking. And Facebook is doing just that, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;letter to users&lt;/a&gt; that tries to sell them on the idea of getting more relevant advertisements and supporting small businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCw19r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can companies just track me anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfLYzE"&gt;Apple’s prompt disables its own IFDA system on a system level, so if users turn down apps, developers can’t access it. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/"&gt;Apple says that companies&lt;/a&gt; are also “required to respect your choice beyond the advertising identifier” when it comes to other means of tracking user data, and companies that do try to sneak around the rules could be subject to the same consequences as any other developer violating App Store terms of service, up to and including having their app removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVgODg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about Apple’s apps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwQjMA"&gt;Apple says that its apps will abide by the new rules, too — as a matter of policy, the company claims that its first-party apps already don’t track users across other apps and websites, which is why you won’t see it appear on Apple’s apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsLNuh"&gt;That said, Apple &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; still have some tracking that it uses to serve personalized ads within the App Store, Stocks, and Apple News apps. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223"&gt;As detailed here&lt;/a&gt;, Apple uses information like location, keyboard language settings, device type, OS version, mobile carrier, and more to serve customers more relevant ads within its apps. It also uses account information and past purchases to lump customers into market segments to better target ads within those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svZ1Pm"&gt;The difference is that Apple only uses that information within its own apps, doesn’t link it to additional profiles from third-party sources, and doesn’t sell that data. Apple also has an &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074"&gt;additional toggle&lt;/a&gt;, located in “Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Apple Advertising,” to disable that tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l9VcBN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there antitrust concerns?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnhA1Q"&gt;It’s a major tech story in 2021; of course there are antitrust concerns. A group of German advertisers have &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a48d9aa-244b-4945-b2a0-01c68683544a"&gt;already filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; about the new system, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-scores-legal-win-in-france-over-app-privacy-changes-11615971737"&gt;French regulators&lt;/a&gt; shot down an initial antitrust complaint in March, noting that the system “doesn’t appear to be abusive” on Apple’s part.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjahJE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will I be spammed by these toggles forever? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZX2mQ"&gt;Nope. Apps can only request once, when you first open them after the update. Developers who don’t want to track you don’t have to show the prompt at all. There’s also a global setting switch that lets users just opt out of all apps by default in Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking, and toggling off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” That menu also allows users to grant (or revoke) permission from apps after the initial prompt has been shown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsBf0X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TOuZV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will reportedly face EU antitrust charges this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4GwVxJLGZYoi4O8bBiGe2akZVk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191330/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pqoXp2"&gt;The European Commission will issue antitrust charges against Apple over concerns about the company’s App Store practices, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df07e3f2-2d6e-4ced-a819-779e743d85ff"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The commission has been investigating whether Apple has broken EU competition rules with its App Store policies, following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;initial complaint from Spotify&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019 over Apple’s 30 percent cut on subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCD0Ib"&gt;The European Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;opened up two antitrust investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s App Store and Apple Pay practices last year, and the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; only mentions upcoming charges on the App Store case. It’s not clear yet what action will be taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOPots"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18530894/apple-music-monopoly-spotify-app-store-europe"&gt;Spotify has previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; Apple uses its App Store to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice in favor of its own Apple Music service. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292625/apple-rakuten-kobo-app-store-antitrust-complaint-europe"&gt;Rakuten filed a similar complaint&lt;/a&gt; to the EU last year, alleging that it’s anti-competitive for Apple to take a 30 percent commission on ebooks sold through the App Store while promoting its own Apple Books service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcTxKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s all about the Apple tax&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XZSIfm"&gt;Known as the “Apple tax,” this 30 percent cut has long been targeted by companies like Netflix and Spotify. Apple has defended its policies, arguing that the revenue it earns contributes toward the costs of maintaining the App Store and enforcing its content, privacy, and security guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKWX5p"&gt;Epic Games also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286998/epic-games-apple-european-comission-antitrust-complaint-app-store-fortnite"&gt;filed an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the EU earlier this year, as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know/archives"&gt;ongoing dispute with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer has publicly criticized Apple’s App Store policies around distribution and payments, resulting in Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;attempting to circumvent&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Apple quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed the game from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;, and a legal battle is now in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTHG8Z"&gt;Despite Apple’s defense of its App Store, the iPhone-maker has already sought to ease pressure from regulators and developers with App Store policy changes over the past year. Apple now lets some video streaming apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;bypass the App Store cut&lt;/a&gt;, and it has reduced its App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;commission rate to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for any developer that earns less than $1 million in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiDk0I"&gt;These changes alone haven’t been enough to ease the fears of EU regulators if the report from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; is accurate, and we’ll now find out later this week exactly how the European Union will respond to one of the United States’ biggest tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will now let you add virtual lasers and confetti to your Clips videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qG4D6EjruHqvOrizIqrZQ0klOjA=/0x181:1306x1052/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189589/Apple_clips_adds_immersive_new_ar_spaces_iphone12pro_042621_inline.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0bKlTv"&gt;Apple now lets you add augmented-reality lasers, confetti, and more to your Clips videos, thanks to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fclips-adds-immersive-new-arspaces%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22404413%2Fapple-ar-lidar-clips-video-effects-sparkle-lasers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an update to the short-form video app&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, called AR Spaces, will let users with LIDAR-equipped Apple devices (so far, that’s the iPhone 12 Pros and iPad Pros from 2020 or later) add room-filling effects that can interact with walls and floors. (If you watched Apple’s April 20th event, you may have spotted &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M?t=2697"&gt;a brief look at the update&lt;/a&gt; ahead of today’s release.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7C22qp"&gt;You can get an idea of what this will look like in action with this GIF taken from Apple’s demo video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wy6r-Dc-R5X2JAdmGgL-9cg-pCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471539/apple_clips_ar.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prism and Dance Floor effects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOP8L0"&gt;Apple says that the AR Spaces effects should work with the other effects built in to Clips, such as the animated stickers and emoji, if you want to add even more to your videos. The update to the app can be downloaded now from the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK2MkR"&gt;The Clips update is Apple’s latest experiment with AR, in which the company has a keen interest. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22278780/apple-augmented-reality-ar-app-for-all-mankind-tv-plus"&gt;released an AR experience tie-in&lt;/a&gt; for its show &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind &lt;/em&gt;in February, and CEO Tim Cook discussed some of his thoughts about AR tech in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;an interview earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. There are also rumors that Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;working on a full-fledged AR / VR headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change Siri’s voice in iOS 14.5 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFsYk_I7SRkTLJ2YqLOOcBYLeUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067730/akrales_190522_3444_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvbuiG"&gt;Until recently, the default voice for Apple’s Siri assistant has been stereotypically female-sounding. However, studies have found that having AI assistants default to female-sounding voices can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634322/amazon-alexa-apple-siri-female-voice-assistants-harmful-gender-stereotypes-new-study"&gt;reinforce harmful stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple has tried to fix that in its upcoming iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KGYdg"&gt;Starting with iOS 14.5, when you get a new phone, you’ll be prompted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;pick a default voice for Siri&lt;/a&gt; — and Apple is including two new voice options. But if you’ve updated your current phone to 14.5, you don’t have to wait. This guide will show you how to change the voice after setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhB1LI"&gt;It’s a reasonably simple process. First, go to the Settings app, then to Siri &amp;amp; Search, and tap Siri Voice. There, you’ll be presented with the list of options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/583JirAdCoNcghR8xipu6St_0-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416486/Image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap Siri Voice to be taken to the list of options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mph8AS"&gt;At the moment, the American variety is the only one with four voice choices; Australian, British, Indian, Irish, and South African versions only have two. The four US voice choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yS4oPO"&gt;Voice 1, which is a soft-spoken male-sounding voice &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="swUqtC"&gt;Voice 2, an energetic, confident female-sounding voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6YrCC"&gt;Voice 3 is similar to Voice 2 but male-sounding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OtUBen"&gt;And finally, Voice 4, which is similar to the default Siri voice that’s been around all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tZcBH0"&gt;If you want to hear what the voices sound like for yourself, they’re in the embedded tweet below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ZG9v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Siri's new voice options in the latest iOS 14.5 Beta &lt;a href="https://t.co/25pUA8kP7V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/25pUA8kP7V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1378024607962128384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5h6cp"&gt;Tapping on a voice will play a snippet of it saying “Hi, I’m Siri. Choose the voice you’d like me to use.” If you choose voices 1–3, your phone will have to download them before you can use them, but you don’t have to stay in the Settings app while it does so. Once it’s finished downloading, Siri will respond with your chosen voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlKF9C"&gt;If you’ve just updated to macOS 11.3, you can also select from the new options by going to System Preferences, then Siri. From there, you can choose the voice you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwMin9n3CbGzKfr5iRfznvl8qdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471503/Screen_Shot_2021_04_26_at_1.02.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Siri voices have come to macOS as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>The macOS 11.3 update includes a massive security patch and new emoji</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mKe_exYNCZlsrBguqFyi40pdi8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188772/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q3HA91"&gt;Apple has just released macOS 11.3, alongside iOS 14.5. It’s probably worth updating your Mac to it as soon as you can — not only because it comes with some new features, including improvements for running iPhone and iPad apps on M1 Macs and updates to Apple Music and Podcasts, but it also fixes a major security flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RgAIa"&gt;The update &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-macos-113-patches-security-flaw-vulnerability/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29"&gt;reportedly patches a vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; that allowed malware to bypass many of macOS’s built-in protections, like File Quarantine and GateKeeper’s opening dialog box. While Apple’s built-in anti-malware system could &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/shlayer-mac-malware-macos-security/"&gt;still block malicious programs if Apple were aware of them&lt;/a&gt;, enterprise software company Jamf did find evidence that the security flaw &lt;a href="https://www.jamf.com/blog/shlayer-malware-abusing-gatekeeper-bypass-on-macos/"&gt;was being exploited by attackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sd3MC7"&gt;Apple also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212325"&gt;details a slew of other security fixes&lt;/a&gt; that are included with the latest update on its security update page. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;Catalina and Mojave&lt;/a&gt; have received security patches as well, for those who haven’t yet updated to Big Sur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sqa92"&gt;Aside from security updates, one of the biggest new improvements in 11.3 (at least for owners of M1 Macs) is the ability to resize iPhone and iPad app windows. Apple’s also added keyboard, mouse, and trackpad support for games that are compatible with controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rYZejN98nU34EvibuyHdn9myDrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471373/Screen_Shot_2021_04_26_at_12.18.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The infinity symbol in the queue controls the Autoplay feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="adDieb"&gt;Apple has also added autoplay to the Music app — a feature which is either great or annoying depending on your mood. After you reach the end of a song or playlist, Apple Music will continue playing music that it thinks is similar (thankfully, it can be turned off if you’re just looking to listen to one specific song). The News and Podcasts apps also have redesigned pages to make them easier to use (with the former getting a reworked search feature — something that’s exciting to me, and possibly no one else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHAOre"&gt;The update also adds many of the features that are in iOS 14.5: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;ability to track AirTags&lt;/a&gt; using the Find My app, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;new emoji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;Siri voices&lt;/a&gt;, and support for the Xbox Series X / S and PlayStation 5 DualSense controllers. You can visit Apple’s site to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211896"&gt;see the entire list of updates and features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMdFEphfvF9abukIpdfb71urPwg=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188189/DSCF2033.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BkliOm"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.5 is out, and with it comes the ability to have your Apple Watch unlock your Face ID-protected phone if you happen to be wearing a mask. This will make it a lot easier to get through your day without having to enter your passcode each time you need to use your phone (because the Face ID can’t recognize you with that mask on). As long as your phone and watch are in close proximity, you will be able to unlock your iPhone just by turning on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMLEZg"&gt;Once you’re officially running iOS 14.5 (and watchOS 7.4), it’s easy to enable the feature that lets you unlock your iPhone with your watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n9cWI3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322418"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="huAMks"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Face ID &amp;amp; Passcode, and scroll down to the new Unlock With Apple Watch option. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jJTFRE"&gt;Toggle it on to turn on the feature. (There’s nothing you have to do on the watch.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JPijRY"&gt;Now that you have it installed, here’s what you can expect. First, and most important to note, is that your phone isn’t looking for &lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask, it’s looking for &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask. With this feature on, when my wife was wearing a mask, she was able to unlock my phone with no problem if I was within three or so feet. Apple even warns you about this when you turn the feature on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EpD-gKQYBs0Zk8CSxCmgskqnpas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471051/IMG_1328.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple warns you about the fact that your phone will only be looking for a face with a mask. (Note: “Beagle” is the name of my Apple Watch)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mVPWWS"&gt;Apple’s mitigation to this is whenever your Apple Watch is used to unlock your phone, the watch buzzes you, along with a notification saying your phone has been unlocked and a button to lock it. Pressing that lock button immediately locks your phone and requires a passcode on next unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csLdnt"&gt;With that caveat out of the way, so far I’ve had great success with the feature. I tried it with a variety of masks, and it worked with all of them for me. It is worth noting again that the phone is looking for a face with a mask, so this feature won’t help you if your phone is lying on the table and you try to unlock it — because the Face ID camera can’t see you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fteXGe"&gt;Still, I find that not having to put in my passcode every time I want to check my grocery list while shopping is a huge benefit and worth what I consider to be a relatively minor security trade-off. The feature may not be for those with super-secret info on their phones, but for everyone else it’ll be a nice quality-of-life improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.5 is out now with new Face ID mask features and Apple’s App Tracking Transparency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uxHyIL_pFeBvJfzxv_5DCN6eO0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187801/akrales_201017_4238_0054.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5wYbbJ"&gt;Apple has begun rolling out iOS and iPadOS 14.5. The latest software update includes the new App Tracking Transparency feature, which lets users decide whether to allow apps to track their activity “across other companies’ apps and websites” for advertising purposes. A pop-up will now appear whenever apps are designed to share your activity in this way. Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;heavily criticized&lt;/a&gt; Apple over App Tracking Transparency, claiming that it presents “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;a false tradeoff&lt;/a&gt; between personalized ads and privacy.” The new option could have a detrimental impact on Facebook’s ad business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1cuOw"&gt;Apple made a video to explain App Tracking Transparency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NEfPDq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ihw_Al4RNno?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0iFEZ"&gt;Perhaps more important to day-to-day iPhone usage, iOS 14.5 also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;a very helpful and timely new trick&lt;/a&gt;: if you own an Apple Watch, you can set your iPhone to automatically unlock without requiring a Face ID match or passcode as long as Apple’s smartwatch is on your wrist. This is designed to make getting into your phone that much quicker while we’re all still wearing face masks so frequently throughout the day. Installing watchOS 7.4 is necessary for this feature to work; that update is also available as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kZiE8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JJNXDH"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 14.5 include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;a ton of new emoji&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on inclusivity. The update adds the ability to watch Apple Fitness Plus workouts on a TV with AirPlay 2. Apple’s Podcasts app is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;getting a new design&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price"&gt;optional subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. The latest video game controllers for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S are now supported on the iPhone and iPad as of this update. And all iPhone 12 models will allow for 5G connectivity in dual-SIM mode in more countries. Starting with the 14.5 update, Apple will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;no longer default to a female-sounding voice&lt;/a&gt; for its Siri assistant. Instead, you’ll be prompted to choose your preferred voice during device setup. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fios-14-5-offers-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch-diverse-siri-voices-and-more%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403554%2Fapple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple has a post up&lt;/a&gt; with all of the miscellaneous improvements and additions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl8z9p"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 14.5 is rolling out to iPhone and iPad users now; you can check the “software update” section in settings to begin the update process right away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Currently, the App Tracking Transparency feature seems to be misbehaving for some people; it either doesn’t respond or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the toggle in Tracking is grayed out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We’ve reached out to Apple and will update this as information comes in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDYz4i"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days, and in iOS 14.5, which is starting to roll out to the public today, there are new privacy features that may make you feel happier but are not endearing Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;The new feature is aptly called App Tracking Transparency. Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The new version of iOS allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you won’t have to do anything; you’ll be automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track, and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 9:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a note about problems with the new feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3q8mGj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA5RTE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new $1 billion North Carolina campus and $80 billion additional US spending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BA4XXy5oykpjVDYUdVabyCqF1Qs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186197/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HctfLO"&gt;Apple has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403407%2Fapple-us-spending-new-north-carolina-campus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new spending plans&lt;/a&gt; for the US, including the establishment of a 3,000-employee “campus and engineering hub” in North Carolina and the commitment of an additional $80 billion in investment across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVTPiv"&gt;Back in 2018, the firm said it would spend more than $350 billion in the US over the next five years, but today, it announced it is increasing that figure by 20 percent to $430 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuMnJs"&gt;“At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to US innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBGFeQ"&gt;And why not? Like many big tech firms, Apple has done &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/technology/tech-company-earnings-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html"&gt;very well during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, when other industries have suffered and investors have sought safe places for their money. The company likes to spin these investment announcements as a sort of largesse, but they are, of course, par for the course for a hugely successful and ambitious firm like Apple. As today’s press release notes, the $80 billion will go toward “direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the US, and other domestic spend — including dozens of Apple TV+ productions across 20 states.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tA4QfA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple will invest in basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and broadband&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rn2Ug4"&gt;The new campus in North Carolina is noteworthy and part of an ongoing trend among tech firms to look outside their traditional California homes. Google is currently &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/google-to-invest-1-billion-in-new-campus-in-new-york-city.html"&gt;investing&lt;/a&gt; $1 billion in a New York City campus; Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262149/amazon-helix-arlington-virginia-design-hq2-campus"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; its second HQ in Virginia; and Oracle &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+move+headquarters&amp;amp;oq=oracle+move+headquarters&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2768j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last year it’s moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03fjHs"&gt;Apple’s North Carolina campus will be part of the state’s Research Triangle (named after the trio of nearby universities: Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The company will invest more than $1 billion in the area and pledges to create at least 3,000 new jobs in “machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and other cutting-edge fields.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HlVqX"&gt;Notably, Apple also says it will establish a $100 million fund to support “schools and communities” in North Carolina and will contribute more than $110 million to 80 of the state’s poorest counties to help fund critical infrastructure like “broadband, roads and bridges, and public schools.” The Biden administration has made such infrastructure spending a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/economy/biden-infrastructure-plan.html"&gt;critical part&lt;/a&gt; of its plans for the US, but it seems that when government lags behind, private firms will step in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvD22z"&gt;You can read Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403407%2Fapple-us-spending-new-north-carolina-campus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full press release&lt;/a&gt; for further details, including the companies expanding hiring in its teams in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, and Iowa, and its investments in new clean energy projects in the US and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
