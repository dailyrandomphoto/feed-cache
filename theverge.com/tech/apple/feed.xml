    <title>We’re happy to inform you that Apple’s isn’t requiring verification for education discounts anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50TLf-UapZYpyPMwke4yaxsqkbw=/0x0:1768x1179/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415567/billboard_202101_intro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GIASYa"&gt;At &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220108032348/https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store"&gt;some point in the last month&lt;/a&gt;, Apple introduced a new verification process in the US that tried to ensure customers who want to benefit from its discounted education pricing are actually involved in education. Now Apple has removed the verification process, as confirmed in tests by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and backed up by reports from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/21/apple-no-education-verification-requirement/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/21/apple-education-store-verification-removed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When it was in place, customers had to verify that they actually qualified for an education discount using Unidays’ third-party verification service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y55hu8"&gt;It’s possible that the verification requirement, which was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s7g5t6/apple_education_store_now_requires_unidays_and/"&gt;spotted by Reddit users&lt;/a&gt;, will return. Apple already has verification processes in place in other countries, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/education-pricing?afid=p238%7Cs5Jg5FlGg-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_349151339418_pgrid_15144757333_&amp;amp;cid=aos-uk-kwgo-edu%E2%80%94slid%E2%80%94bran-product-"&gt;like the UK&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t immediately respond to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on whether the verification requirement’s removal was temporary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VQhQZD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matching a similar policy in the UK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MOJnNg"&gt;Customers have also noticed Apple placing new limits on how many items you can buy with an educational discount. &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/apple-tightens-education-discounts-with-account-verification-and-purchase-limits/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Track&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that users are limited to one desktop computer, one Mac mini, one laptop, two iPads, and two accessories per year. (These limits are &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/browse/open/salespolicies/edu"&gt;still listed on Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt;, despite verification being gone.) Given that it’s more than any student, teacher, or educational staff member is likely to purchase for themselves in a given year, the limit seems to be in place to stop them from acting as a discount broker for all their non-education friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZrydR"&gt;Although the change (potentially temporarily) removed a loophole that was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17169108/apple-education-discount-how-to-new-ipad"&gt;ridiculously easy&lt;/a&gt; to exploit — apparently Apple didn’t even require customers to have a .edu email address — there was surprisingly little outcry over on Reddit, with some pointing out that Apple’s first-party discounts are often beaten by third-party retailers during back to school season. Meanwhile, if you’re looking for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;good deal on a MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve got a page dedicated to that exact purpose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvMGC0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 4:58PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the Unidays’ verification seems to have been removed from Apple’s US education store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI’s 32-inch, curved gaming monitor is on sale at Walmart for $160 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZl33K8GAco_RN48g11EMpFBqro=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416960/Optix_MAG321CQR_Press_Image.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The budget-friendly panel packs a 144Hz refresh rate and 1440p resolution.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: MSI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGsaOQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 5:03PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woot has sold through its available stock of the Xbox Series S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWzAGC"&gt;If you’re a PC gamer, one of MSI’s best gaming monitors is now on sale at Walmart. The MSI Optix MAG321CQR normally retails $449.99 but is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMSI-Optix-31-5-16-9-QHD-RGB-LED-Non-Glare-Super-Narrow-Bezel-1ms-2560-x-1440-144Hz-Refresh-Rate-Free-Sync-Height-Adjustable-Curved-Gaming-Monitor-Bla%2F866580873%3Fathcpid%3D866580873%26athpgid%3DAthenaItempage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3Dsi%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS004%26athguid%3DETq9k2xgFeUvULajDCcvVFd9f8WBYvi8ca8L%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $289.99 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This 32-inch curved gaming panel comes equipped with all the bells and whistles you need to elevate your gaming setup. The Optix lands in a sweet spot by combining a 144Hz refresh rate with 1440p resolution, striking a solid balance between performance and visual fidelity. In addition to the expected HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, the monitor also features a pair of USB-A ports for power and a single port for data. The included stand is height and tilt adjustable, too, and the monitor is compatible with VESA mounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xB7jB1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="W4EE4l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MSI Creator Z16 review: thin isn’t everything","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22893308/msi-creator-z16-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LsNspc"&gt;While nabbing an Xbox Series S isn’t as difficult as getting your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X these days, Microsoft’s pearly white console is still in high demand. Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup012122/https://www.woot.com/offers/microsoft-xbox-series-s-512gb-3?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_13" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is hosting a deal on the Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt;, reducing its regular $299.99 price tag to $279.99. This isn’t a massive discount by any means but it matches the best price we’ve ever seen for this console. The Series S isn’t quite as powerful as the Series X with some of the key distinctions being a lack of a physical disc drive, less storage space, and a less powerful processor. However, the console is still home to fantastic first-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and is compatible with a massive library of last-gen titles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2022/1/20/22892969/xbox-games-360-original-backward-compatible-digital-sale-deal-microsoft"&gt;many of which are currently on sale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BCriBu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="G6Hwfq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Microsoft building a gaming monopoly?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22889435/microsoft-activision-blizzard-game-pass-cloud-gaming-monopoly-ftc-questions"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="syZruq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Tournament-Tenkeyless-Keyboard/dp/B07V25YPVW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfA7Lbj8DI4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are currently offering a deep discount on Razer’s original, tournament-style keyboard. The Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition is on sale right now for $79.99, a healthy $50 off the usual price tag. This isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen, but it’s a decent value for anyone in the market for a TKL model. Just like other TKL keyboards, the Tournament Edition ditches the number pad and dedicated media playback buttons for a slimmer design that presents you with the essentials you need for gaming, in addition to the handy function row and navigation keys. It also uses Razer’s proprietary linear optical switches for smooth and rapid key presses, as well as a standardized keycap layout that allows you to swap out custom keycaps for a more personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aeIloN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10721765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WwN5hz"&gt;Whether you need something to help keep your floors tidy or just a robotic chariot for your resident feline, the iRobot Roomba j7 is a solid option. Normally $649.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Wi-Fi-Connected-Vacuum/dp/B094NW318F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has recently discounted this model to $399.99&lt;/a&gt;. One of the smartest automated cleaning solutions for your home, the j7 can clean on a schedule or handle messes immediately with the help of the Roomba app or Alexa and Google voice assistants. This model also features integrated obstacle avoidance, which allows it to easily navigate furniture and other large objects, but also ensures that it won’t accidentally choke on an errant iPhone charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aorc8r"&gt;Perhaps most importantly, however, the j7 features good battery life and is capable of avoiding poop and other pet messes it can’t handle effectively. One small caveat to this otherwise well-rounded robovac is that, unlike the more expensive iRobot Roomba j7 Plus, it lacks an auto-empty base, meaning you will need to empty the bin manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vJogxi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10989422"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="pMIFLC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iRobot Roomba j7 Plus vs. JetBot AI Plus: can these robot vacuums pass the poop test?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22880352/irobot-roomba-j7-plus-samsung-jet-bot-ai-plus-robot-vacuum-review-comparison-test"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="o6uTso"&gt;The Roccat Vulcan Pro keyboard represents one of the less conventional designs in the gaming keyboard space. Currently, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROCCAT-Vulcan-Optical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08J4HQGZ2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab this unique keyboard for $129.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a substantial drop from its usual price of $199.99 and the lowest price we’ve seen for this keyboard to date. The Vulcan Pro features a full-size layout with dedicated media playback buttons and a remarkably slim chassis. The slim style extends to the keycap design, which rests on top of the switches rather than around them, giving the keyboard the aesthetic of a sci-fi typewriter and providing a more prominent display for the RGB backlighting. One final feature that makes this keyboard unique is the software. The Roccat Neon software (formerly swarm) allows you to add custom typing sounds to your keyboard if you’re feeling nostalgic for that classic clicky sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hFqAze"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10989321"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Beats Fit Pro get their first major discount and drop to $153 (update: no longer available)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQEt-_8D2BkuiFz7ldNZ8js-RGg=/0x39:1419x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416262/_BeatsFitPro_4FAM_Lifestyle_0036_WEB_v4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro come in black, gray, white, and pink. Today’s deal is on the black and white colorways.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vc0Erx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 1:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro deals at both Amazon and Walmart are no longer available at this time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAAegS"&gt;Time and time again, we see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"&gt;Apple AirPods and AirPods Pro wireless earbuds getting frequent discounts and deals&lt;/a&gt;. In general, if you want to buy any pair of true wireless earbuds — with active noise cancellation or without — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"&gt;you should be able to find a deal somewhere&lt;/a&gt;. One holdout that has been elusive up to now was the Beats Fit Pro. These latest models from Apple-owned Beats came out in late 2021 and surprised us with how good they are — even besting the AirPods Pro in the sound quality department. They have held steady at their $199.99 price point the whole time, but now they finally see a discount of about $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hePsYN"&gt;Today, you can pick up the Beats Fit Pro on sale from Amazon and Walmart. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B09JL41N9C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has both black and white colorways for $153.11&lt;/a&gt; (add it to your cart to see the price), while &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Fit-Pro-True-Wireless-Earbuds-Beats-Black%2F232379973&amp;amp;subid1=beatsfitprobreakout012122" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart has the black model matched at the same price&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart also has the white model on sale, but its discount is not as sizable. The funkier gray and purple colors remain at full price, but nothing beats black and white in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KNqYcD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844241"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TESug6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;In our review of the Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Welch found the wing tips to be comfortable over long listening sessions — offering a more secure fit than the AirPods Pro. The sound quality is excellent, and the active noise cancellation and transparency mode are of the same caliber you expect from Apple and the AirPods Pro. The biggest caveats of these earbuds are their more limited functionality with Android phones and their lack of wireless charging. You have to plug the case in via USB-C, which is still nice to have in lieu of a Lightning port. At this discounted price, it’s easier to overlook these flaws, and if you use Apple products, you get all the conveniences of the H1 chip and deeper OS integration and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Godzilla and the Titans will reunite in new Apple TV Plus Monsterverse series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Godzilla on the international poster for Godzilla vs. Kong." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45pKet-PFR8RYzZi3pDwz3DED9U=/0x290:1773x1472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414303/hLCgtLL.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Legendary Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Y5a1d"&gt;Though Legendary’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/24/22246258/new-trailers-godzilla-kong-comrades-son-south-hbo-max-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;made waves last summer by debuting on HBO Max and quickly becoming one of the platform’s &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/godzilla-vs-kong-opening-weekend-analysis-1234943958/"&gt;top performing features&lt;/a&gt;, the next time we see the titanic monster and his fellow kaiju, they’ll be calling new streamer home: Apple Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ucS26"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2022/01/apple-tv-lands-epic-godzilla-and-titans-original-television-series-based-on-legendarys-monsterverse/"&gt;Apple Plus announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has greenlit a new live-action series set in Legendary’s Monsterverse from co-creators Chris Black (&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;) and Matt Fraction, writer of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22849870/hawkeye-season-1-review-disney-plus"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;run that the recent Disney Plus series heavily draws from. Along with Black and Fraction, Toho’s Hiro Matsuoka and Takemasa Arita and Safe House Pictures’ Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell are set to executive produce. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Legendary’s Monsterverse logo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mT_dA9FrrjwInPKyfHJC3vXl4RM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183187/012022_Apple_Lands_Series_Legendarys_Monsterverse_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Legendary&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Legendary’s Monsterverse logo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l3eVgs"&gt;Set after the events of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, the new untitled series is said to feature Godzilla, a number of the Titans, and yet another human family whose interpersonal dramas audiences are &lt;em&gt;meant &lt;/em&gt;to care about even though the literal monsters are what everyone’s really interested in. According to Apple, the new human family at the center of this show will have  deep, mysterious connections to Monarch, the mysterious organization that’d been studying Godzilla and the Titans while also working to hide the creatures’ existences from the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hR1GdZ"&gt;Considering how humans have pretty consistently dragged the Monsterverse’s features down in the past, the series is going to have to find a way to legitimately make their plots here feel like more than distractions from the good stuff (read: monster fights). But depending on which monsters show up and how they fight, it might be worth slogging  through a little bit of ground level human humdrum when the show debuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJdsV"&gt;Currently, there’s been no word on when the new Monsterverse series will begin production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlAz14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 21, 10:55 AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this post misidentified Monarch as the organization that drove the Titans to fight in Godzilla vs. Kong. Apex, the corporation Monarch partnered with in the film, was actually responsible. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirBuddy 2.5 for macOS adds better Bluetooth control for some non-Apple headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dvv2vF9wZ1fkFO0fYhG0UJrcE2o=/550x0:2950x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413541/Proximity_Engine_2___No_Text.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;AirBuddy 2.5 has a new “Proximity Engine” v2 that should detect and hand off peripherals faster. | Image: Buddy Software&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nN1n5y"&gt;A new version of AirBuddy for macOS Monterey is available starting today, adding the option to quickly shift some non-Apple Bluetooth headphones and other devices between Macs and iPhones. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18200945/airbuddy-mac-app-connecting-airpods-bluetooth"&gt;original&lt;/a&gt; AirBuddy app for macOS that launched in 2019 was a simple solution to let AirPods interface with your Mac just as seamlessly as they already did on iOS devices — complete with the animated pop-up many iPhone users are accustomed to seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1q72T"&gt;AirBuddy 2.5 takes advantage of new under-the-hood macOS Monterey changes to enable things like low battery notifications, switching from transparency mode to noise-canceling on AirPods that are not even currently outputting sound from the Mac, and easy control over automatic switching between devices. This version also lets power users take advantage of more actions in the Shortcuts app and create automation (to check battery level or quickly connect and disconnect) and profiles. A complete list of the actions that can be performed is published on the &lt;a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/AirBuddy25ReleaseNotes"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HPCDyS"&gt;AirBuddy now works with some third-party devices in macOS Monterey, such as the Sony WF and WH series headsets. These devices don’t have Apple’s W1 or H1 chip, so functionality is limited. They are only shown while connected to the Mac, but can be pinned to the list for quick connection. Battery alerts can also be configured for such devices, as long as they provide battery information to macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="EYd2is"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This one was a “never gonna happen” item on my list, until Apple decided to start showing battery information for some third-party Bluetooth devices in macOS Monterey   &lt;a href="https://t.co/9qZ1yhZYfB"&gt;https://t.co/9qZ1yhZYfB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1483524849565941767?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aYJoC6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was provided a beta release to try out the new features, so we installed it on a Mac running the latest version of macOS Monterey and another Mac running macOS Big Sur (both systems are M1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T_2AlmF8OyQaqczJBTyPe89D4cQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182482/Screen_Shot_2022_01_20_at_12.31.03_AM.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MkKTGX"&gt;I had access to a pair of Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds and some LG &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/29/9217709/samsung-level-u-earbuds-review-neckbuds"&gt;neckbuds&lt;/a&gt; and was able to add them to my devices in AirBuddy on macOS Monterey. Unfortunately, this and some other features did not work in Big Sur since this is a beta release specifically designed for Monterey. The developer plans to release AirBuddy 2.5 for older macOS versions next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I84xQTYHJ0XG_jhz18JnZvXu6Mk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182572/Image_1_20_22_at_1.46_PM.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Tone HBS800 neckbuds also worked!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ4gWQ"&gt;The hero feature of the new AirBuddy is a faster connection switch using what developer Guilherme Rambo (a former &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; writer) is calling Proximity Engine 2.0 — “a complete overhaul of the AirBuddy Bluetooth Low Energy stack that talks to your AirPods, faster and more reliable than ever.” From our testing, AirPods and Beats Solo headsets popped up within a second, which feels faster than how it shows up on iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLIdqv"&gt;AirBuddy is not the only app with Bluetooth handoff abilities, but AirBuddy feels more like an OS feature and not an app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXKmy8jmvOLQmreIuzPBQewL8hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182418/IMG_1475.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Beats Solo with W1 chip show up just like it would on iOS. For context on why it appears as the Club Collection blue color, I transplanted the parts of the broken Beats Solo 3 into the body of the special edition Space Gray Beats Solo 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4L2Lhy"&gt;For me, the most useful feature is easily handing off the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad to a second Mac (available in the previous version of AirBuddy as well). I’m currently working on two MacBook Air M1s, and to swap my Keyboard and external Trackpad between them, I plug a USB-C hub into the computer I want to work on and rely on the Lightning charge cable to re-sync to the other computer. It sounds cumbersome but I’m quick about it. And with Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832765/universal-control-apple-macos-monterey-ipad-delay-spring"&gt;further delaying&lt;/a&gt; Universal Control (which lets you drag and drop files and windows between two Macs while also using one set of peripherals), AirBuddy is a good wireless KVM-ish type of solution for me, right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cut4BOl5EknR-98vedjv95JUgN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182386/Screen_Shot_2022_01_19_at_12.55.54_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A warning for beta users that configured battery alerts may need to be set up again (and assurance that the bug isn’t in the final release). If you’re wondering what Show me a Puppy does, it links to this delightful &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/629448485423385502/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;picture of a zoomy Corgi pup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RaPhpk"&gt;The 2.5 update is available for free to anyone who has purchased AirBuddy 2.0 (as an automatic update on macOS Monterey, with older OSes receiving them next week). For new customers, the price is $9.99 — higher than the minimum $5 charge for the original version but the same price since the 2.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s head of comms is leaving after less than a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tFaT8eBJvboBnGos5OGy4bVUSq4=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413485/1236193236.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dedh8I"&gt;Apple is renowned for a culture of secrecy, one that’s managed in no small part by the company’s head of communications. But it’s had a hard time filling that role, with the most recent entrant — &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-taps-stella-low-as-new-communications-chief"&gt;Stella Low, formerly Cisco’s PR chief&lt;/a&gt; — now leaving after less than a year on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zjgpi"&gt;Fifteen-year Apple vet Kristin Huguet Quayle is taking over, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1484240198758240261"&gt;according to journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-new-head-of-pr-kristin-huguet?d_id=3072577&amp;amp;ref=bftwfwd&amp;amp;utm_source=dynamic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=bftwfwd"&gt;BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski&lt;/a&gt;. Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; that she’s been promoted effective immediately, as Low leaves to spend more time with her family. The previous comms boss, Steve Dowling, left in September 2019, and Apple left the role open for nearly two years before hiring Low last May. (During that time, long-time Apple marketing and App Store boss Phil Schiller reportedly stood in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5v1V2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Longtime &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; PR exec (15 years) Kristin Huguet Quayle is taking over as VP, Worldwide Comms of the world’s most valuable company, a very big job given all the regulatory issues, products to come (hello AR glasses &amp;amp; autonomous cars) and the metaverseness of it all.&lt;/p&gt;— Kara Swisher (@karaswisher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1484240198758240261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kBYobq"&gt;Between Dowling and Low, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;Apple became the world’s most valuable publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, got itself into the (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893546/epic-apple-fortnite-appeal-app-store-restrictions"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, and became embroiled in all kinds of scrutiny from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/9/11/20859972/apple-antitrust-app-store-search-tax-warren"&gt;antitrust enforcers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;app store users&lt;/a&gt;, and its own employees — the ones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest"&gt;could maybe bring its fortress of secrecy toppling down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUkbSl"&gt;Apple’s PR chief before that, Katie Cotton, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/11627500/goodbye-to-all-that-today-is-katie-cottons-last-day-at-apple"&gt;set the tone for the company’s communications&lt;/a&gt; for 18 years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5794104/apple-is-reportedly-looking-for-a-friendlier-head-of-public-relations"&gt;Apple was reportedly looking for a “friendlier, more approachable” successor&lt;/a&gt; after she left. I’m curious if the company’s relationship with the press will change again now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic pushes to overturn App Store ruling in opening appeal brief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfiBnPuc2aWphDwXvOUKu6dKoKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413310/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzTaud"&gt;Epic Games has filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21182876-epic-appeal-opening-brief"&gt;its opening brief&lt;/a&gt; to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking to overturn the previous ruling that Apple’s control over the iOS App Store does not qualify as a monopoly. The company first gave notice of it appeal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, but Thursday’s filing is the first time it has laid out its argument at length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n123RE"&gt;“Epic proved at trial that Apple retrains trade...by contractually requiring developers to exclusively use Apple’s App Store to distribute apps and Apple’s IAP for payments for digital content within apps,” the filing reads. “If not overturned, [the district court] decision would upend established principles of antitrust law and...undermine sound antitrust policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAcyoS"&gt;Epic’s first legal challenge to Apple’s App Store restrictions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;came to a finish in September&lt;/a&gt;, when a district court ordered Apple to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;roll back some restrictions on in-app payments&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise cleared the company of antitrust charges. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;A separate appeal from Apple&lt;/a&gt; has been filed to reverse the new in-app payment rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KICvp"&gt;In her ruling, Judge Gonzales Rogers was particularly ambiguous on the question of whether Apple held monopoly power over the mobile gaming market. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power, or monopoly power, with its considerable market share,” she wrote in the decision. “Apple is only saved by the fact that its share is not higher, that competitors from related submarkets are making inroads into the mobile gaming submarket, and, perhaps, because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0wyxZ"&gt;In the appeals brief, Epic seems determined to revisit that question, and draw a clearer link between the iPhone’s success as a mobile gaming platform and a potential monopoly case against Apple. “The district court’s factual findings make clear,”  the filing alleges, “that Apple’s conduct is precisely what the antitrust laws prohibit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tL3C3o"&gt;Reached for comment, Apple emphasized the broad scope of economic activity taking place on the App Store, as evidence of its ongoing competitive value. “In its ruling last year, the district court confirmed that Apple is not a monopolist in any relevant market and that its agreements with app developers are legal under antitrust laws,” said Apple spokesperson Marni Goldberg. “We are confident that the rulings challenged by Epic will be affirmed on appeal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G19eu0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included statement from Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are personally lobbying senators against antitrust legislation: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-LIFESTYLE-APPLE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgEeo5Gn3bN60msYwvZmF4lS3gk=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411252/1032853198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read NOAH BERGER/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wCISDb"&gt;The United States’ biggest tech companies are seriously worried about new antitrust legislation. So much so that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have been personally “calling and meeting with senators,” urging them to oppose the mooted legislation, according to a &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/punchbowl-news-am-1-18-22/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Punchbowl News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that cites “​​multiple Senate aides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZJVRO"&gt;The legislation in question is &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3816/text?r=8&amp;amp;s=1"&gt;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&lt;/a&gt;, a bipartisan bill spearheaded by Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The legislation is currently in its early stages, and is set to be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee today. The bill would need to pass votes from both the House and Senate to become law, but it’s still easy to see why it’s ruffling feathers with Silicon Valley’s biggest beasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VJSCyS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The legislation only affects the biggest US tech firms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NAJ6oL"&gt;The legislation prohibits online platforms from advantaging their own “products, services, or lines of business” over those of rivals. It applies only to the biggest tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Facebook-owner Meta, and Alphabet’s Google (though &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/u-s-antitrust-bill-expanded-to-include-tiktok-tencent-s-wechat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it will be expanded to cover Chinese tech giants TikTok and WeChat, too). These platforms would be barred from behavior like biasing search results in their favor, limiting rivals’ access to platform data, and using non-public data from customers to compete against them (activities that companies including &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-changed-search-algorithm-in-ways-that-boost-its-own-products-11568645345"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22544921/european-commission-google-antitrust-investigation-ad-tech-advertising-services"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are accused of).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztjJyh"&gt;Although the exact impact of the legislation is difficult to predict, one aspect that worries Apple in particular is a possible threat to its App Store business model. In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890100/antitrust-bill-apple-google-big-tech-senate"&gt;letter sent by the company&lt;/a&gt; to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Apple said that if the bill became law it would be forced to allow users to “sideload” apps onto iPhones and iPads as it does Macs — meaning installing them from sources outside the App Store. Apple says this threatens the security of its users by allowing unvetted apps onto devices, and cuts into one of its main revenue streams (Apple collects up to 30 percent commission on App Store sales). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EZF9j"&gt;In response to Apple’s arguments, a spokesperson for Klobuchar &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “The bill does not force Apple to allow unscreened apps onto Apple devices. All of Apple’s arguments about ‘sideloading’ really amount to a desperate attempt to preserve their app store monopoly, which they use to charge huge fees from businesses they are competing against.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVoGXM"&gt;Although the Klobuchar-Grassley bill is roundly opposed by tech’s largest companies, smaller players have &lt;a href="https://wesupportsb2992.medium.com/re-s-2992-the-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act-f49cc61abd87"&gt;come out in support of the legislation&lt;/a&gt;. A coalition of 35 tech firms recently wrote a letter to the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee arguing that the legislation is necessary to curb “the many anticompetitive self-preferencing tactics dominant technology companies use to attain and entrench their gatekeeper status.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYvh3v"&gt;“For too long, dominant technology companies have made it difficult for other businesses to compete in the digital marketplace by abusing their gatekeeper status to give themselves and their partners preferential treatment and access on their platforms,” said the letter’s signatories, which include DuckDuckGo, Patreon, Sonos, Wyze, and Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYg3I5"&gt;It’s not the first time Big Tech’s top executives have personally mobilized against antitrust legislation. Last year, when US politicians were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;considering five new antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt;, Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546286/apple-tim-cook-nancy-pelosi-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-lobbying"&gt;called Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; to “deliver a warning” against the impact of “rushed” legislation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how to clean your $19 Apple cleaning cloth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OUWNdpAMJQaWMPg0BN1He4njZkE=/143x0:1859x1144/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410545/MM6F3_AV2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can’t just throw it in the wash.&lt;/em&gt; | Image of cloth: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fkw4NC"&gt;Here’s the scenario: you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878673/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online"&gt;managed to get your hands on&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s hottest product, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;$19 polishing cloth&lt;/a&gt; meant for cleaning nano-texture screens and other Apple devices. But oh no! Instead of hanging it up with the rest of your priceless artifacts, you accidentally used it to actually clean something, and now it’s &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt;. Thankfully, Apple has bestowed us with a guide on how to make our cloth good as new, and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/19/apple-explains-how-to-clean-its-polishing-cloth-without-buying-a-new-polishing-cloth/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; has brought those instructions to our attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="howto-title"&gt;Are you ready? Here’s how Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210229"&gt;“How to clean the nano-texture glass on your Apple display” support article&lt;/a&gt; describes the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="p6tXWq"&gt;1. Hand wash the polishing cloth with dish soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxbtus"&gt;2. Rinse thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJZx08"&gt;3. Allow the polishing cloth to air dry for at least 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vuuGd8"&gt;The instructions have been on Apple’s website for at least a few months, according to the WayBack Machine, but despite a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-polishing-cloth"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/26/apples-cleaning-cloth-is-sold-out-through-january----get-this-instead"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; mentioning them, I hadn’t come across them. That’s really a shame — other people who also hadn’t known about the instructions might’ve been throwing away their priceless polishers all because of a little grime, wasting $20 simply because the cleaning instructions are buried on a support page instead of being included on a tag, or embossed on the cloth itself. (I would also settle for prime placement on the Apple home page, where all people of the cloth spend their day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of0Mv0"&gt;The instructions themselves are also a little disappointing — ultimately, Apple is telling us to wash the cloth like we would any other delicate fabric. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878673/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online"&gt;At least it’s back in stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV Plus teases its WeWork series with Jared Leto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qaqc5gTRluquHR5cZVdYm-1xw40=/0x0:4664x3109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410005/Apple_TV_WeCrashed_key_art.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JTUWwi"&gt;A new trailer gives us a glimpse of Apple TV Plus’ &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming miniseries about the real-life buildup and dramatic downfall of WeWork, the coworking space with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;weirdly bombastic public filing&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975831/wework-layoffs-ipo-adam-neumann-softbank"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; thousands of employees while later giving its brash CEO a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926583/wework-founder-adam-neumann-softbank-takeover-payout"&gt;huge golden parachute&lt;/a&gt;. The script practically writes itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urg8uV"&gt;Jared Leto stars as WeWork’s former eccentric CEO, Adam Neumann, while Anne Hathaway takes on the role of his wife, Rebekah Neumann, who served as the company’s chief brand and impact officer and was former CEO of WeGrow. The trailer opens with Leto reimagining a run-down building as a vibrant office space — and then making that vision a reality. Leto and Hathaway are then seen leading a “WeWork” chant in front of a crowd, emphasizing the almost hypnotic energy of the company and its leaders. The company managed to secure a $47 billion valuation before ultimately plummeting to just $9 billion as the company went public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ1hC4"&gt;The series is based on the &lt;a href="https://wondery.com/shows/we-crashed/"&gt;Wondery podcast &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed: The Rise and Fall of WeWork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is set to debut on Apple TV Plus on March 18th, with new episodes airing every Friday until April 22nd. Last year, Hulu created a documentary that followed the WeWork rollercoaster ride, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22358602/wework-documentary-adam-neumann-hulu"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fe9Z1y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEQP4VVuyrY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwKHAI"&gt;Also coming to Apple TV Plus is &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt;, a series that depicts the ultimate balance between work and home. Adam Scott plays Mark Scout, a manager at Lumon Industries, who undergoes a procedure called “severance.” The procedure splits Scout’s (and his co-workers’) personal and work-related memories — when he’s at the office, he has no memory of his home life and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLrnjA"&gt;The trailer shows what seems to be Scout’s verbal acknowledgment of the procedure’s risks. It also previews the robotic interactions that take place between him and co-workers, as well as hints at a darker mystery brewing inside the workplace. &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt; premieres on February 18th and is produced by Ben Stiller.&lt;/p&gt;
