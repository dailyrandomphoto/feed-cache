    <title>Judge buys Rittenhouse lawyer’s inane argument that Apple’s pinch-to-zoom manipulates footage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Trial Continues In Kenosha, WI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zDVoE_-vlqC4mlIOTgC89V94i-Q=/0x0:5043x3362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125363/1236486033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Krajacic-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vmv9F2"&gt;As Kyle Rittenhouse took the stand to answer questions about the sequence of events before he shot and killed a man in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the jury was forced to watch the video evidence play out in miniature — because Rittenhouse’s defense lawyer came up with the wild notion that Apple has “artificial intelligence” that manipulates footage when you pinch-to-zoom on an iPad, and Judge Bruce Schroeder totally bought into that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="raJUzK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The word he’s looking for is algorithms, but that’s beside the point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYw2Ho"&gt;“iPads, which are made by Apple, have artificial intelligence in them that allow things to be viewed through three-dimensions and logarithms,” the defense insisted. “It uses artificial intelligence, or their logarithms, to create what they believe is happening. So this isn’t actually enhanced video, this is Apple’s iPad programming creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltjm5U"&gt;While it’s unclear from a full video of the proceedings (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIzj48oL6T0&amp;amp;t=18145s"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) whether the judge actually prohibited the prosecution from using an iOS device or otherwise zooming into the footage, the result was the same: instead of using an iPad, the jury wound up watching the original, zoomed-out clips on a Windows machine hooked up to a large TV in the courtroom. The images didn’t fill the TV’s entire screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zoKjo"&gt;Judge Schroeder argued that it was the prosecution — not the defense — that had the burden of proving that Apple &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; use artificial intelligence to manipulate footage, demanding that they provide an expert to testify, and didn’t allow the prosecution to adjourn to find that expert before bringing Rittenhouse up for cross-examination. The judge suggested that prosecutors could somehow find that expert while they took a brief 20-minute recess. “Maybe you can get someone to testify on this within minutes, I don’t know,” said the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dD9xmb"&gt;While the nature of reality with regards to digital images is thorny when it comes to things like color, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling"&gt;digital image scaling&lt;/a&gt; is fairly well understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GflCas"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/kyle-rittenhouse-charges.html"&gt;six criminal charges&lt;/a&gt; against Rittenhouse in connection to the shooting in Kenosha. He’s accused of killing two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3Iuii"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail’s upcoming iOS widget could actually be useful</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EY5kSu3I_3iWhioAyqtaA8cXnPs=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125299/gmail_widget.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BCy6If"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/stay-productive-these-google-features-ios/"&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s updating the Gmail iOS widget with a new one that’s actually useful, showing you the subjects and senders of the emails sitting in your inbox. The company says the new widget will be “launching in the next few weeks,” to replace the previous version that wasn’t particularly well-received. This also means that, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/10/gmail-ios-widget-meet-sheets/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, this means that Gmail’s iOS widget will have the same functionality as the current Android one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5lXgJ"&gt;When the first version of the Gmail widget launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574112/google-new-gmail-widget-ios-14-limitations"&gt;we pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that it isn’t particularly helpful. It really only provides shortcuts to different screens on the app like your inbox and the email composer. Critically, it doesn’t actually show you much information about the emails you’ve received, though it does tell you how many are sitting unread in your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14nvlngEXOqt5quLjsKEo8_jzg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004270/Old_Widget.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old widget can only take to to the app’s search, compose, and inbox screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VCvrrd"&gt;Part of the old widget’s lack of functionality was due to Apple’s limitations. You’re currently not allowed to build interactivity into your widget, and any tapping the user does has to be handled by launching the app. Those rules haven’t substantially changed since the first widget was introduced, but the new design shows that there’s still room for useful information. You may not be able to archive an email from your home screen, for example, but you’ll at least be able to get a feel for what’s waiting in your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df821sd9pAlX_97Fz1mqYrEM-wY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004197/Sheets_Keyboardshortcuts.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google also says it’s updating Google Sheets’ keyboard shortcut support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s05ZO5"&gt;Google also announced other upcoming improvements to its apps that could be useful for heavy users of its services. Meet (it’s business-focused video chat app) is getting support for iOS’s picture-in-picture feature, so you can still see your co-workers or the presentation while you switch apps to check on a file or email. Google also says it’ll expand the keyboard shortcuts available for people who use Google Sheets with an external keyboard (including Apple’s Magic Keyboard case).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will soon let you pass on your iCloud data when you die </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oBZI9ivVRiNFnV9ZrEB2Al6OUiE=/375x0:4422x2698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123890/Claim_Request___iPad.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Digital Legacy program lets users choose up to five people who can access their iCloud account when they pass away.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xZ0p1D"&gt;Apple is solving a complicated problem with its latest iOS update: right of survivorship. Until now, when a loved one or family member dies, there was no easy way to access their iCloud account and absolutely no way of unlocking their phone without knowing their passcode. According to the&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/legal/internet-services/icloud/en/terms.html"&gt; iCloud terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, the deceased person’s data goes with them even with a death certificate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0yJO5"&gt;With the new Digital Legacy program, first announced at &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__youtu.be_0TD96VTf0Xs-3Ft-3D3250&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=HTakECkqD13F_4No8TePr7snOg-TM_Z0bAqwspVK1Ig&amp;amp;m=fItzX2rODQv7RTBNSewxVHMkya7KOGU1oXhxAzEMZPr6hl7x3l__BXbSpMvo-Oet&amp;amp;s=C1TZjvKT6GLXL0Ujl0iCXyP3v_KcOvP9Mlxi4sdZ8NY&amp;amp;e="&gt;WWDC earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; and arriving in iOS 15.2, you can designate up to five people as Legacy Contacts. These individuals can then access your data and personal information stored in iCloud when you die, such as photos, documents, and even purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTcY2F"&gt;To activate Digital Legacy, Apple still requires proof of death and an access key. Still, it’s a much more simplified process than before, which could require a court order confirming a right to inheritance, and even then, there was no guarantee you would get access to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsBjJm"&gt;This has been a complicated situation for Apple, which has long touted its core principles of protecting users’ privacy. &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/01/technology/leonardo-fabbretti-apple/index.html"&gt;Grieving parents&lt;/a&gt; and spouses railing against the company for not giving them access to their spouses’ photos isn’t a good look. But neither is doling out people’s data willy-nilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OicCfd"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3036546"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/991335594313139"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have systems in place for designating account access to other people, and it’s good to see Apple catching up here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/940cfO0OkQ_5sDIpdxvW-ApWX20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003129/Legacy_Contact_Setup___iPhone.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set up your Legacy Contacts in Settings on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="cGLS0b"&gt;How to set up a Legacy Contact &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="4J6udT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(note you need to be running iOS 15.2 to access this feature)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QNxQyr"&gt;On an iOS device, go to Settings &amp;gt; [your name] &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mLmW5J"&gt;On a Mac, go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oIRNAU"&gt;Under Legacy Contact, follow the instructions to add a Legacy Contact. If you use Family Sharing, you can choose a family member from the list; alternatively, add someone using their email or phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CD5ZzW"&gt;Notify your Legacy Contact and share an access key via Messages. If they accept, a copy of the access key is automatically stored in their Apple ID settings. If they decline, you will receive a notification. The access key is required to get into your account if you pass away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PRSBZY"&gt;While you can add a Legacy Contact who isn’t on iOS 15.2, they won’t be able to store the access key in the settings on their device, so you should provide it to them in another way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uspE8A"&gt;Legacy Contact is part of the Digital Legacy program and is available now in the public beta version of iOS 15.2 for iPhone. It will be broadly accessible when iOS 15.2 fully launches. Apple hasn’t said which version of macOS will support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltlITw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro vs. Pixel 6 Pro: what 2,000 photos tell us</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wh4LrChgh-_HYNao1Gus5lOdFho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121885/BFARSACE_FULLFRAME_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k3ztZx"&gt;When the iPhone 13 Pro launched earlier this fall, we said it had the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;“best camera” in a smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. The larger sensor behind the main wide-angle lens coupled with a wider f/1.5 aperture left us saying, “Whoa, look at this photo,” more often than we were used to. But a few weeks later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, with its 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images, was finally released, proving a worthy competitor for the iPhone 13 Pro’s 12-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-51a5mInUeU_ZboyZk_s8FIAOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863264/akrales_210917_4760_0441.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4yJQvkwWefcAyltTUEaEUkUjOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957778/akrales_211020_4802_0710.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro has a massive 6.7-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ty7jhO"&gt;So this year, in order to settle the score, I set out to take 1,000 photos on each device. I carried them everywhere, annoyed all of my friends by stopping to take photos every other minute, and was ultimately left with a vast range of situations and lighting conditions to compare the photos from these two cameras. Initially, I thought a winner would become obvious around the 200-photo mark, but I quickly realized using these devices was about far more than their end products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ydCHj"&gt;Tune in to my video above, from my camera series &lt;em&gt;Full Frame&lt;/em&gt;, to see what phone ultimately took the gold. Or visit the &lt;a href="https://adobe.ly/3mFzayJ"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro’s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://adobe.ly/3qscBzQ"&gt;Google Pixel 6 Pro’s&lt;/a&gt; 100 best photos gallery to decide a winner for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUcHeR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjmCcc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMTonE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htnkFr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAILoq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This affordable robot vacuum is even cheaper right now at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yeedi K650 robot vacuum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LImgF3OzO8n6pM-fi7Jb6HsfDlU=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121641/yeedik650skittles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t my house. Skittles operate well outside of the five-second drop rule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLAyaC"&gt;The latest (and even the not-so-new) robot vacuums from iRobot tend to cost, at least, a few hundred dollars. The sky is the limit, so to speak, when it comes to how much these can cost. But there’s a fantastic sale happening at Woot on this affordable model from a company called Yeedi. Its K650 Wi-Fi connected model with an 800-milliliter bin &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142096?sid=VergeDeals111021&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $130 right now&lt;/a&gt;. It’s currently sitting at $180 from Amazon, to give you a sense of how much it usually costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ye8Dz"&gt;This model claims to be great for pet owners, and through its companion app, you can schedule cleaning times, adjust the suction strength, and customize Yeedi’s optional magnetic boundaries, among other things. The Yeedi K650 is compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa smart assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dHMlRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10856865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QlaZd2"&gt;If you need more convincing before you buy,&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s resident smart home expert, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, said this of the K650:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cAURyh"&gt;“For a really basic just-go-do-it, budget bot, the Yeedi is a real bargain and has a huge bin, so you don’t have to empty it as often — you can also &lt;a href="https://www.yeedi.com/products/self-empty-station-yeedi-vac-series"&gt;get a self-empty station to go with it&lt;/a&gt; for another $200. It doesn’t have lidar or virtual boundaries (although there is a more expensive one that does), so you need to &lt;a href="https://www.yeedi.com/collections/accessories/k650"&gt;use magnetic strips&lt;/a&gt; if you want to stop it from going somewhere, but it’s under $200 and it really sucks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="DHZggk"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-97" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkdyLY"&gt;And now for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2P86C-1x3o"&gt;something completely different&lt;/a&gt;, the previous generation of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro that doesn’t have the M1 processor is $200 off at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553831-REG%2Fapple_mxaw2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22772076%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-ipad-pro-sennheiser-oneplus-woot-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $1,300, this sale brings the storage-packed 512GB version down to $1,100. When it originally released, we thought its performance and display were top-notch (it’s still a fantastic device). Its display has True Tone tech that adjusts its color temperature based on your ambient lighting, and it features ProMotion for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, making your content run smoother than ever. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

The sticker price for this phone typically sits at around $600, but as long as you check the coupon box on the product page before you check out, you can save a grand total of $150. The 8T released about a year ago, and it’s an incremental upgrade over the OnePlus 8. But getting 256GB of storage and a 120Hz display at this price point is an excellent value, especially when you throw its Snapdragon 865 processor into the mix. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rCkP7g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9741432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk6IGU"&gt;With the impending release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711110/battlefield-2042-next-cross-gen-digital-standard-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on November 19th, it's the perfect time to gear up with this 500GB SSD from Western Digital. This PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD has been discounted to $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099GC4CRK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a complimentary code for the upcoming entry in the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield &lt;/em&gt;franchise (a $60 value). This essentially makes the SSD just $30 and is a solid value for 500GB of fast storage. If you want to double the storage, the 1TB version of the drive is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN750-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B099FNMV34?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $140&lt;/a&gt;. While this SSD is a perfectly suitable option for anyone looking to expand the storage of their desktop or gaming laptop, you’ll need to invest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;your own heatsink&lt;/a&gt; to attach to it before you install it in your PlayStation 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ktnQBs"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 wireless headphones are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; on the market today. These headphones normally cost $400, but the black-colored set is down to $248, while the white model is just $241 on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3MJBW8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which color you like, this is a solid deal and pretty close to the lowest price we’ve seen for these headphones at any retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoTqn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer&lt;/a&gt; was pleased with the addition of USB-C charging, as well as the incredibly comfortable design. While we admit that the original price was a bit high for what they offer, the Sennheiser Momentum headphones are a much better value at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3fehyd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPSayk"&gt;The delicious-looking Google Nest Mini is currently half price at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1505874-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00781_us_home_mini_charcoal_2nd.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22772076%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-ipad-pro-sennheiser-oneplus-woot-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJA2aQnTKB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/jWQnG5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00781us.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals111021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dorama,&lt;/a&gt; bringing the cost down to $25. This isn’t the lowest-ever price we’ve seen on this home assistant speaker, but nevertheless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; called it “a great sounding upgrade over the Home Mini.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KePwx7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tO18cA"&gt;A couple of other deals to check out...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gkTdGt"&gt;Save $100 on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ6MTC4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy RoboVac 12 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $140. Not quite the lowest price we’ve seen for this device, but it’s still a solid deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Yl4f8"&gt;Amazon is currently offering &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;four months of Kindle Unlimited for just $5&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $40 for a four-month subscription, this service grants you access to over 1 million books, thousands of audiobooks, and monthly issues of your favorite magazines. All of these features are accessible on any Kindle device or via the Kindle app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS beta lets you manually scan for sneaky AirTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlpL7ZBOcfluDDeusfpsZTsseOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121343/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTags were released earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkeFzN"&gt;Among the features added to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/09/new-features-in-ios-15-beta-2/"&gt;iOS 15.2’s second beta&lt;/a&gt; is a new option in the Find My app that lets you manually scan your surroundings for AirTags and other Find My-enabled devices that someone might be using to track you. The feature, which is &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/"&gt;detailed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is accessible via a new “Items That Can Track Me” option listed in the Find My app’s Items menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a5TOm"&gt;Hit the link, and the app will report if there are any devices nearby that aren’t owned by you and which have Apple’s tracking technology enabled. The app can then give instructions on how to disable the device. Alternatively, there’s a “Help Return Lost Items” option for items that have ended up in your vicinity accidentally rather than maliciously, which replaces the previous “Identify Found Item” text.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAfBVZs-g2ti8bb7fk-Yq0K34DE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23002055/apple_unknown_items_scan.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature is accessible from the “Items That Can Track Me” menu item.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45ZZxa"&gt;AirTags are designed to let you keep track of items like keys or a bike in case they’re lost or stolen. The new beta feature is Apple’s latest attempt to assuage critics &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review"&gt;who quickly pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that the tiny AirTags are &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;pretty good at tracking people and identified some shortcomings in the safety features Apple included at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHA2fa"&gt;In June, Apple announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516178/apple-airtags-tracking-devices-update-play-sound-privacy-android-app"&gt;initial series of measures&lt;/a&gt; to address these concerns. So rather than waiting until an AirTag had spent three whole days away from its owner before emitting a warning chime, AirTags now do so after just eight to 24 hours. Apple also announced that it is building an app for Android users to alert them to the presence of unwanted trackers and said that it would be launching later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjZ5xN"&gt;Other tweaks that have arrived with iOS 15.2’s second beta include the introduction of the Legacy Contact feature Apple announced at WWDC 2021, which lets loved ones access your account and personal information in the event of your death. The &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/"&gt;Communication Safety feature for the Messages app is also returning&lt;/a&gt;, although it now won’t notify a parent when nudity is detected in an image. It’ll just blur the image and offer safety resources. There’s also a new Hide My Email option in the mail app, and the interface of the Apple TV app has been tweaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ERa1d"&gt;As with every iOS beta, however, there’s always that chance that any one of these features may be tweaked or removed entirely before its stable release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge orders Apple to allow external payment options for App Store by December 9th, denying stay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zfHbVkLMMQhHZhTITOgrGxiM88k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119772/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r9RfBg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers says Apple must comply with an order to let developers add links and buttons to external payment options, denying the company’s motion for a stay. “Apple’s motion is based on a selective reading of this Court’s findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction,” her new order reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKykar"&gt;Judge Gonzalez Rogers issued her order after a Tuesday hearing concerning the blockbuster antitrust lawsuit, which &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; publisher Epic Games filed in 2020 and which went to trial this year. During the hearing, Apple said it needed more time to rewrite its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;anti-steering policies&lt;/a&gt; — rules that bar app developers from linking to payment methods besides the iOS App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trMA1x"&gt;“This will be the first time Apple has ever allowed live links in an app for digital content. It’s going to take months to figure out the engineering, economic, business, and other issues,” said Apple attorney Mark Perry. “It is exceedingly complicated. There have to be guardrails and guidelines to protect children, to protect developers, to protect consumers, to protect Apple. And they have to be written into guidelines that can be explained and enforced and applied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lwz4gq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple does nothing unless it is forced to do it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kq9mBW"&gt;Apple has mostly praised the ruling in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; — where Judge Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;concluded that Apple hadn’t violated antitrust law&lt;/a&gt; by kicking &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store and said the company didn’t have to reinstate Epic’s developer account. But it appealed the section saying that Apple’s anti-steering policies hid relevant information from users and demanding that it remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztycTy"&gt;Perry noted that Apple already made one of the two required changes. In August, as part of a class action lawsuit settlement, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;removed a rule&lt;/a&gt; restricting how developers could contact users via email. But Apple has portrayed in-app links as a unique threat to user trust and safety, saying they could let developers scam users or send them to malicious sites. “We believe that these changes, if Apple is forced to implement them, will upset the platform. They will harm consumers. They will harm developers. That is a fact. It is going to happen,” said Perry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAZvlT"&gt;Epic framed Apple’s request as a delay tactic made without any real commitment to change. “Apple does nothing unless it is forced to do it,” said Epic attorney Gary Bornstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F4onQB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You haven’t asked for additional time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIx9yQ"&gt;Judge Gonzalez Rogers was skeptical of Apple’s request particularly because it asked for an indefinite stay of the injunction despite saying Apple just wanted more time to evaluate risks. “You haven’t asked for additional time. You’ve asked for an injunction which would effectively take years,” she said. “You asked for an across-the-board stay which could take 3, 4, 5 years.” Perry responded that Apple wanted to delay the changes until the case was resolved — saying that it was confident “we’re going to win the appeal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhANpj"&gt;That didn’t sway the judge: in her order Tuesday evening, she accused Apple of wanting “an open-ended stay with no requirement that it make any effort to comply,” and suggested that “Apple has provided no credible reason for the Court to believe that the injunction would cause the professed devastation,” with regards to the company’s argument that it would be harmed by adding external links to alternate payment systems within apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7KPck"&gt;Apple says it plans to appeal to the Ninth Circuit for a stay, since it didn’t get one from Judge Gonzalez Rogers. “Apple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved. We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,” writes an Apple spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMMHyJ"&gt;Pending a stay of some kind, the injunction is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;scheduled to take effect&lt;/a&gt; on December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson’s CEO joins Apple’s board</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TAypCN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/alex-gorsky-joins-apples-board-of-directors/"&gt;Apple has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s current CEO, Alex Gorsky, will join its board of directors. Gorsky’s move to Apple’s leadership team (he’ll &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/latest-news/johnson-johnsons-2021-third-quarter-earnings-report-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;step down from his role at J&amp;amp;J in January&lt;/a&gt;) comes at a time when the company is focusing even more on health and how it can make data more accessible to users and their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5XdhP"&gt;In the press release announcing Gorsky’s role at Apple, Tim Cook calls him “a visionary in healthcare” who has a “passion for technology.” Apple hasn’t kept its ambitions in health a secret — the Apple Watch is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733073/smartwatch-wearable-health-impact-doctors"&gt;largely seen as a fitness device&lt;/a&gt;, and its users can &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/research-app/"&gt;contribute data to various studies&lt;/a&gt;. Recent updates to iOS and watchOS have brought new health features that make it easier to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22672388/health-app-apple-data-records-allscripts-cerner"&gt;share medical records with doctors&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"&gt;family members&lt;/a&gt;. With Gorsky on the board, Apple could tap him for new feature ideas (such as what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;new sensors it could add to the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;) or use his expertise to add more integrations with the medical establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="V1LvOs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The unexpected health impacts of wearable tech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733073/smartwatch-wearable-health-impact-doctors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mAGIs8"&gt;Apple and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson have existing ties — the two companies are working together on &lt;a href="https://www.heartline.com/about"&gt;the Heartline study&lt;/a&gt;, which is designed to see if the Apple Watch can help detect atrial fibrillation before symptoms become obvious or dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQcTuz"&gt;Apple’s health efforts haven’t been without controversy, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22594178/apple-watch-data-research-heart-rate-reliability"&gt;Some medical researchers have said&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s lack of transparency into its algorithms to measure things like heart rate makes it difficult to use data from Apple Watches in research. There have also been reports from inside Apple that the health division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710901/apple-health-clinic-data-misleading-culture"&gt;uses potentially misleading data to make product decisions&lt;/a&gt;, and employees also raised concerns about Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536623/apple-primary-care-project-data-watch-app"&gt;plans for a trial where it would act as a primary healthcare provider&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBdlcU"&gt;It’s possible that having someone with experience could help Apple navigate these potential hurdles and make the Apple Watch an even more powerful health tool (though Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551723/johnson-stop-selling-opioids-settlement-new-york-lawsuit"&gt;faced&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/"&gt;fair share of controversies&lt;/a&gt; since Gorsky &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/leadership/alex-gorsky"&gt;became CEO in 2012&lt;/a&gt;). It’s also possible that it’s more of a symbolic move to emphasize Apple’s focus on health — we’ll only be able to tell by seeing what Apple does with health in the future or if Grosky appears on stage at WWDC to talk about a collaboration between J&amp;amp;J and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNi04P"&gt;Netflix just brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;its new gaming service to all subscribers on Android&lt;/a&gt;, but now it has officially come to iOS. The service gives users access to a limited selection of mobile games without ads or in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGhJRX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1458133903160479746?s=20"&gt;A tweet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman confirms that the five launch games are already available as individual downloads from the App Store. These include &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/stranger-things-1984/id1574739824"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things: 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/stranger-things-3-the-game/id1574824199"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3: The Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/shooting-hoops/id1585735348"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shooting Hoops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/teeter-up/id1585735663"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teeter (Up)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/card-blast/id1586360462"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Card Blast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The just-announced game &lt;a href="https://hextechmayhem.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  — which will cost $10 on Switch and PC — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772338/league-of-legends-spinoff-netflix-games-nintendo-switch-hextech-mayhem"&gt;will be free to Netflix subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="F3LbhN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix’s gaming push could be its secret sauce for continued domination ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22770244/netflix-gaming-app-launch-android-ios-future"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="u51TzA"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Netflix Games is coming to iOS! Starting tomorrow, you can access Netflix Games through the Netflix app on any mobile device, anywhere in the world. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LoHYFi4xBX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LoHYFi4xBX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458132284909883393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iJK7mE"&gt;There’s been some concern about Netflix Games’ rollout on iOS, particularly because of Apple’s App Store policies that have gotten in the way of other gaming platforms and services. The policy typically prevents third-party apps from acting as storefronts for apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6tSmY"&gt;Per the tweet from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458132284909883393"&gt;@NetflixGeeked&lt;/a&gt;, tomorrow we’ll find out how Netflix adjusts its main app and if it serves as an all-in-one gaming hub as it does on Android, where users can select games to download from the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwMcw8"&gt;Other cloud gaming platforms, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Microsoft xCloud, Nvidia Geforce Now, Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, and Facebook Gaming, have struggled to find footing on iOS due to Apple’s demanding App Store restrictions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;All&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589398/facebook-cloud-gaming-web-app-launch-apple"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; have attempted to sidestep Apple’s policies by launching as web apps, but this obviously doesn’t provide the best gaming experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzjE2u"&gt;However, there might be a precedent for Netflix’s good fortune. In internal emails uncovered in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;Apple went over possible concessions&lt;/a&gt; related to third-party apps offering in-app purchases and different incentives that might appeal to Netflix. It reportedly wanted Netflix to continue selling subscriptions within its app so it could earn a cut of the money. If Apple was willing to treat Netflix as a special case then, it could do the same now. Google allegedly engaged in the same kind of behavior with Netflix, as lawyers claimed that Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22645974/google-netflix-class-action-antitrust-play-store-commission"&gt;giving Netflix a break&lt;/a&gt; on the standard 30 percent commission it takes out of purchases made through Google Play Billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehaM97"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/netflix-launches-games-on-iphone-ipad-with-apple-payment-system?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Gurman notes that players who launch the Netflix Games apps individually without an account are prompted to sign up for Netflix using Apple’s in-app system. If someone does that, then Apple receives a 30 percent cut of their payments for the first year, then 15 percent of each payment after that. Netflix still doesn’t send new customers through Apple’s payment system in its main app, but this odd arrangement may have been enough to get Netflix Games on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple backs off of breaking Face ID after DIY iPhone 13 screen replacements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V0rR1qwozg8-bZtX-ZEVQyrZl6s=/0x0:2002x1335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117678/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="beNaVw"&gt;Soon after the iPhone 13 launched, repair experts found that swapping out iPhone 13 screens would break Face ID unless you also moved over a tiny control chip from the original screen. It’s a complex process that makes one of the most common types of repairs prohibitively difficult for independent repair shops. (Apple-authorized repair shops, on the other hand, have access to a software tool that can make a phone accept a new screen.) For indie repair shops, things may get easier soon, however, as Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will release a software update that doesn't require you to transfer the microcontroller to keep Face ID working after a screen swap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRdBHh"&gt;The current transfer procedure looks to be quite challenging, requiring time, special equipment, and the ability to microsolder. For many independent repair shops that may rely on screen repairs as a key line of revenue, the process is likely prohibitively difficult and could be damaging to their business. iFixit detailed the situation &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772433%2Fapple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at length&lt;/a&gt; in an article last week, and you can watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MXlhsThmM"&gt;a video of the microcontroller transfer process here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mOwVT"&gt;Apple didn’t specify exactly when the software update will arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
