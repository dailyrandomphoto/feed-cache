    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8N0Nkk"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning a number of updates to its iPad line, including new iPad Pros launching as soon as April, a new iPad mini with a larger screen, and a refresh of the base iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jY2HJg"&gt;The new iPad Pros are expected to have a similar design as the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;released last March&lt;/a&gt; but have a better processor that’s “on par” with the speedy M1 chip in Apple’s newest MacBook Airs, Pros, and Mac mini, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. Both models may also have improved cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlPrXy"&gt;The 12.9-inch iPad Pro could have a Mini LED screen, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, which should offer a higher contrast ratio and be less susceptible to burn-in than OLED screens.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Hours after the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report, reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo added credence to the claim saying Apple would begin mass production of Mini LED iPads in “&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/"&gt;mid to late April&lt;/a&gt;,” as reported by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;. Kuo has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/2/20992125/apple-mini-led-ipad-macbook-pro-2020-oled-rumor-kuo"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has Mini LED-equipped tablets and laptops in the works, and said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s first device with the new screen technology would be a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Kuo’s latest research note issued today said that he expects a Mini LED MacBook Air by 2022 while cheaper iPads, like the iPad Air, will switch to OLED displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJV9Eq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple has tested its new iPad Pros with a Thunderbolt port, which would be able to transfer data faster than the USB-C port found on the iPad Pros right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LmFil"&gt;In addition to the new iPad Pros, Apple is also working on an iPad mini update with a screen that’s larger than the 7.9-inch display currently used on the company’s smallest tablet, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Apple last refreshed the iPad mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after not updating the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/28/9409015/apple-ipad-mini-4-review-2015"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The new iPad mini could launch as soon as this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNFwec"&gt;Apple is also planning to update its cheapest iPad with a new design that’s thinner and lighter at some point this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. Apple last refreshed the base iPad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUSE54"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 5:10AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comments from Ming-Chi Kuo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. If you don’t mind buying refurbished, you can grab a refurbished pair for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the AirPods Pros are currently $219 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37HKT8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K387Y7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, have knocked $30 off its price as well, bringing it down to $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $400 if you buy it in gold&lt;/a&gt; (in stock on March 24th), which is $29 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted at Amazon; you can get this model for $680 ($69 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FTH75?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FVJMX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel puts Apple’s ‘I’m a Mac’ guy into new ads praising PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uLT12mJPm7oEwJ0bBp5O7qEk-1o=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980460/LDTTUmg.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMO1fM"&gt;Intel has hired Apple’s former “I’m a Mac” actor Justin Long to create new ads praising PCs. Long starts each commercial with “Hello I’m a... Justin,” with the typical white background you’d find on Apple’s Mac vs. PC ads from the 2000s. Naturally, the ads focus on Mac vs. PC again, with Long mocking Apple’s Touch Bar, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WfHplU5fatE"&gt;lack of M1 multiple monitor support&lt;/a&gt;, and the “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;gray and grayer&lt;/a&gt;” color choices for a MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0THmCs"&gt;One even &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;goes all-in&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s lack of touchscreens in Macs or 2-in-1 support by mocking the fact you have to buy a tablet, keyboard, stylus, and even a dongle to match what’s available on rival Intel-based laptops. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8HebkohrCns"&gt;Another ad&lt;/a&gt; also points out that “no one really games on a Mac.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PaSRqw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gtRRMd2_UI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X5HdBA"&gt;The return of Justin Long in Mac vs. PC ads for Intel comes just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558977/apple-pc-guy-classic-m1-performance-john-hodgman"&gt;Apple brought back actor John Hodgman&lt;/a&gt; to reprise his role as the PC guy from Apple’s “I’m a Mac, and I’m a PC” ad campaign. While Apple kept its reprisal limited to the company’s keynote to introduce Arm-based M1 MacBooks, Intel has gone a step further and revived this for full commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GidON"&gt;Intel is clearly ready to battle Apple’s first chips with marketing, but we’re still waiting for the company to respond with its own silicon advances. Intel has only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272041/intel-apple-macbook-m1-performance-benchmarks-processors"&gt;produced benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; so far. Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has also already made it clear that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232554/intel-ceo-apple-lifestyle-company-cpus-comment"&gt;Intel has to beat Apple in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just gave Russia a spot on the iPhone to advertise its favorite apps to its citizens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pM2WG3NS0H7dkbe0LJ91Bm-c8cQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68978734/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NkHvcU"&gt;Starting April 1st, users setting up a new iPhone in Russia will see a screen that allows them to automatically install apps that are officially sanctioned by the Russian government, in compliance with Russian law (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-ipad-mac-russia-apps-preinstall-144255015.html"&gt;via Engadget&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptFlOo"&gt;The law in question &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;was passed back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and requires smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and smart TVs sold in Russia to come pre-installed with specific apps made by Russian companies by April 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2021/03/15/861564-iphone-soft"&gt;according to Russian news site &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (The law was originally set to go into effect in July 2020, but was pushed back to April 2021). &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt; also says that apps won’t be installed if users don’t want them. Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will comply with the law by giving the users the option to install the apps when activating the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRBCqS"&gt;Which apps are specifically going to be offered to users remains unclear, though &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt; cites a government services app, and apps from Russian companies including Yandex, Mail.ru, and Kaspersky Lab. The government seems to be aware that it might be problematic to favor specific apps, and is planning to expand its list over time: “The Ministry is not at all interested in seeing popular apps included in the mandatory pre-installation list take dominant positions. If alternatives emerge on the market, prove interesting to users and gain popularity quickly, they will be included in this selection and also offered for pre-installation,” a Russian official told &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DEOsL"&gt;Apple has historically kept tight control over the iPhone’s setup process, and that appears to now be changing, if only in one market. While Apple has previously made changes to stay on the side of local laws — it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985762/apple-maps-weather-apps-crimea-russia-territory"&gt;changed maps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17803638/apple-watch-pride-face-russia-block"&gt;blocked pride watch faces&lt;/a&gt; in Russia, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;now stores iCloud data on state-run servers in China&lt;/a&gt; — this may be one of the more dramatic changes, as it affects a screen that every user will see when they set up their iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOLofx"&gt;Apple has slowly been allowing users to change how iOS works out of the box, with the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21301478/apple-ios-14-default-apps-browser-email-changes-features-report"&gt;change some default apps in iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;, but now it’s given a small amount of control over the setup process to the Russian government, too. As the company faces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;legal challenges from the EU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/17/21292983/apple-spotify-antitrust-hey-email-congress-house-judiciary-tim-cook"&gt;US over antitrust&lt;/a&gt;, and over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;giving its competitors a level playing field&lt;/a&gt;, we may see Apple having to give over some more control to governments if it wants to sell its phones to their citizens — though it probably won’t be compelled to ask users if they want to install Spotify at setup. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;“What’s a computer?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ghkmHd"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656227/apple-ipad-pro-11-12-9-keyboard-test-review-logitech-brydge-zagg-price-specs-features"&gt;a lot of iPad keyboard cases&lt;/a&gt; out there that aim to turn Apple’s tablet into a laptop, but the Kensington StudioDock is something altogether different: it turns your iPad Pro into the world’s tiniest iMac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAAebO"&gt;This is a serious accessory for people who are serious about iPad productivity. (Yes, they exist.) It’s a dock that lets you use your USB-C-equipped iPad Pro or Air in portrait or landscape orientation while giving it a whole lot more connectivity. Basically, if you ever sit down and work at your desk with an iPad Pro, the StudioDock could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHOLt9"&gt;Well, if you’re happy to spend $399, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AHI3wd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10394868"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eECvZe"&gt;The StudioDock is mostly made from aluminum and is sturdy enough that you can adjust the iPad’s position without it moving on your desk, making it easy to switch between portrait and landscape modes or tilt the vertical viewing angle. (An iPad Pro in a StudioDock in portrait mode is a great Zoom device, for example.) The build quality of the stand itself is solid, though the plastic back panel does feel a little low rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4A7BDm"&gt;On one side of the dock you’ll find a USB-C port and a power button, while the other has an SD card slot and a headphone jack. Around back there’s a barrel connector for power, three USB-A ports, an HDMI port, and a Gigabit Ethernet port. There are also two 7.5W Qi wireless chargers integrated into the stand’s base, and (of course) two Kensington security locks. The iPad Pro connects over USB-C and slots onto a magnetic plastic panel that helps support the jack; the dock is available for 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPads, though the size of the magnetic panel is the only thing that’s different between the two versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l90EFQ"&gt;Once your iPad is connected with a keyboard and trackpad or mouse hooked up, it’s like having a little desktop computer with a touchscreen — and way more ports than most Mac laptops these days. It’s really quite adorable, if you find things like the idea of wired internet connectivity on a tablet adorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87CwfWp9cCdOiHKqtXsAOJ8YXpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374202/DSCF7585.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IE7OZS"&gt;Even if you aren’t using a bunch of accessories, the StudioDock is more comfortable to use at a desk than a laptop simply because it raises the display to a better angle. I’m reminded of a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fcover-story%2Fcover-story-2020-12-07&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22333551%2Fkensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; cover&lt;/a&gt; showing a woman at home with her laptop precariously perched on a pile of books. Laptop stands exist, obviously, but not everyone wants to use them, and I like that the StudioDock means you’re not stuck with a redundant keyboard and trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8BXIQ"&gt;A crucial element of this product is that it’s easy enough to move the iPad to and from the dock. It’s still slightly fiddly and in a perfect world I’d want the StudioDock to use the Smart Connector, but since no-one other than Apple and Logitech has ever released products that actually do use it, I assume Kensington had its reasons — bandwidth no doubt among them. One benefit of this design is that it charges the iPad very quickly at 37.5W, so I haven’t had to think about charging it any other way at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9r4I7l"&gt;Kensington also sent an Apple Watch charger that attaches to the USB-C passthrough port. It’ll be sold separately after the StudioDock is released. I found it a little plasticky, like the dock’s back panel, but it worked fine. I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265910/belkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch"&gt;already make use of an Apple Watch desktop charger&lt;/a&gt; every day so I didn’t see much need for this, but if you don’t yet have one then this would be a convenient add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFBgmNRbM6vffKbJp5K7g7YuuRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374205/DSCF7586.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NmSN6a"&gt;The wireless chargers, meanwhile, are also a nice addition. You won’t get the fastest speeds out of them, but the ability to charge a phone and AirPods throughout the day is useful and saves space on your desk compared to separate pads. I did notice a slight coil whine noise when devices were fully charged — this isn’t all that uncommon with wireless chargers, but not all of them do it, so it’s worth noting that this one does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rA7rle"&gt;The StudioDock’s HDMI port supports 4K monitors at 60Hz and should be ideal for iPad dual-display setups, but the software isn’t really there yet on Apple’s part. Only a few apps let you show different content on each monitor — the rest of the time you’re dealing with a pillarboxed mirror of your iPad’s 4:3 screen. (One clever way to get around this is an app called &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shiftscreen/id1498683180?itsct=apps_box&amp;amp;itscg=30200&amp;amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;amp;ct=TheVerge&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;Shiftscreen&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a browser that lets you run up to four web apps across two displays — useful for things like multitasking in Slack and Asana.) I’d personally need iPadOS to get much better external monitor support before I went all-in on an iPad desktop setup, but if you’re used to using a laptop by itself, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro should be big enough for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSp4Yn"&gt;That’s how I used the StudioDock most of the time, and it was generally a great experience. I really like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;trackpad support&lt;/a&gt; that was added to iPadOS last year, and it’s great to be able to combine that with a wired mechanical keyboard and still have a ton of connectivity options. I will just say that I would generally rather use the StudioDock than a laptop balanced on a pile of books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mnf80AHI0WGnv6HvUWzdjaaAKAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374204/DSCF7588.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IxUsrk"&gt;The StudioDock is plainly a niche product, and it does have its quirks. But for the most part, Kensington’s attempt to morph the iPad into a desktop computer actually works. You’d have to be really into the iPad-as-work-machine lifestyle for this to make sense for you, but the StudioDock and iPad Pro combination is a fast, fun computer that does most of what I want it to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvMfxK"&gt;My biggest hangup is the price. It &lt;a href="https://store.kensington.com/products/studiodock%E2%84%A2-ipad-docking-station?utm_source=ktg&amp;amp;utm_medium=landing_page_CTA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ktg_to_store"&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; $399.99 for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro version, or $379.99 for a model that fits the 11-inch iPad Pro and the 10.9-inch iPad Air. That’s clearly a lot of money to invest into a third-party peripheral — it’s more than some iPads cost alone. And I’d worry about whether it’d work with any future iPad Pro designs, considering the current Pros haven’t had a significant update since their introduction in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QBqSRH"&gt;Those are some pretty big caveats, but if you can get over them, the StudioDock is a great way to work on an iPad. It turns the tablet into a more comfortable, capable, and flexible computer, and I just hope Apple’s software evolves to make this kind of use case even better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple discontinues the HomePod, but the HomePod mini will live on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="top of the homepod" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/174-vKAIGR1bUhYwRdDez8RQFhI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68959072/jbareham_180202_2266_0178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dRK1FF"&gt;Apple is discontinuing the original, full-size HomePod and will now focus its speaker efforts on the HomePod mini, the company told &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/?tpcc=ECTW2020&amp;amp;guccounter=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; on Friday evening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ETn8m"&gt;Here is what Apple said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OSuvgh"&gt;HomePod mini has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just $99. We are focusing our efforts on HomePod mini. We are discontinuing the original HomePod, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers. Apple will provide HomePod customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hB7LYG"&gt;The Space Grey model of the full-size HomePod is already sold out on Apple’s online store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTNVVt"&gt;The full-size HomePod had great sound quality, but it was criticized for its high $349 price tag &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker"&gt;at launch&lt;/a&gt;. Apple eventually dropped the price to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295084/apple-homepod-price-cut-299-smart-speaker"&gt;$299 in April 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and came out with the $99 HomePod mini last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hmf5RK"&gt;The move isn’t altogether surprising; sales of the HomePod have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17366778/apple-homepod-sales-estimate-600-thousand-units-smart-speaker"&gt;reportedly been low&lt;/a&gt;, and in our review, we felt that the HomePod mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;offered good sound&lt;/a&gt; for its size.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gC1KwZ"&gt;In 2013, Walt Disney World resort &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3845622/disney-world-magicbands-mymagic-data-gathering"&gt;offered the MagicBands&lt;/a&gt; — a plastic bracelet that made it easy to perform numerous services such as park tickets. And now, almost a decade later, the company is finally making your trip to the most magical place on Earth a little more modern with &lt;a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/03/coming-soon-disney-magicmobile-service-a-convenient-new-way-to-experience-walt-disney-world-resort/"&gt;MagicMobile&lt;/a&gt;, a digital pass accessible through your iPhone and Apple Watch starting later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6nlTg"&gt;As an alternative to spending money on a plastic NFC wristband, the MagicMobile pass will be added to your Apple Wallet. Guests can then use their iPhone or Apple Watch to gain entry into the park. Disney has not said exactly when MagicMobile will officially be available but confirmed Apple devices would get access to the service and features first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwX3sz"&gt;Disney confirmed in &lt;a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/03/coming-soon-disney-magicmobile-service-a-convenient-new-way-to-experience-walt-disney-world-resort/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the MagicBands will still be an option, and guests can choose which option is more convenient for them or even use both and alternate between the MagicBand and MagicMobile pass. (Disney says it’s introducing new MagicBand colors and designs featuring Disney characters.) The company also notes that MagicMobile will not replace the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fplan%2Fmy-disney-experience%2F%3FCMP%3DILC-DPFY21Q2wo0311210317210005C&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F12%2F22327351%2Fdisney-magicmobile-pass-announced-iphone-apple-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My Disney Experience app&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a digital room key for guests staying at a Disney Resort hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple sues 11-year veteran MacBook designer for allegedly stealing trade secrets for a journalist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fA86QY2DKSwH07ZT7beT5FHyO3Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950940/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8u8rBK"&gt;Apple is suing Simon Lancaster, a former product design architect at the company, accusing him of selling trade secrets and details on unreleased Apple products to an unnamed media correspondent. Lancaster apparently did this in hopes of gaining publicity for his next venture after leaving Apple. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/11/apple-sues-former-employee-over-device-leaks-to-media"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported on the legal filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03nWQN"&gt;“Tens of thousands of Apple employees work tirelessly every day on new products, services and features in the hopes of delighting our customers and empowering them to change the world. Stealing ideas and confidential information undermines their efforts, hurting Apple and our customers,” commented Apple in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We take very seriously this individual’s deliberate theft of our trade secrets, violation of our ethics and our policies, all for personal gain. We will do all we can to protect the innovations we hold so dear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbXqLk"&gt;According to Apple’s suit, Lancaster and his correspondent began communicating in 2018 about the possibility of obtaining information; the two then spent the next year in communication. Lancaster then reportedly contacted his correspondent in spring 2019, asking him to investigate rumors of a potential Apple product that could “mean trouble for my startup.” The lawsuit also claims that Lancaster boasted to a third party shortly after that conversation that his media contact would be writing a story on his startup if it hit $1 million in funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpnIE4"&gt;In October 2019, Lancaster reportedly notified his correspondent that he was planning to leave Apple, giving over secret information on Apple products and asking if they wanted “to write a story about a 12-year Apple Design Veteran leaving for an amazing startup?” The correspondent also allegedly asked Lancaster to get additional information on an unannounced project that Apple refers to as “Project X.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ0Uz1"&gt;Lancaster then submitted his notice of resignation to Apple on October 15th, but kept chatting with his media source — the next day, they allegedly asked for specific documents they wanted Lancaster to get before he left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDRJhH"&gt;Apple also alleges that Lancaster specifically attended a meeting about “Project X” even after he had submitted his resignation notice, specifically to get more information to pass along to his media contact, despite the fact that he had been instructed by other employees not to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSZRmH"&gt;The company also claims that Lancaster used his Apple credentials to download confidential information almost up until his employment ended at midnight on November 1st, 2019. According to Apple, Lancaster logged in from an external location at 10:24PM that day — this time, to get materials that the company says would help his new employer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARMU4S"&gt;Lancaster &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fwhy-i-left-apple-joined-arris-composites-simon-lancaster-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325827%2Fapple-lawsuit-macbook-designer-simon-lancaster-trade-secrets-leaks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;started working at Apple in 2008&lt;/a&gt; and spent 11 years working at the company, serving as advanced materials lead and product design architect in his final role there &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fwhy-i-left-apple-joined-arris-composites-simon-lancaster-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325827%2Fapple-lawsuit-macbook-designer-simon-lancaster-trade-secrets-leaks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;before leaving in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to join Arris Composites, a material design company, as its head of consumer products. &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191122005108/en/Simon-Lancaster-Former-Advanced-Materials-Lead-at-Apple-Joins-Arris-Composites-to-Unlock-Future-of-Consumer-Products"&gt;According to a press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing his switch to Arris, Lancaster worked on the 13-inch and 15-inch Macbook Pro with Touch Bar redesigns, along with “unreleased Apple products.” &lt;/p&gt;
