    <title>Apple scrubs controversial CSAM detection feature from webpage but says plans haven’t changed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="08LtgO"&gt;Apple has updated a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;webpage on its child safety features&lt;/a&gt; to remove all references to the controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611305/apple-scan-photos-iphones-icloud-child-abuse-imagery-neuralmatch"&gt;first announced in August&lt;/a&gt;. The change, which was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/apple-nixes-csam-references-website/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, appears to have taken place some time &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211210163051/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;between December 10th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211213213636/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;December 13th&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the change to its website, the company says its plans for the feature haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkMs8A"&gt;Two of the three safety features, which released earlier this week with iOS 15.2, are still present on the page, which is titled “Expanded Protections for Children.” However references to the more controversial CSAM detection, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;launch was delayed&lt;/a&gt; following backlash from privacy advocates, have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7KASm"&gt;When reached for comment, Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer said that the company’s position hasn’t changed since September, when it first announced it would be delaying the launch of the CSAM detection. “Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers, and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features,” the company’s September statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWxRtC"&gt;Crucially, Apple’s statement does not say the feature has been canceled entirely. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf"&gt;Documents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"&gt;outlining&lt;/a&gt; how the functionality works are still live on Apple’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x2oxlg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7BX0L3"&gt;Apple’s CSAM detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;was controversial&lt;/a&gt; when it was announced because it involves taking hashes of iCloud Photos and comparing them to a database of hashes of known child sexual abuse imagery. Apple claims this approach allows it to report users to the authorities if they’re known to be uploading child abuse imagery without compromising the privacy of its customers more generally. It also says the encryption of user data is not affected and that the analysis be run on-device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9fFJg"&gt;But critics argue that Apple’s system risks undermining Apple’s end-to-end encryption. Some referred to the system as a “backdoor” that governments around the world might strong-arm Apple into expanding into including content beyond CSAM. For its part, Apple has said that it will “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;not accede to any government’s request to expand it&lt;/a&gt;” beyond CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dcz1P8"&gt;While the CSAM detection feature has yet to receive a new launch date, Apple has gone on to release two of the other child-protection features it announced in August. One is designed to warn children when they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;receive images containing nudity in Messages&lt;/a&gt;, while the second provides additional information when searching for terms related to child exploitation through Siri, Spotlight, or Safari Search. Both rolled out with iOS 15.2, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;released earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; and which appears to have prompted Apple to update its webpage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe brings two more desktop tools to Photoshop on iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpApUXWY0MjymkbAmWE3Ov0u8aE=/59x0:1607x1032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270870/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_2.32.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8QGix"&gt;&lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/whats-new/mobile-2022-1.html"&gt;Adobe has updated Photoshop for the iPad&lt;/a&gt; with two crucial new tools — the smudge and sponge tools, which have been mainstays on the desktop version of the app but absent on mobile until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fbG1H"&gt;The smudge tool (as the name suggests) is used to help blur and blend lines or colors together and comes with the usual settings for adjusting size and strength of the effect, along with a variety of modes (including normal, darken, lighten, hue, saturation, color, and luminosity). The sponge tool, on the other hand, works to help retouch images by saturating or desaturating color, allowing users to fine-tune how vibrant their images and art look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DjKsJrK9ogKA23FoYIW2adXEQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087711/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_2.34.54_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="12RbGa"&gt;Additionally, Adobe also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/whats-new.html"&gt;new update for Premiere Pro on desktop&lt;/a&gt;, adding key performance improvements for M1-powered Macs. With the new update, all M1 Macs now work with hardware-accelerated exports for DCI 4K and 8K HEVC formats, which Adobe says will result in “significantly faster performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2H3C7"&gt;Additionally, Adobe is also offering hardware acceleration for ProRes videos on the M1 Max and M1 Pro chips in the latest MacBook Pro laptops, offering up to five times faster performance. Windows users with integrated Intel GPUs are also getting a boost, with improvements to video playback, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJva5p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is requiring masks again at all US retail stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFTDMXcCnSWV9xPeXmYwluX9qjk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270378/acastro_190530_1777_wwdc_2019_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sOfkHh"&gt;Apple is again requiring customers to wear masks in all its US retail stores after it had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1470808052186161155"&gt;reportedly rolled back the mandate for around half of its locations&lt;/a&gt;. In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; the company said that “amid rising cases in many communities, we now require that all customers join our team members in wearing masks while visiting our stores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOqYlz"&gt;While employees have been required to wear masks throughout most of the pandemic, customers haven’t always had to, which has led to outbreaks at some Apple stores. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1470808052186161155"&gt;also reports&lt;/a&gt; that some locations will have occupancy limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B5IAIK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple reportedly started dropping mask mandates for some stores in November&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g8jhBI"&gt;Apple’s current mask policy was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763958/apple-mask-requirements-retail-store-customers-coronavirus"&gt;reportedly enacted in early November&lt;/a&gt; when some retail stores dropped the requirement following increased vaccination rates and decreased infection rates. This cycle seems to be a repeat of what happened this summer — Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;started relaxing mask requirements&lt;/a&gt; for some stores in June but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598686/apple-retail-stores-mask-mandate-requirement"&gt;brought them back&lt;/a&gt; at most locations in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdyi7h"&gt;Apple is reinstating these requirements as the number of COVID infections in the US is again on the rise, even as booster shots start to become widely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i65K1T"&gt;This change also comes after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;widespread outbreak was reported at an Apple store&lt;/a&gt; in Southlake, Texas, earlier this month. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-store-texas-closes-covid-outbreak-rcna8000"&gt;According to NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, 22 employees at the location tested positive for COVID following Black Friday, where some staff reported that customers (who were not required to wear masks) were packed into the store “shoulder to shoulder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ljTxM"&gt;Apple also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures in stores to support the wellbeing of customers and employees.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the iPhone’s new App Privacy Report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i6oUxAjmsCkK_KjPTdkuTVnGPHU=/0x0:828x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269752/IMG_F070E3C6CB84_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vk9q6w"&gt;Information is power, and if you’re an iPhone user, you can now get more information about how often your apps access your data (for example, your location or your microphone). The App Privacy Report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;which became available with iOS 15.2&lt;/a&gt;, also lets you know each app’s web activity and what domains they attach to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDSraO"&gt;The feature is off by default, but if your phone has updated to iOS 15.2, it’s very simple to turn on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2r1zTG"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; App Privacy Report (which will be at the bottom of the screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Y0O6T"&gt;Select “Turn On App Privacy Report”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select App Privacy Report at the bottom of the Privacy screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKPTeO3dThT9NxG1w_fPngDa7b0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087106/IMG_653BB478D14B_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select App Privacy Report at the bottom of the Privacy screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Just turn on the App Privacy Report — and wait." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6utjPixE2dw2VdXXtsROd6Zt7lw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087084/IMG_83D5CB8F00B6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just turn on the App Privacy Report — and wait.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4GD0oA"&gt;After that, you can follow the same series of selections to see your report. (You can also use &lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/71047d5a577b488397247b7a1081e0fd"&gt;this Shortcut&lt;/a&gt; for quicker access right from your home screen or a Siri voice command.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsjoYu"&gt;You won’t immediately see any data — it takes time for your phone to collect the data and assemble the report, but you can start to see results in just a few minutes. The report will let you know the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="IrZ5Yz"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Which apps accessed your data within the last seven days.&lt;/strong&gt; If you tap on one of the apps listed, you will be able to see exactly when the last accesses were. You will probably have to drill down a couple of pages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Privacy Report will give you data on what your apps are accessing." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4xNc2Vp6I4pxQCM1BlxqR_7fS8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087108/IMG_F070E3C6CB84_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Privacy Report will give you data on what your apps are accessing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on an app and you can see when it last accessed your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ox00JIa17EWKJx5AKgAOa1bOlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087111/IMG_181DDC094B17_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on an app and you can see when it last accessed your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Sp65IE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;App network activity. &lt;/strong&gt;Tap on the app, and you’ll see which domains were contacted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also see each app’s network activity." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4l7DL436Jyor214oGIe3bVPe-G0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087117/IMG_0AF9F1551C66_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also see each app’s network activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on the network in turn, and see if other apps have used it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dn5JKrw-M24SXjPt7SB9SVfHd1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087118/IMG_B05CA8F67FC8_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on the network in turn, and see if other apps have used it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="iNfXMX"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Most contacted domains. &lt;/strong&gt;Tap on each domain name, and you’ll get a list of which apps contacted that domain and when.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also see your most contacted domains." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UAr-3N6O08lbr5v7IS9zFxhGd3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087122/IMG_6E972B7C16D5_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also see your most contacted domains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="And see how many apps have used that domain." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-M0rHFaLBqXpWdhe-luV5YG4B_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087126/IMG_0CE479E3E4E8_1.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ce3Zyy"&gt;If for any reason you want to turn off the App Privacy Report, just go back to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Privacy Report and select “Turn Off App Privacy Report” at the bottom of the page. Be aware, however, that you will lose any existing information that you’ve collected up until then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2NflV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7Y80k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;We saw some of the best iPad deals of the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but if you missed out, there are still a couple of decent discounts available. Whether you’re after the high-end iPad Pro or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ehglg9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model, if you can even find it. As a result, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant is $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestiPadDealsDecember&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F674982024&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have previously discounted both Wi-Fi models of the new iPad by $30, which is the steepest discount we’ve seen yet. While Walmart’s listing with that price is still up, the deal appears to have sold out, and other retailers aren’t currently offering comparable sales. If you’re looking for a deal, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling the new 256GB variant with six-month subscriptions to both Apple Music and Apple News Plus. Note that these freebies are only available to new subscribers, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"},{"title":"Apple says the iPad Mini’s jelly scrolling isn’t a problem that needs to be fixed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698590/apple-ipad-mini-jelly-scroll-issue-response-fix-lcd-technology"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KUcr6D"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 has the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations but with refreshed internal specs. It could be a good choice for fans of the classic home button, Touch ID, and a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;We’ve seen the outgoing 64GB iPad Mini with its older A12 Bionic processor drop to as low as $299, and the 256GB model was recently on sale for $495 instead of $550. At the moment, however, we’re not seeing any discounts on the older iPad Mini. Many retailers have discontinued selling the last-gen model, and even refurbished versions are becoming more difficult to find. If you have your eyes set exclusively on the 2019 model, however, Apple is currently selling a refurbished, Wi-Fi-equipped model with 256GB of storage in rose gold for &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1186596/7613?subId1=TheVergeiPadDealRoundup121321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFUQY2LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-iPad-mini-5-Wi-Fi-64GB-Gold" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$469&lt;/a&gt; instead of $549.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6tfbCt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sixth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen, a top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has sadly forfeited its headphone jack in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;Right now, there are no discounts to be had on the sixth-gen Mini. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, however, will throw in six months of Apple Music and Apple News Plus — as well as three months of Apple TV Plus —when you purchase the iPad Mini at full price, assuming you’re a new subscriber. If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at around $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2yrbb"&gt;We’ve previously seen the base model drop to as low as $489. While it’s currently not available for that cheap, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B08J6FD94H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wi-Fi-equipped model with 64GB of storage in green for $569.98&lt;/a&gt;, a modest 5 percent off the typical list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike some of the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance but only if you’re interested in buying the massive 1TB variant. Right now, Best Buy is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcpPjgDOGe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB, Wi-Fi-equipped variant&lt;/a&gt; for $1,099.99 instead of $1,299.99. Additionally, Best Buy will throw in a six-month subscription to Apple News Plus and Apple Music, if you’re a new subscriber, as well as three months of Apple TV Plus. If you prefer the 12.9-inch, 256GB model with Wi-Fi, it’s currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for $929 instead of $1,099.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi starts at $799. While we’ve previously seen the price of this model drop to as low as $649.97, right now Amazon is only selling it in silver for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B0932B5NVD?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749&lt;/a&gt;, which is a modest $50 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhnrgA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10840379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;Meanwhile, the 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon in either silver or gray for $999&lt;/a&gt;, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date. The silver configuration is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also available for the same price at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, where you can also snag the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F385211636%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $1,099&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPaoS2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="vdWMel"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iuddo9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SharePlay is now available on Macs as part of the latest macOS Monterey update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-VtpFJH48wkOgRJHiBnaNot5ctU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267350/akrales_211028_4820_0680.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a8AOYW"&gt;Apple has brought SharePlay to the Mac as part of macOS Monterey 12.1, which was released Monday. With SharePlay, you can now enjoy entertainment like movies, music, and games synchronized with your friends over FaceTime while on your Mac. (You can see a list of &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1583059388"&gt;some supported apps here&lt;/a&gt;.) And if you want to share your screen with your group, SharePlay supports that as well. My colleague Monica Chin ran &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;into some issues&lt;/a&gt; with SharePlay on Mac while the feature was in beta, however, so hopefully it works more smoothly now that it’s available widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rvlAc"&gt;macOS Monterey 12.1 adds some features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;also found in iOS 15.2&lt;/a&gt;. There’s the new Apple Music Voice Plan, a more affordable tier of the music streaming service that lets you access music with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734185/new-apple-music-voice-plan-price-features-app"&gt;just your voice and Siri&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to designate people as Legacy Contacts who can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;access your iCloud data when you die&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple will now let parents enable warnings that appear when their children receive or send iMessages with nude photos.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLznrt"&gt;The new version of Monterey is still missing one big feature, though. Universal Control, which lets you use one mouse and keyboard across Macs and iPads, was supposed to launch this fall, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832765/universal-control-apple-macos-monterey-ipad-delay-spring"&gt;Apple delayed it Monday to “this spring.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJhPzE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The MacBook Air with M1 processor is back down to $800 for today only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vO1qpXj53nwSXQfxIsb8Wy2UZZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266487/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Air with M1 processor first debuted just over one year ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ak2488"&gt;The MacBook Air with M1 processor, our top pick for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;the best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, is currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcsdQZjSND" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 off at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This brings the popular laptop from Apple down to its historical low price of $799.99. We have often seen this MacBook Air discounted by $50, $100, and even occasionally $150, but this level of sale is much less frequent, and as good as it gets. Best Buy’s deal on the MacBook Air is only running for today — scheduled to expire when it strikes midnight on December 14th — or while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuNF5X"&gt;The configuration of MacBook Air on offer today is the late 2020 model with the Apple-made M1 CPU, outfitted with the base-level 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM. You have your choice of colors from its three options of space gray, gold, and silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOfFBV"&gt;There are few other laptops as capable in this price range as the MacBook Air, whether you’re dabbling in productivity and work, everyday home and on-the-go computer use, or even light content creation. Its battery life is also exceptional. The biggest knock against this laptop — dongle life aside — is the awful webcam quality. Though there are worse problems to have, especially if you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;put some of that money saved toward a webcam&lt;/a&gt; that is much better than the cameras built into any laptop. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal Control won’t be coming to macOS Monterey until sometime this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8T_kPXe_J0aSmUGfYN4cUfZWmvc=/0x8:1630x1095/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266227/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_7.37.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vpqLBu"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;Universal Control feature&lt;/a&gt; has been delayed again, with the company’s website updating today to note that the drag-and-drop feature won’t be arriving until sometime “this spring,” as spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSWUpdates/status/1470468525613539334"&gt;the AppleSWUpdates Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIpYIX"&gt;Universal Control was originally announced alongside macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15 at WWDC back in June, but the feature — which promises to bridge Apple’s Mac and iPad devices, allowing users to use a single mouse and keyboard for both and to drag and drop content between the two — has yet to materialize in either macOS or iPadOS. Apple hasn’t even started offering Universal Control to developers or beta users to test yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kNcuje"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Universal Control on macOS Monterey works","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Nh2JJn"&gt;Apple had previously updated its website in October to indicate that Universal Control &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733044/macos-universal-control-later-this-fall-monterey-feature-delay"&gt;would be available “later this fall,”&lt;/a&gt; but with the official end of fall just a few days away, it seems that the company is no longer going to hit that estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1oyk3J9lwYF7uL2j0OVs-ksrusQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085160/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_2.14.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mLD03M"&gt;Universal Control isn’t the only major feature to have missed the initial release for Apple’s 2021 software updates. SharePlay, one of the company’s marquee software features this year, wasn’t available at the launch of either iOS 15 or macOS Monterey (the feature only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;arrived on iOS on October 25th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-macos-monterey-12-1/"&gt;just hit macOS today&lt;/a&gt;), while other more minor features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;also failed to make the cut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 15.2 with App Privacy Report, Digital Legacy, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r63_BgzBE2ppZdSgP2zSzs7Vwfk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265497/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should now be able to download iOS 15.2&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjCL3h"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15.2, which includes a ton of features and fixes, has started to become roll out to iPhones after an extensive beta period. According to Apple’s release notes, posted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2-watchos-8-3-and-tvos-15-2-to-all-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the update includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="txvrW9"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;The Digital Legacy program&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22812264/digital-legacy-death-estate-google-apple-how-to"&gt;designate who gets access to your data&lt;/a&gt; when you die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1i2stA"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;The App Privacy Report&lt;/a&gt;, which shows what permissions your apps use, and what websites they connect to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TqxDX0"&gt;Apple’s $4.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822631/apple-music-voice-plan-ios-15-2-release-candidate"&gt;voice-only plan for Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Jr09g"&gt;A fix for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;somewhat confusing state of the 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2XMGjZ"&gt;The update also brings with it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;some of Apple’s communication safety features&lt;/a&gt;, one of which will blur iMessages sent to children that an on-device scan tags as potentially being explicit. The feature was part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;Apple’s controversial suite of changes&lt;/a&gt; meant to fight child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which involved on-device scanning of photos uploaded to iCloud, as well as automatically notifying parents if their child chose to view pictures tagged as inappropriate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ItxICe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kb2zI4"&gt;Apple has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delayed the photo library scanning feature&lt;/a&gt; and has made it so that children get to choose whether to notify their parents. iOS 15.2 also brings changes to Safari and Siri that will redirect users to resources if they search for topics related to CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpg3CG"&gt;The update also includes Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824733/apple-iphone-part-service-history-ios-15-2"&gt;new parts and service history feature&lt;/a&gt;, which can show you which parts on your device have been replaced and whether the job was done using genuine Apple parts. Apple says that the iPhone XR, XS, and SE second-gen will show if your battery was replaced and that the iPhone 11 and up will also show if your display has been replaced. The iPhone 12 and 13 models will be able to show info about camera replacements as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsjGrg"&gt;The repair history will show up in Settings &amp;gt; General  &amp;gt; About, under the name and software version section. If you haven’t replaced the battery, screen, or camera on your phone, it won’t show up, according to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212878"&gt;Apple’s support document&lt;/a&gt; for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCRjka"&gt;To download iOS 15.2, go to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update. As usual, it can take a moment to roll out to everyone, so if you don’t see it you may want to check back in after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qY1oWF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 13th, 3:04PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added info about repair history info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases Android app to help find sneaky AirTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KY4BEXF4EvnZH2A-B3nMIj0kPB0=/0x56:566x433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265952/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_11.13.48.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tracker Detect works on Android 9 and above.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hnHV3z"&gt;Apple has released an app called Tracker Detect, which the company says will let Android users search for AirTags or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;other Find My-compatible trackers&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Chipolo One Spot tracking tag (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-launches-airtags-and-find-my-detector-app-for-android-in-effort-to-boost-privacy/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the app, it looks for devices that have been separated from their owners — if it finds any, it will let you play a sound on it so you can locate it, and it will give you instructions on how to figure out who the AirTag belongs to and how to disable it if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drdQju"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516178/apple-airtags-tracking-devices-update-play-sound-privacy-android-app"&gt;announced that this app was coming in June&lt;/a&gt;, promising that it would allow Android users to find potentially malicious trackers being used without their knowledge. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;Unlike on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, though, it doesn’t seem like this app will constantly do scans in the background and alert you if something is up — it’s purely a manual search. Tracker Detect also doesn’t help you keep track of the AirTags attached to an Apple account, so it’s not helping Android users actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; AirTags.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YdF_fcB-zP5g6_1OrmVltlHAPow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085120/Screenshot_20211213_133032.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can run a manual scan with Tracker Detect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zFc8wj"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that the app “gives Android users the ability to scan for an AirTag or supported Find My enabled item trackers that might be traveling with them without their knowledge. We are raising the bar on privacy for our users and the industry, and hope others will follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhVEWl"&gt;For at least two &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers, Tracker Detect didn’t show up in a Play Store search on our devices. However, you can install it by &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect"&gt;following this link to its store page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
