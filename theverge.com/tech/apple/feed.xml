    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="B1aeyk"&gt;Buying a smartphone for under $500 is a lesson in setting priorities. It’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point, but luckily you will be able to buy a great phone that does the things that matter the most to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qMTFV"&gt;Phones at this price point are better than ever, many coming with features that used to be reserved just for flagships. But instead of getting it all, you should think about the features that you care about and focus on finding a phone that nails them. Some phones emphasize a big screen, others a quality camera, and one of them emphasizes speed and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opZnVh"&gt;The trend of inexpensive phones getting better has been happening for a few years now, with companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung making devices that absolutely can meet your needs for less. Other companies like TCL have started trying to build their own brand by marketing directly, and OnePlus is also making a return to the lower end of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O271rc"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the Apple iPhone SE. It serves the needs of most people and does a competent job at everything, but its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77wmze"&gt;If you prefer an Android phone or are looking to spend less, then the options start to bifurcate a little bit. The Google Pixel 4A has an excellent camera and good software, but it doesn’t have the large screen many people are looking for. To get that, your best bet is Samsung’s Galaxy A51 smartphone, which does boast a big, beautiful screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAV1gP"&gt;Those phones are pretty much available worldwide, but if you’re in the markets where OnePlus has more presence, the OnePlus Nord is a newcomer that beats out the competition by hitting a higher baseline in all its categories rather than excelling at just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejzg03"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a flagship: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight As in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xGSQd4"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Specifically, we recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yS33o"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJSrTq"&gt;But in exchange for that very familiar phone body, you get a lot of value. The best thing about the iPhone SE is its processor, Apple’s A13 Bionic. That matters because it is literally the fastest processor you can get on any phone, anywhere. It’s the exact same chip found in Apple’s $999-and-up iPhone 11 Pro. Normally speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFxDqg"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means that in a few years the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XX01cV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yPInwx"&gt;Battery life is good, but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, a relative rarity at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape of the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8 there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbhSVu"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2020 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEIcsk"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four, five, or even six years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s clean iOS software, and huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGMHIJ_EFkQE2rMcf3ISzHc3EYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691927/vpavic_4113_20200721_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lIP45s"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PmYbc8"&gt;The best inexpensive Android phone with the best camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ea8Tfu"&gt;If you prefer Android, want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxMxyh"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means that the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMP3dB"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgAIi6"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it. That puts you first in line for Android updates and also guarantees you’ll get them for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EQNFx"&gt;Unfortunately, in three years, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be on its last legs. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbtrpB"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord has very good specs for its price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uLYmxs"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US right now. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jllZvZ"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high-refresh-rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMIHtL"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is solid, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzsRwZ"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQiNib"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t support the right LTE bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OMhBq9"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy A51 has a huge screen and is otherwise a pretty decent phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6gGzxS0kO-_Qkwy_XyWUOyb1Jo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19951824/vpavic_052004_4007_0022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A51 has a huge screen and is otherwise a pretty decent phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHeLLf"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A51&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="n49IDp"&gt;The best phone if you want a big screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9zHmts"&gt;Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 Android phone may well turn out to be the bestselling phone of 2020. Its predecessor, the Galaxy A50, outshone all expectations. For the A51, Samsung focused on nailing a big screen, good battery life, and the camera. It got the screen just right; the other two are just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCBvU5"&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED display on the A51 is bright and vivid, and you’d have to be pretty persnickety to find fault in it. It doesn’t offer the same high refresh rate you can get on the OnePlus Nord, but it makes up for that with Samsung’s great quality. If there’s one weird thing about the screen, it’s that Samsung put a chrome bezel around the hole punch for the front-facing selfie camera. It’s distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BPSfp"&gt;The A51 sports nice build quality, though you can definitely feel that it’s plastic on the back. It has a headphone jack and 128GB of storage, which is the number you should be aiming for on any phone these days. Battery life should be superb thanks to a 4,000mAh battery, but because it has to power that big screen, it nets out to being just so-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReiNOy"&gt;As is becoming a (weird) standard on this class of phone, the A51 has a regular wide angle, an ultrawide, a depth sensor, and a macro camera. And as is also standard, the regular wide angle will get you the best images. The A51 can’t beat the Pixel 4A for quality, but the different lens options might be more fun for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ot0H0"&gt;Samsung recently committed to providing the A51 with three generations of Android software updates, which is great news. Less great is that it usually takes Samsung longer than you’d like to get software updates out to the A-line of phones. Samsung has also started to junk up its previously elegant OneUI software interface with ads and other junkware, so be prepared to do some cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZjXl5"&gt;On the whole, though, what the A51 gets you is a very big, very beautiful screen. If that’s your highest priority — and for many people, it is — the A51 is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You probably don’t need 5G yet, but the Google Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARB606"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L6XTYh"&gt;If you really think you need 5G&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WqKDDc"&gt;If you live in the US, chances are the 5G networks in your area are not going to live up to the high-flying promises carriers have been making. But if you really do think you’d benefit from 5G, the best phone under $500 that supports it is Google’s Pixel 4A 5G. At $499, it comes in just under the wire on our price limit — but the Verizon version costs an extra $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbBb7l"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G is good for all the reasons that the Pixel 4A is good: it has a great still camera, solid battery life, and clean Google software. It has some other benefits, though. It uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor, which means it’s faster than the Pixel 4A and nearly all the rest of the sub-$500 Android phones you can find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W2PnU"&gt;It also has a larger screen, clocking in at 6.2 inches diagonally. It doesn’t feel too gigantic when you hold it, but you can tell it’s a larger phone. Google chose this size not to give you that bigger screen, but because it needed the extra space to hold all the components and antennas required for 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m13wf6"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G has a slightly better camera system compared to the Pixel 4A, thanks to the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor. Google has also made its excellent Night Sight mode automatic and improved video with some new stabilization modes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajp1K5"&gt;Otherwise, it follows the standard low-cost Pixel formula. It has a plastic back with fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack. Google doesn’t load down the software with extra crapware you don’t want, but it does include some nice little Google touches like a voice recorder that automatically creates a transcription as it records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K241jf"&gt;Someday, not having 5G will be a serious downside for smartphones, but right now those networks still need to be built out a little bit more. Even if you ignore the potentially faster network speeds, the Pixel 4A 5G is a surprisingly great phone. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Power has incredible battery life, but the rest of it isn’t so incredible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pxVQdv"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pn815f"&gt;The phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uP3407"&gt;Motorola makes a pair of phones that are siblings: the G Stylus and the G Power. The difference between them is right there in the names: the G Stylus comes with a stylus and the G Power has a larger battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3BFGL"&gt;We prefer the G Power because a 5,000mAh battery on a $249 phone is a shockingly good deal. You will, of course, notice a bunch of other compromises in exchange for that huge battery, but if you definitely need a phone that will last, the G Power is your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pvfy9"&gt;The G Power has a 6.4-inch FHD+ display which looks decent, but it unfortunately only has 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. You’ll get by on both, but you’ll run into hassles just a bit more quickly than on phones with more. The processor is a Snapdragon 665, which will be enough to run whatever app you want, it just won’t launch it quickly and overall the phone may feel too slow in two or three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDBZ93"&gt;As for cameras, the G Power keeps the trend of a main sensor, an ultrawide, and a macro on the back. The main sensor is 16 megapixels and performs much better than the $250 price would lead you to expect. If you’ve used inexpensive Motorola phones before, you’ll likely find that the G Power offers a big step up in picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHrfLr"&gt;If you’re very confident you want a stylus, your best bet is to see if you can find a refurbished or gently used Samsung Galaxy Note. It does a much better job providing a software ecosystem of compatible apps for its stylus. If you can’t, the G Stylus pretty much matches what we’ve said about the G Power, just with less battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL is trying hard to break into the US market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FvN09U"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;TCL 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aQnAQL"&gt;The phone that looks professional&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="woKhbI"&gt;TCL is probably best known for its televisions, but it has served as the white label manufacturer for smartphones for many years. Now, it’s trying to make a name for itself in smartphones with new, low-cost options like the TCL 10L and the TCL 10 Pro. The Pro is the upgrade pick and retails for $449.90, though you can often find it on sale for less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnR7sq"&gt;The 10 Pro looks like it means business. Instead of iridescent colors and big camera bumps, it’s thin, flat, and gray. It has a 6.47-inch display, but overall feels smaller than some phones on this list. You also get a headphone jack and a big, 4,500mAh battery that should get you through a full day without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikA6Gl"&gt;The best spec on the 10 Po is its 6GB of RAM, which is plenty for multitasking and should keep your most recent apps from shutting down in the background. There’s the appropriate 128GB of storage, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uQsKq"&gt;The 10 Pro’s understated looks also extend to the Android software, which has a few extra little features but generally tends to stay out of your way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6q4BYj"&gt;As for cameras, they’re somewhat uninspiring: there’s a 64-megapixel main sensor, a 16-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel macro. The photos you’ll get have that over-processed look that sometimes makes images look artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OWbWI"&gt;Overall, the best thing about the TCL 10 Pro is that it has plenty of RAM for multitasking and a thin shape that isn’t bombastic. If you can find a good deal on one, it’s worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SqJJAi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556659"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9yLHtZ"&gt;Whether you’re shopping for a student, an older relative, or anyone in between, a laptop can make a great gift. And the internet’s largest retailers are offering all kinds of laptops at discounted prices this Black Friday, whether you’re looking for a convertible, a Chromebook, a gaming rig, or anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8Tv9N"&gt;Note that for some models, only certain configurations may be on sale. Make sure to double-check the specs of the item you’re buying to make sure they’ll suit your workload (and that you’re actually getting the discount) before you check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vRrnV"&gt;To learn more about some of these laptops, and others that may see discounts later this week, check out our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops of 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dpI62t"&gt;HP deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jIzyzH"&gt;A number of HP laptops are on sale through Best Buy’s online store. One of them is the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724673736170934495" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Envy x360 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;, a portable convertible laptop that offers exceptional value for its price. We reviewed an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AMD configuration&lt;/a&gt;, and were quite impressed with the keyboard and build quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iAfDaD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9624369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="78uaqZ"&gt;If you’re looking for something more upscale, you can snag $500 off an HP Spectre x360 15 2-in-1. Originally priced at $1,599.99, the Spectre is a powerful convertible with a 4K touchscreen and a discrete GPU. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These are the best Black Friday streaming deals for Hulu, Spotify, Sling TV, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6pLUS8Wza3qKSGbFT80mzPOXby0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67933948/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uL0o36"&gt;Ready to re-up your Netflix subscription for another year? What about Spotify or Apple Music? Black Friday and Cyber Monday can be the perfect opportunity to lock in your streaming services for less money than they’d usually cost. Whether you’re after music, live TV streaming, or something more niche, there are a host of offers and limited-time deals to choose between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwkXb7"&gt;Once you’re done scoping out the streaming offers, check out our big roundup of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;the best Black Friday deals you can get right now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5Nikh8"&gt;Get Hulu for $1.99 per month for the next year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d1nRWO"&gt;Hulu’s hard-to-resist Black Friday promotion is back for another year. It lets you subscribe to the standard (with ads) plan for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=763711.10&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1.99 monthly instead of the regular $5.99 rate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZbH8H"&gt;Here’s the fine print: this offer is only available for new and returning customers — and to qualify for the latter, you must have canceled the service at least three months ago. Anyone who took advantage of last year’s $1.99 promo is ineligible this time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5MtSU"&gt;The Hulu deal will be available starting at 12AM PT / 3AM ET on Thursday and will run until 11:59PM PT on Monday night (2:59AM ET Tuesday). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MDWN3z"&gt;Sign up for Sling TV, and get your second month for free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pvOiY5"&gt;New customers subscribing to live TV streaming service Sling TV &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sling.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will get their second month of Sling Blue or Sling Orange (a $30 value) for free&lt;/a&gt; as part of the company’s holiday offer. If you prepay for two months of service, you can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sling.com/pm/tivo?AID=12103878" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get a free TiVo Stream 4K&lt;/a&gt;, which is a perfectly decent Android TV streaming dongle. Sling TV is also offering a three-day free trial of the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ksXZ9A"&gt;Get four months of Tidal for 99 cents or $1.99 for Hi-Fi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XsAeBH"&gt;Tidal’s annual subscription discount is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2Fblackfriday&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21603508%2Fblack-friday-streaming-deals-tv-movies-subscription-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available starting on November 24th&lt;/a&gt; through December 2nd. Those who take advantage can get four months of standard Tidal Premium for 99 cents; you can also opt for the lossless HiFi service tier for $1.99. Tidal says this is a value of $39.96 (Premium) and $79.96 (HiFi). After the promotional period, you’ll be on the hook for the standard going rate of $9.99 / month for Tidal Premium or $19.99 / month for HiFi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IGhGjE"&gt;YouTube TV now comes with a free Chromecast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eseZWM"&gt;If you’ve never tried YouTube’s streaming TV service, you can now &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/"&gt;get a free Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt; (a value of $49.99) once you sign up. The rising cost of YouTube TV is frustrating, but at least now you get a complimentary gadget with your first $64.99 bill. To get the free Chromecast, you’ve got to subscribe by December 31st, and the deal is limited to one per household. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="obuFBw"&gt;Get three free months of Spotify — if you’re a new subscriber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zqxNBk"&gt;Spotify is running a holiday promo where you can &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/purchase/offer/holiday-2020-trial-3m"&gt;get three months of the leading subscription music service&lt;/a&gt; before having to fork over the regular $9.99 each month. Unfortunately, the deal is aimed at those who haven’t tried Spotify Premium before. That’s a bummer for existing customers, but if you’ve managed to stay a holdout all this time, now you can get the ad-free experience at no charge for the next three months. However, you’re also eligible for the offer if you canceled your Spotify Premium subscription prior to October 17th. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5VU3Q"&gt;It’s rare that Apple slashes the prices on its own products. Fortunately, other retailers are putting a lot of Apple products on sale for Black Friday. A bunch of retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Walmart, and Woot are slashing the prices on everything from wearables to its wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIuihu"&gt;Additionally, the online Apple store will have a special promotion on Friday, November 27th, and running until Monday, November 30th. The promotion will allow &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you to get up to $150 in an Apple gift card&lt;/a&gt; if you purchase an eligible product during the four-day event as listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple head of security accused of offering iPads as bribes for concealed gun permits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad 5 sonny dickinson" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IgD5ED1mBhH3f-YTSdBRBRl-aqk=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866809/ipad5sonny.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvXHac"&gt;A California grand jury has &lt;a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/newsroom/newsreleases/Documents/2020NRDocs/CCW%20Indictments%20-%20Sung.pdf"&gt;indicted&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s head of global security on charges that he tried to bribe Santa Clara County officials to procure firearms (CCW) licenses, &lt;a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/newsroom/newsreleases/Pages/NRA2020/CCW-Undersheriff-Sung-.aspx"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;. Santa Clara district attorney Jeff Rosen alleges that Thomas Moyer offered 200 iPads — worth about $70,000 — to Capt. James Jensen and Undersheriff Rick Sung in the Santa Clara County sheriff’s office, in exchange for four concealed firearms licenses for Apple employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWyVgE"&gt;The charges came after a two-year investigation. “In the case of four CCW licenses withheld from Apple employees, Undersheriff Sung and Cpt. Jensen managed to extract from Thomas Moyer a promise that Apple would donate iPads to the Sheriff’s Office,” Rosen said in the news release. The iPads were never delivered, according to Rosen’s office, because Sung and Moyer became aware in 2019 that the district attorney was executing a search warrant for the sheriff department’s CCW records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRwiKj"&gt;Moyer’s attorney, Ed Swanson, said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that his client is innocent of the charges filed against him, adding he believed Moyer was “collateral damage” in a dispute between the Santa Clara sheriff and district attorneys’ offices. “He did nothing wrong and has acted with the highest integrity throughout his career,” Swanson said. “We have no doubt he will be acquitted at trial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0EIBe"&gt;“We expect all of our employees to conduct themselves with integrity,” an Apple spokesperson said &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/11/apple-security-chief-maintains-innocence-after-bribery-charges/"&gt;in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “After learning of the allegations, we conducted a thorough internal investigation and found no wrongdoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdF7Lw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/apple-security-chief-accused-of-offering-to-bribe-officials"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Moyer has been at Apple for about 15 years and has been its head of global security since November 2018. He wrote a memo in 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;warning Apple employees&lt;/a&gt; about the potential consequences of leaking information to the media, which he wrote “can become part of your personal and professional identity forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3AH4l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 24th, 2:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added Apple statement given to &lt;/em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends deadline for requiring in-app purchases for apps selling online classes and events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/41Td2Civs3RZATncjC73iWzRr-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866441/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sls9lL"&gt;Apple on Monday announced &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=kw16tplo"&gt;an extension to its deadline&lt;/a&gt; for requiring in-app purchases for online events and classes offered within iOS apps to June 30th, 2021. Apple previously adjusted what types of events are subject to its in-app purchase policy and standard 30 percent cut back in September, with the original intention of requiring in-app purchases in all appropriate apps by December of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOgA4k"&gt;Apple cited the coronavirus pandemic, writing in a developer update posted to its website, “As the world fights COVID-19, we recognize that adapting experiences from in-person to digital continues to be a top priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y0dPqy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This deadline extension means developers have more time to temporarily reap the full profits of their sales&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XVXsTi"&gt;Requiring in-app purchase options for outside services like video streaming and exercise classes offered through iOS has been part of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business"&gt;the company’s policy&lt;/a&gt; for quite a while, but this specific change is focused on the adjustments made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455598/facebook-paid-events-apple-ios-30-percent-fees-waived"&gt;following Facebook’s September complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s issue was framed around event organizers losing out on much-needed money for their digital events offered through the Facebook app during COVID-19, because of Apple’s 30 percent in-app purchase commission. Apple decided to waive the fee till the end of the year, and the company adjusted its policy to focus on group events and classes to keep one-on-one experiences free from Apple fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vcUBs"&gt;This deadline extension means developers have more time to incorporate in-app purchases in their apps where applicable and to temporarily reap the full profits of their sales. Apple’s other recent App Store changes suggest it’s inclined to make some concessions, whether because of pressure from developers or regulatory scrutiny from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;on-going legal battle with Epic&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;anti-trust investigation in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLdR73"&gt;The best example is Apple’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;. Any developer making under $1 million in sales per year will be able to apply next year and if approved receive a reduced 15 percent App Store commission. Other companies like Amazon have negotiated such exemptions, albeit in back room deals rather than public battles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;Amazon Prime Video is able to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; with a reduced 15 percent Apple commission and sell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;in-app purchases and rentals&lt;/a&gt; without being forced to use Apple’s in-app purchase option. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze will soon support CarPlay’s split-view dashboard mode </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NaOh4tV63SAzV49sMyc9ixD94fI=/45x0:765x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845961/waze_carplay_split_view_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MxuQD5"&gt;Waze is finally coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18693555/apple-ios-13-carplay-interface-update-hands-on-test-review"&gt;Apple CarPlay’s new multiscreen dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. This is sure to come as welcome news to devotees of the Google-owned navigation app, who have been waiting for over a year for it to work with the much-improved, upgraded version of CarPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoA1EQ"&gt;A tipster who is beta testing the new feature sent us this image of Waze operating in CarPlay’s new Split View function. Apple rolled out the new dashboard as part of last year’s iOS 13 software update, but it was limited to only work with Apple Maps at the time. Previously, CarPlay required bouncing between different screens to see a track name while getting directions to a destination. With Split View, you can see a map, what’s currently playing on the car’s stereo, and the next piece of guidance to your destination all in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkicLT"&gt;Apple eventually released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194115/carplay-dashboard-third-party-map-support-ios-apple"&gt;iOS 13.4 earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, which introduced the option for third-party companies to add support for the dashboard mode on their own mapping apps. It took Google until August 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358978/google-maps-carplay-dashboard-mode-update-support-directions"&gt;implement support for Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;. And now it seems like Waze (which is also owned by Google) is soon to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sI35hT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 13’s best upgrade is in your car","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18693555/apple-ios-13-carplay-interface-update-hands-on-test-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BmWO7M"&gt;A spokesperson for Waze wouldn’t confirm the beta testing, so we’re not sure when the navigation company plans to officially announce the rollout. “We actually don’t have anything to share right now. Will be sure to keep you posted if/when we do,” the spokesperson said in an email. Waze has 140 million monthly active users who drive more than 24 billion miles (40 billion kilometers) every month. The company was founded in Israel in 2008 and was later acquired by Google in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNMc2j"&gt;The beta also features the first support for lane guidance in Waze for iOS, the tipster said. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437960/waze-lane-guidance-traffic-notifications-google-maps-features-amazon-music"&gt;This handy feature&lt;/a&gt; recommends what lane you should be in when you’re entering or exiting a freeway, for instance. It’s also helpful when navigating complicated intersections or highway mergers. The tipster described the ability to use Waze in CarPlay’s new split-screen dashboard as “really smooth” and a “game-changer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqPuXF"&gt;Like many companies, Waze has been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has emptied roadways around the world and sent many cities into lockdown. As sheltering in place and working from home become the new norm, fewer people are using Waze for their daily navigation needs. Fewer eyeballs on the app means less advertising revenue for the company, which led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428907/waze-layoff-pandemic-google-navigation-driving"&gt;Waze laying off 5 percent of its global workforce&lt;/a&gt;, or around 30 people, in September. More recently, the company’s CEO Noam Bardin announced that he would be &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/waze-ceo-noam-bardin-to-leave-company-in-early-2021/"&gt;stepping down in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6Z1yX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple TV remote has yet another alternate option that includes buttons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LWsJVe4yAZowA-QjHWTT8fIsNrQ=/0x71:1440x1031/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67840072/uei_remote.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universal Electronics new remote is for Apple TV&lt;/em&gt; | Universal Electronics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhEt5t"&gt;Universal Electronics Inc. (UEI) has introduced its version of the notoriously unpopular Apple TV remote “specifically developed and designed” for cable, satellite, and MVPD  (multichannel video program distributor) customers, &lt;a href="https://www.uei.com/press/2020/11/20/universal-electronics-inc-to-launch-apple-tv-remote-control-for-mvpds/"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmcekl"&gt;The remote uses Bluetooth low energy or infrared to connect with the box, has a microphone to speak commands to Siri, and its universal remote function allows control of TVs and audio devices from any brand or manufacturer. It has backlit keys, which activate via an ambient light sensor, a button to flip through channels, and a mute button, according to UEI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uTFoG"&gt;“We’re excited that customers worldwide will soon be able to enjoy this new remote, designed specifically for the growing number of MVPDs offering Apple TV 4K to their subscribers,” said Paul Arling, CEO of Universal Electronics, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dl5Ass"&gt;Universal isn’t the first company to introduce an Apple TV remote alternative; last year, Swiss TV and internet provider &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/9/21002605/apple-tv-remote-salt-swiss-tv-company-replacement-buttons-normal"&gt;Salt developed a remote&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with Apple after the touchpad controls on the native remote proved frustrating for users used to having standard buttons. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332433/apple-tv-remote-buttons-function-salt-siri-streaming-box-controller-price"&gt;Function introduced its Button Remote for Apple TV&lt;/a&gt; in July. The Salt model has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332433/apple-tv-remote-buttons-function-salt-siri-streaming-box-controller-price"&gt;difficult to buy&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrWHO3"&gt;UEI’s remote will be available beginning next year, but consumers won’t be able to buy the remote directly from Universal. The company plans to sell branded versions of the remote directly via the cable companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fq4pgE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoQ9WM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest teardown from iFixit shows how huge the iPhone 12 Pro Max camera is</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctoKDZ2fyt0fyi4Fs4Ns0IZ7Btk=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67839634/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has an enviable camera&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is Apple’s biggest iPhone ever, with a 6.7-inch display that boasts a camera system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;our reviewer called&lt;/a&gt; “one of the most confident smartphone cameras.” In its latest teardown, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fifixit.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F21%2F21588664%2Fapple-iphone-12-pro-max-teardown-ifixit-camera#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt; shows how big this impressive camera actually is compared to other iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7CJLcRZjqLg6Fj0KNzy1UKDp2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22064774/iphone_pro_max_12_camera.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max camera is quite large&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SrEDMF"&gt;The primary wide-angle sensor “dwarfs the iPhone 12’s sensor,” iFixit says, coming in around 47 percent larger. But it has the same 12 MP resolution as the smaller model. The 12 Pro Max’s sensor-shift image stabilization system— found on most DSLR cameras— adds bulk to the large main camera, iFixit found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pu0uma"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXjDFdNVnXo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0Zdbb"&gt;The 12 Pro Max’s L-shaped battery is the largest among all current iPhone models, weighing in at 14.13Wh, compared to the 8.57Wh in the mini and the 10.78 Wh in the 12 and 12 Pro. But iFixit notes that’s actually slightly smaller than the 15.04Wh pack found in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro Max. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GprY-JuSf5E6QLdwOI52IYPtyIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22064775/iphone_12_pro_max_battery_l.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max battery (right) dwarfs the other iPhone 12 model batteries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iRSQ2j"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max —the most expensive iPhone on the market right now starting at $1,099 — “is arguably Apple’s finest iPhone-related achievement this year,” iFixit says. The device adds “demanding 5G tech with no obvious compromises to other components.” Check out &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPhone%2B12%2BPro%2BMax%2BTeardown%2F138640%3Fvgo_ee%3D3bheJeT%252FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%252BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F21%2F21588664%2Fapple-iphone-12-pro-max-teardown-ifixit-camera#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit’s full teardown&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 12 Pro Max here. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vo5w1S"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563821/vergecast-podcast-430-apple-iphone-mini-pro-max-m1-chips-macbook"&gt;Last week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the crew spent some time discussing Apple’s announcement of new Mac computers with its own Arm-based processor chip, which Apple is calling the M1. This week, &lt;em&gt;Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn got their hands on the new &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OEaKQ0pxQsg"&gt;MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with the M1 chips&lt;/a&gt; for review and brought their findings to this week’s episode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpzz3D"&gt;Nilay and Dieter also bring in deputy editor Dan Seifert and editor Chris Welch to discuss their experiences with the new computers in regards to performance, battery life, and running iOS apps on macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RsaTui"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7961322068" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6vJ1Ec"&gt;But before they got into all of that, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; starts the discussion with an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/walt-mossberg-verge"&gt;legendary tech reviewer Walt Mossberg&lt;/a&gt;, who was able to try out the new MacBook Air for himself. Walt gives his first impressions as well as some background behind what he calls “one of the most seminal products of the last 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAAt31"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a lightly edited excerpt from that conversation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="119csa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nilay Patel: We have obviously just reviewed the new MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 chip, and you have had one as well. I’m dying to know what you think of this sort of major internal change to the Mac even though the outside kind of looks the same. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrWw2g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walt Mossberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so I just want to say one thing first: I actually believe that the MacBook — which you know and I know was the thing that the Windows guys were trying to copy for years and years — doesn’t get enough credit for being one of the seminal products of the last 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Leg23"&gt;I mean, it’s not as seminal as the iPhone or the first Android phone or whatever. But it was a seminal product because light, thin laptops tended to be cramped before the MacBook Air, and there were a lot of compromises. And the MacBook Air also kind of almost tied — I think it maybe was a month before one of the ThinkPads — in having an SSD. There were a bunch of things about it that were notable. And then the 2010 one was a huge improvement, and then the 2013 one, ironically, given what’s happening now because of an Intel chip — the Haswell chip at the time — which was specifically meant to give a huge leap in battery life. &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130618/power-testing-can-two-new-laptops-really-last-all-day/"&gt;I got in my test. I looked it up&lt;/a&gt;. I got 12 hours on it, and they were only claiming 10 different battery tests, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f0yAo"&gt;So I think the MacBook Air is a really important consumer tech product. And I think this one is — I mean, I agree with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Dieter’s review&lt;/a&gt; — I think it’s sort of amazing. I mean, we’ve all known they were going to do this. I’m no chip expert, processor expert, but from what I can understand, they’ve pulled off something amazing in a relatively short time. And by that, I mean it takes a long time to develop a processor. It’s not like doing some other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CVBFn"&gt;So in my use of this, I think the single thing that has impressed me most, the battery life has impressed me. I’ve not plugged this in in about 36 hours, and I have 75 percent battery life. So that’s fantastic. It’s buttery smooth. It’s fast as can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsqQZi"&gt;But the thing that really impresses me is their translation layer. This thing called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304182/apple-arm-mac-rosetta-2-emulation-app-converter-explainer"&gt;Rosetta 2&lt;/a&gt;. They had a Rosetta when they made another processor change some years ago. And what it does is it takes apps that have not been written for this processor that were written for the Intel — which is most of the third-party apps so far — and it runs them. And I got to tell you, they run fast. They run normally. I mean, fast. If you were doing a blind test and you didn’t know this was originally written for Intel, still written for Intel, and it was running through this Rosetta thing, you would never know it. At least that’s been my experience. I don’t know if it’s been yours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XplDlN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter Bohn: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, no, completely. To me, that’s one of the most impressive parts. Maybe if you were staring at how many times it bounced in the dock when it launched for the first time after reboot or something, you might be able to tell the difference. But otherwise, just exactly the same. And it’s my understanding that they co-developed this processor hardware with Rosetta 2 in mind and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdORax"&gt;So I think part of what’s happening here is this whole thing where Apple says we are able to integrate hardware and software that makes our stuff really special — sometimes that seems like a true claim, and sometimes it seems like it’s more marketing than reality. I think in this particular case with Rosetta 2, it’s absolutely reality that I don’t think their translation software would have worked as well if the chip team didn’t know it was coming and they didn’t know what was on the chip. My hunch is there’s some sort of thing inside the M1 chip that is just there just to make Rosetta fast.&lt;/p&gt;
