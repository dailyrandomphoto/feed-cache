    <title>Apple’s new Find My feature could let you know if you’re the one being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uu22iw8ZbremJQTbBPB24Di5UwQ=/1006x321:2825x1534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68914440/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_12.42.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KuLOxg"&gt;Apple’s Find My app might get a new safety feature to help prevent someone from using the kinds of devices tracked in the app to stalk you instead. “Item Safety Alerts”, spotted in the iOS 14.5 beta, will notify you if an unknown device being tracked on Find My is “moving with you” so you can remove it or disable it, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/04/ios-14-5-beta-3-changes-features-airtags-find-my-item-safety-alerts-video/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fv8saz"&gt;The feature seems designed to counteract a scenario where a Find My-compatible device is hidden in a pocket or bag and then used to track someone’s movements. The Item Safety Alerts setting was found in early versions of iOS 14.3, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/04/apple-brings-back-airtags-anti-stalking-feature"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but was removed until its reappearance in iOS 14.5. The setting is enabled by default in the beta and Apple seems to want it to stay on. If you turn off the setting off, the system will warn you that unknown devices can see your location without you being notified, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1367483996905570317"&gt;Apple blogger Benjamin Mayo&lt;/a&gt; shared on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZW2Rg5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Something I hadn’t considered before: new beta includes a Item Safety setting in Find My. This is how Apple is trying to prevent 'stalking' with AirTags. If someone secretly hides a tag in your possessions, your phone will notice and warn you about it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NVJyAZlthw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NVJyAZlthw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1367483996905570317?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xsUT0a"&gt;Addressing the risk of stalking in Find My is newly important because of Apple’s plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;open up the app to third-party accessories&lt;/a&gt;. Hiding an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook in someone’s bag to track them is difficult, but a small keychain-sized device like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;Tile’s upcoming ultra wideband (UWB) tracker&lt;/a&gt; could be a lot easier. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt; could also be a candidate for misuse, and reintroducing this feature into iOS might mean they’re on their way to release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tXg8jy9k8c0dG_TGibgzY3HIsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345924/iOS_14.5_Beta_3_AirTags_Item_Safety_Alerts.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My settings screen with ‘Item Safety Alerts’ turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="PyrCdp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10318020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UyRnzj"&gt;While it’s not necessarily as powerful as a GPS beacon with a cellular radio, Apple’s Find My network may have more reach than you’d think. If an Apple device comes near one of these supported trackers, it can update its location, even if the tracker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647146/apple-find-my-app-tracker-friends-iphone-wwdc-2019"&gt;doesn’t have its own connection to the internet&lt;/a&gt;. Tile’s “Community Find” feature works similarly. AirTags could theoretically expand the reach and precision even more, with an added UWB signal in the tag that can make items easier to find behind walls and in other rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54ZRpg"&gt;There are at least a few examples where gadgets like this have been abused: In 2018, a woman in Texas noticed her ex-partner kept showing up at restaurants, other people’s houses, and even an out-of-town trip, without a clear way of knowing where she was, &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/woman-says-ex-used-tile-device-to-stalk-her/3719155/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC 13 &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. She’d later learn her ex had stashed a Tile tracker in the front console of her car, and was using it to find her. A Texas beauty queen shared &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/texas-beauty-queen-claims-stranger-targeted-tracking-device/story?id=38749046"&gt;a similar stalking story in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple clarifies that iOS 14.5 won’t let you permanently choose a new default music service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfwKUOnxyiybiW5YVbTtwQCpJT0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913130/akrales_190522_3444_0021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pceXmG"&gt;iOS 14.5 is in beta right now, and the first beta appeared to have a long-awaited feature: it seemed you would be able to set Spotify and other music services as the default for Siri requests. But Apple has clarified &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the feature doesn’t actually work that way. Instead, selecting a music service for Siri requests is apparently intended to improve Siri’s smarts so that it can better know your audio-listening preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="penUze"&gt;In our testing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify"&gt;the first iOS 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt;, when you would ask Siri to play a song, it would show a list of music services to play a song from. After you made your choice, Siri song requests would then play from the service you selected without requiring you to pick again. But you’re not actually picking a default service, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnCp6L"&gt;“The feature is an attempt to help Siri to learn the listening apps you want to use for different types of audio content — not just music,” according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “Perhaps you want to use Spotify to listen to music, but prefer to keep up with your podcasts in Apple Podcasts or some other third-party podcasts app. And you may want to listen to audiobooks in yet another app.” Apple’s assistant may even ask your preference again in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyDZHb"&gt;Apple also noted to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;that there’s no setting in iOS where you can set your music service default, unlike the options available for setting a default email service or browser. (We also observed this when we tested the feature with the first beta of iOS 14.5.) However, you can still ask that a song play from a specific service as part of your Siri request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAXYrI"&gt;Apple still seems to be tweaking the feature, as it was &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/17/hands-on-with-ios-14-5-beta-2-changes-and-features-video/"&gt;dropped from the second beta&lt;/a&gt; before being reintroduced this week with the third. And because it is still in beta, there’s always the chance the feature could change ahead of the final release. Apple declined to comment if it would appear in the public version of iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELyk0O"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 4th, 7:45PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Apple declined to comment on if the feature would appear in the final version of iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenHaystack is a new open-source tool that lets you create DIY AirTags on Apple’s Find My network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OpenHaystack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWv4gZcgIkCpqVS0u4KSp5A2mEM=/155x0:1748x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911699/OpenHaystack_Screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OpenHaystack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzuy7b"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;promised to open up its Find My app to third-party accessory makers&lt;/a&gt;. But ahead of that, there’s a new tool that will let anybody make their own Bluetooth tracking tag to use with the Find My network so they can track its location. &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack#installation"&gt;OpenHaystack&lt;/a&gt; is a new open-source tool developed by security researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/seemoo/seemoo/index.en.jsp"&gt;Secure Mobile Networking Lab&lt;/a&gt;, who have essentially reverse-engineered the way Apple devices register themselves to the Find My mesh network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEZeQU"&gt;It is, in short, a way to create your own DIY AirTags today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zlLXv"&gt;OpenHaystack works via a custom Mac app that can be used to track the location of custom tags that you create. As of right now, the tool has direct support to make a tracking tag using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910685/bbc-micro-bit-final-design-giving-away-to-kids"&gt;BBC micro:bit mini computer&lt;/a&gt;, though other Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device support could be added by other developers in the future. Once registered on Apple’s Find My network, the OpenHaystack app will be able to report the tag’s location just like Apple’s Find My app works for iPhones and other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvYYZC"&gt;The whole system is a bit of a hack — in the sense that it’s complex, not in the sense that it’s actually hacking anything. It uses a plugin for Apple Mail (which authenticates you as a genuine Apple user) to get the necessary access to Apple’s Find My network to create and locate the keys — so Mail needs to be running for OpenHaystack to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPS6sM"&gt;There don’t appear to be serious security implications for the Find My network itself, either (though the team has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849"&gt;submitted other bug reports to Apple&lt;/a&gt;). That doesn’t mean you should just go ahead and start using OpenHaystack, however. There’s an important disclaimer on the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XbBH78"&gt;OpenHaystack is experimental software. The code is untested and incomplete. For example, OpenHaystack tags using our &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware"&gt;firmware&lt;/a&gt; broadcast a fixed public key and, therefore, are trackable by other devices in proximity (this might change in a future release). OpenHaystack is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GB48S3"&gt;A high-level understanding of how the security model for Find My works also helps understand why OpenHaystack is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToMNk7"&gt;Find My works by using a combination of public and private keys. Any Apple user can access the public keys for devices in the Find My network, but you need the private key in order to actually access location information. This means not even Apple can access your location information without your private keys. The network is possible because Apple devices communally track the public keys, but only users can get location data from private keys.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How OpenHaystack gets on the FindMy network" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbLNvcqV7Wz51mhNC1yaLl405Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345345/FindMyOverview.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OpenHaystack&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How OpenHaystack gets on the Find My network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n70MOz"&gt;What OpenHaystack does is create one of those public / private key pairs for your own Bluetooth tag and uses Apple Mail to register it in the Find My network. To Apple, it just looks like another iPhone. The Mac app then accesses the public key database, pairs it with the private key you created, and bam: secure location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byvR9j"&gt;From the way it’s designed, it seems like it might be difficult for Apple to cut off OpenHaystack easily without also cutting off a bunch of older Apple devices. However, it’s also surely true that Apple as a company won’t like the whole thing and may try to find a way to block it. A developer could use the system to create a way to add Android devices to the Find My network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnABVp"&gt;The team behind OpenHaystack has written a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02282"&gt;paper detailing its methods&lt;/a&gt; and disclosing a now-fixed security flaw. It also released the &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware"&gt;source code for its firmware&lt;/a&gt;, which other developers could use to adapt OpenHaystack to other BLE devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhvZGZ"&gt;Apple’s &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; support for third-party accessories is still coming. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-AUC002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22313461%2Fopenhaystack-apple-find-my-network-diy-airtags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin has already announced a set of earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that will support Find My. Given how complex the setup of OpenHaystack is, it probably won’t gain mass adoption. It’s similar in some ways to AirMessage and Beeper, two tools that use Mac utilities to redirect iMessages to Android devices. Apple’s ecosystem is locked down in any number of ways, but the Mac finds a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TTDZk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Losing YouTube on the old Apple TV underscores how far ahead competitors are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vgNgIDxQvifYJQMBBbMX2HPZt3s=/0x0:1037x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905907/appletv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktv7q8"&gt;The YouTube app on older Apple TV models has officially been discontinued as of today. If you have a third-generation device (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/14/2870779/apple-tv-review-2012"&gt;the 2012-era model&lt;/a&gt; that predated the modern tvOS-based set-top boxes), you’ll only be able to stream YouTube through an iOS device using AirPlay starting today, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/03/older-apple-tv-will-require-airplay-for-youtube-video-playback-starting-next-month/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbm3Xl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265965/apple-tv-3rd-gen-youtube-native-onboard-support-airplay"&gt;While the news&lt;/a&gt; has been known for a while, the change highlights a key issue with the Apple TV ecosystem. Namely, that it’s been nearly three and a half years since Apple has last updated its streaming box hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YzIXC"&gt;If you own the old model with the now defunct YouTube app, your only Apple-made options are the 2017 Apple TV 4K or what Apple now calls the Apple TV HD, the older model from 2015. That’s particularly problematic, given that the Apple TV 4K still starts at $179 (with a pricier 64GB model that offers double the storage for $199), despite being released years ago. Even the Apple TV HD still costs $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xL6HP2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best streaming device to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="131UHf"&gt;That’s in stark comparison to competitors like Amazon, Google, and Roku, which have released newer streaming products that offer the same (if not better) features than Apple’s outdated box at far lower prices. Roku’s flagship streaming box, the Roku Ultra, costs $99 — nearly half the price of the entry-level Apple TV 4K — while supporting 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Apple’s own AirPlay 2 streaming. The $50 Streaming Stick Plus offers 4K and HDR (without Dolby Vision) for those looking to save even more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzpZWk"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Cube costs $119.99 and offers similar high-end streaming specs, while also doubling as a full-fledged Echo speaker. Like Roku, Amazon also has its cheaper $50 Fire TV Stick 4K, which offers the full gamut of streaming support (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, and HDR10) without the added Alexa speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4oWWs"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s latest Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, which costs just $50, offers excellent content curation, supports 4K, HDR, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision, and remains &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s best choice for a streaming stick in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Khq9Gq"&gt;With more and more apps starting to end support for Apple’s older streaming boxes (CBS All Access has already announced that it’ll be enacting a similar change when Paramount Plus launches), the problem of the Apple TV’s outdated hardware and pricing are only going to continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPkleZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article previously stated that Apple’s only remaining TV hardware was the Apple TV 4K. It has been updated to reflect that Apple still sells the older Apple TV HD. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple now lets you automatically transfer your iCloud Photo Library to Google Photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-O7yIeZOplUwpIsFuP79ABD7WEs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905811/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B6Vb1x"&gt;Apple has added a service that lets you automatically transfer photos, videos, and albums from your iCloud Photo Library to Google Photos (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/apple-transfer-icloud-photos-google-photos/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The feature has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208514"&gt;a support document outlining the procedure&lt;/a&gt;, which simply entails going to &lt;a href="https://privacy.apple.com/"&gt;privacy.apple.com&lt;/a&gt;, logging in, and going through the “transfer a copy of your data” process. Apple says the transfer will take between three days to a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlPxfA"&gt;Some things won’t transfer: Apple says shared albums, smart albums, photo stream content, live photos, some metadata, and media that isn’t stored in your iCloud Photo Library won’t come along for the ride. The part about Live Photos is especially eyebrow-raising. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207310"&gt;iPhones take Live Photos by default&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple doesn’t make it clear if the entire picture will be left behind, or just the video clip surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mk15DTxUNHvZ7V2VrURoGN8T2rg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343247/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_12.23.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MKDR7D"&gt;For what it’s worth, the transfer tool tells me 10,793 of my photos will be transferred, which is the exact number of pictures in my library. Given that over 2,500 of those are Live, it would seem Apple is planning on transferring them, but we did reach out to clarify. At the time of writing, we haven't heard back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOq2XL"&gt;Apple says the feature won’t remove anything from your iCloud Photo Library; it will simply make a copy of it, so you’ll still need to manually delete things if you no longer want them stored in iCloud. Additionally, the feature is currently only available to people in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHmI7k"&gt;If you’re looking to make the jump from iPhone to Android or just want to use Google Photos, this tool should provide an easy way to quickly transfer all of your photos to the service without having to reupload them yourself. A few clicks, and your photos will be on their way to their new home. Just make sure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;you have enough Google storage space&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arizona advances bill forcing Apple and Google to allow Fortnite-style alternative payment options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TWEgfW8HMIiY9WkmROupVEYvJps=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905040/bfarsace_201106_4269_001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4YCz23"&gt;The Arizona House of Representatives just passed landmark app store legislation in a 31-29 vote on Wednesday that could have far-reaching consequences for Apple and Google and their respective mobile operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwGZtT"&gt;The legislation, a &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;sweeping amendment to Arizona’s existing HB2005&lt;/a&gt;, prevents app store operators from forcing a developer based in the state to use a preferred payment system, putting up a significant roadblock to Apple and Google’s ability to collect commissions on in-app purchases and app sales. It will now head to the state senate, where it must pass before its sent to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDD94Y"&gt;The amendment specifically prohibits stores exceeding 1 million downloads from requiring “a developer that is domiciled in this state to use a particular in-application payments system as the exclusive mode of accretive payments from a user.” It also covers users living in Arizona from having to pay for apps using exclusive payment systems, though it’s not immediately clear if that means developers outside Arizona can avoid paying commission to Apple and Google when they sell something to a state resident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPkq8S"&gt;The bill specifically exempts game consoles “and other special-purpose devices that are connected to the internet,” and it also bars companies like Apple and Google from retaliating against developers who choose to use third-party payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yZst2P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bill opens the door to alternative payment systems on iOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo2fXl"&gt;The amendment narrowly passed the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week in a 7-6 vote, which sent it to the floor of the state’s House of Representatives for a full vote on Wednesday. Notable opponents of the bill have been Arizona Democrats, who’ve argued that state legislatures shouldn’t get involved in ongoing legal matters between companies, in reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; between Apple and Google and companies like &lt;em&gt;Forntite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games. There was also concern the bill would interfere with interstate commerce and raise unconstitutionality claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQuEBI"&gt;The bill opens the door to developers using third-party payment systems, thereby allowing them to bypass the industry standard 30 percent cut Apple and Google have collected for years. It’s not clear how the tech companies will respond, as the bill could have significant effects on their businesses in the state of Arizona while also putting pressure on them to change the rules for all developers everywhere. Both Apple and Google declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6jqkl"&gt;“Today, Arizona put a marker down and became the first state in the nation to advance a digital market that is free and fair,” said the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), the industry group composed of Epic, Tinder parent company company Match Group, and Spotify that is responsible for helping draft the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySd8Ae"&gt;“The Coalition for App Fairness is pleased to see the House passage of HB 2005, which will encourage business innovation in Arizona and protect consumer choice. While this is cause for celebration, it is only a first step toward achieving a truly level playing field for all,” the statement goes on to say. “We look forward to working with the Arizona State Senate to move a solution forward that builds on this momentum to provide consumer freedom, lower costs, and increase developers’ ability to thrive and innovate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oco2KR"&gt;The bill has attracted intense lobbying from Apple and Google. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;published earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, Apple tapped lobbyist Rod Diridon and also hired Kirk Adams, the former chief of staff to Arizona’s governor, to help make its case to the House of Representatives. Apple also joined the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and pushed the body to begin combating the bill, &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;reported. “We went through a very difficult weekend where Apple and Google hired probably almost every lobbyist in town,” Arizona State Rep. Regina Cobb, a Republican and the primary sponsor of the bill, told&lt;em&gt; Protocol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULD3Hv"&gt;In testimony in front of the House, Apple’s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, made the case that the App Store provides value to developers that warrant its commission. “The commission has been described by some special interests as a ‘payment processing fee’—as if Apple is just swiping a credit card. That’s terribly misleading. Apple provides developers an enormous amount of value — both the store to distribute their apps around the world and the studio to create them. That is what the commission reflects,” Andeer said in written testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sd59ZZ"&gt;“Yet this bill tells Apple that it cannot use its own check-out lane (and collect a commission) in the store we built,” he goes on. “This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free — even if they’re selling digital goods, even if they’re making millions or even billions of dollars doing it. The bill is a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcWRtn"&gt;“Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone. Because of that, for any app that offers digital services like games or music, you have to pay through Apple or Google’s monopolistic payment processing system,” Cobb wrote in an &lt;a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/02/19/its-time-to-free-ourselves-from-big-tech-monopoly/"&gt;op-ed for the &lt;em&gt;Arizona Capitol Times&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “You have to use their system and their payment processor, and then they tax you for it. Small app developers have to absorb the cost and struggle to survive or pass the tax onto their consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4X4AfZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kxcyR5"&gt;The sentiment is one shared by vocal critics of Apple and Google, like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. He has submitted testimony for two bills — this one in Arizona and another in North Dakota — in support of legislation to break up what he sees as monopolies on software distribution, and he’s waged an impassioned campaign against Apple in particular since last summer, when the iPhone maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;engaged in a dispute with Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; over its new Hey email application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XrU4T"&gt;“Apple operates a tollbooth on the only road to distribution of mobile software for the dominant iPhone platform. And this doesn’t just hurt app developers, but consumers as well. When Apple tried to shake down our company for the 30% cut of revenues, they explicitly encouraged us simply to pass on the cost to consumers. And that’s exactly what other developers have done,” Hansson wrote in testimony to the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week. He added that the bill “would not only provide immediate relief to Arizona developers and consumers, it would instantly make the state the most desirable place on earth to start a new software company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvANiS"&gt;The bill is one of many — including ones in Georgia, Hawaii, and Minnesota, as well as one that already failed in the North Dakota state senate — making their way through local legislatures. The multistate push can be drawn back to a national lobbying effort from the CAF. The industry group consists of not only Epic, Match, and Spotify, but also dozens of other companies dissatisfied with the rules imposed by Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. Epic is also engaged in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against both Apple and Google over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last summer, a dispute that sits at the heart of the ongoing app store debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3CIISd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bills are part of a multistate lobbying effort from the Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBPaKu"&gt;The CAF, which worked alongside Match to approach Cobb for HB2005, has been hiring lobbyists around the country to approach representatives with draft bills that would make it easier for developers to bypass rules thought to be ironclad within the mobile app world. Specifically for Apple, these bills are targeting rules dictating that iOS users and the platform’s developers only buy, sell, and distribute software through the App Store. (Google allows alternative app stores on Android, though it does present security warnings and other obstacles to users who download and use them.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNk0wf"&gt;Additionally, these bills are taking aim at rules saying app makers must use the preferred payment systems of Apple and Google, as a backup defense in the event alternative app stores remain off the table. It’s those terms, written into developer agreements the companies make app makers sign to distribute software through the stores, that allow both companies to take anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of all revenue generated from digital goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir14ht"&gt;The Arizona bill follows a similar, though broader and potentially more disruptive bill in North Dakota that last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failed to pass the state’s senate&lt;/a&gt;. The North Dakota bill would have forced Apple and Google to allow alternative app stores onto iOS and Android, in addition to allowing developers to use alternative payment systems. The North Dakota bill, which failed in an 11-36 vote, would have also barred companies from retaliating against developers that opted to use alternative app stores or payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj1Erq"&gt;Apple similarly lobbied hard against the North Dakota bill, with Apple’s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, testifying that the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it.” He further argued that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdVDxR"&gt;Central to all of these bills and the fierce lobbying efforts surrounding them from both sides is a debate threatening one of the most lucrative pillars of Apple’s (and to a lesser extent Google’s) business: Should app store owners be able to set the rules for what kind of software is allowed onto mobile phones, and should those rules also force developers into paying commissions for accessing the platform? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBdiGX"&gt;Just a few years ago, that Apple and other companies would take 30 percent of all revenue was considered a settled matter. While some companies, like Netflix and Spotify, complained vigorously about unfair treatment, Apple’s iron grip on the App Store, and by extension the iPhone, felt inexorable. It was simply how mobile app distribution worked — unless you were a large company like Amazon, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;cut special deals with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="w8Xx9F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WCuqfA"&gt;But growing resentment from developers large and small, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301453/antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-reform-cicilline-buck"&gt;an upswell in regulatory fervor in Washington&lt;/a&gt;, and growing consumer hostility toward Big Tech have created an unprecedented movement hoping to rein in Silicon Valley’s most powerful corporations. Square in the sights of all these parties is the App Store — specifically the 30 percent cut, or “Apple tax” as it has come to be known, and the payment system requirements that help enforce it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUSoVB"&gt;Apple has already made some concessions in its relationship to developers in response to rising antitrust pressure. Most prominently, the company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;new small business program late last year&lt;/a&gt; allowing developers making less than $1 million in annual revenue to lower the App Store cut they pay to Apple from 30 percent to 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLbUvg"&gt;But those concessions are far from stopping Apple’s critics, nor the lobbying efforts of its most committed opponents, from pushing for more. “Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them, and soon that might well be most of the economy,” Hansson wrote in the conclusion of his HB2005 testimony. “Giving us at least a fighting chance by enforcing a choice in payment processing is the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6B1z3"&gt;Following the bill’s passing, Hansson said his company Basecamp was fully prepared to relocate to Arizona to take advantage of the perks. “This means everything,” he wrote on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wljdkv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are going to prepare app updates for both Android and iOS that give Arizonans the right to signup for service using our normal payment processing setup. Then start the conversation with lawyers on what it’ll take to relocate Basecamp to Arizona. This means everything.&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1367197326041903106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Q0PhN"&gt;Microsoft’s newest Garage app, the company’s brand for more experimental apps, is Group Transcribe, which lets groups of people capture real-time collective meeting transcriptions using their phones. It’s available for free right now &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/group-transcribe/id1527145885"&gt;on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufnfWH"&gt;“This app uses a multi-device approach to provide real-time, high quality transcription and translation, so users can be more present and productive during in-person meetings and conversations,” Microsoft’s Lainie Huston &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fgarage%2Fblog%2F2021%2F03%2Fnew-garage-project-group-transcribe-helps-you-transcribe-and-translate-while-advancing-inclusive-speech-ai%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwWGa2"&gt;Here’s how it works. Everyone who wants to participate in the group transcription needs to download the Group Transcribe app. Then, one person kicks off a transcription, and they can invite others to join by sharing a five-letter conversation code, a QR code, or by joining the group transcription with nearby sharing over Bluetooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTUgwH"&gt;Then, the app will begin transcribing the group’s conversation, noting who said what. Group Transcribe can even also auto-translate things people say and show those translations in line as part of the transcription. Transcriptions are saved in the app so you can review or share them after a meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Xyr3L"&gt;Here’s a screenshot of what the transcriptions and translations look like:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-eXa2Yr5aAZ4ihLmJuST8_vyGs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342744/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uZDS7g"&gt;Microsoft suggests that each person participating in the meeting should use their own phone “within arm’s reach” to have “the highest quality experience.” And in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Ftranslator%2Fgroup-transcribe-faq%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft says Group Transcribe doesn’t have a limit to how many people can join a transcription, but it notes that the app works best for “in-person meetings [with] up to four people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDwh5E"&gt;Microsoft doesn’t require you to sign in with any sort of account to use the app — you just have to enter your name and your preferred language. The app does send data to the cloud as part of the transcription and speaker identification process, but Microsoft lets you choose whether you want to share meeting recordings with the company that it will use to help improve Microsoft’s speech recognition technologies. And if you’re making a group transcription, everyone in the group needs to have agreed to share recordings before one is shared with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="razzrZ"&gt;You can read more about the app and its privacy features in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Ftranslator%2Fgroup-transcribe-faq%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu reenables picture-in-picture mode for iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uNtJSzqC9AgW8pyvNnmoR0Mb2Hw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68899685/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xR9ZDv"&gt;Hulu has fully reenabled picture-in-picture support (PiP) on iOS, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/hulu-ios-14-picture-in-picture/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, which means half-watching network TV is once again possible for Hulu subscribers on iPhone and iPad devices. Hulu joins a collection of major streaming services that support the feature on iOS, leaving YouTube as the major exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ja70VW"&gt;PiP for iPhones was enabled for Hulu around iOS 14’s original release, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1364725362610045012?s=20"&gt;but it was later disabled&lt;/a&gt; to “work on a few updates to provide the best experience for our viewers,” Hulu said. Now that the feature is back, users can enable PiP mode by starting a show or movie and touching the PiP button to pop the video into a resizable, floating player.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TPLyeL_eZoStuGcFUipTJnmfLS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22340593/B10DEEF4_5290_42FD_ACC5_EF5B41A0FC22_1_201_a.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The picture-in-picture button inside Hulu’s app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tExGZC"&gt;Hulu joins services like Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Max in supporting PiP. All of those services now either feature a dedicated PiP button like Hulu or default to picture-in-picture if you swipe to the home screen while a video is playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYDk5g"&gt;YouTube remains the odd one out. Picture-in-picture is not allowed in Google’s official YouTube app for iOS. Paying for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium"&gt;YouTube Premium&lt;/a&gt; enables background play, but that only extends to audio on iOS. Google has also periodically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445912/youtube-videos-website-picture-in-picture-ios-14-google-apple-premium"&gt;disabled&lt;/a&gt; and reenabled PiP support for the web version of YouTube on iOS. As of October 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498327/youtube-picture-in-picture-web-safari-ios-14-chrome-background-playback"&gt;PiP was possible again&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn’t appear to work as of today. Right now, only iPhones running the iOS 14.5 beta can do PiP on the web version of YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/youtube-site-picture-in-picture-ios-14-5-beta/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llzwKo"&gt;If you’re curious how to get PiP set up on your own device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451195/apple-iphone-ipad-pip-picture-in-picture-how-to-use-youtube"&gt;check out &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s latest Mars rover has the same processor as an iMac from 1998</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WdyzQxGIpNdTBf-vhuyJR0P52e0=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68899353/25_feb_peserverance4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9hdibO"&gt;NASA’s brand-new Perseverance rover is the most advanced machine that’s ever landed on Mars. But when it comes to rovers, “state of the art” is a subjective term. Perseverance is running on none other than a PowerPC 750, a single-core, 233MHz processor with just 6 million transistors that’s most famous for powering the original “Bondi blue” iMac from 1998. It’s the same type of processor that NASA already uses in its Curiosity rover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDaHYt"&gt;That may seem like a waste to some. After all, even with the difficulty of buying computer parts these days, surely NASA&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;could have found the budget for something like Intel’s $500 &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/i9-processors/i9-10900k.html"&gt;Core i9-10900K&lt;/a&gt; CPU (with 10 cores and a max clock speed of 5.3GHz) somewhere in the $2.7 billion cost of Perseverance. But &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2269403-the-perseverance-rover-runs-on-processors-used-in-imacs-in-the-1990s/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;, such an advanced chip is actually a detriment to the unique operating conditions of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xquwjpUh81lOY2W3EQ4rOpBiC3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7009607/angled_original_imac_large_2x.0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bOIjEu"&gt;That’s largely because Mars’ atmosphere offers far less protection from harmful radiation and charged particles than Earth’s atmosphere. A bad burst of radiation can badly wreck the sensitive electronics of a modern processor — and the more complex the chip, the more can go wrong. Plus, at 138 million miles away, it’s not like NASA can just swap out the processor if things go sideways. Because of those conditions, Perseverance actually features two computing modules: one is a backup just in case something goes wrong. (A third copy of the module is also on board for image analysis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EBVbb"&gt;To make the system even more durable, the PowerPC 750 chip in Perseverance is a little different than the one in the old iMacs. It’s technically &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750"&gt;a RAD750 chip&lt;/a&gt;, a special variant that’s hardened against radiation and costs upwards of $200,000. The chip is popular for spacecraft, too: in addition to Perseverance and Curiosity, it also powers the Fermi Space Telescope, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/20/4752114/deep-impact-mission-ends-NASA"&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/a&gt; comet-hunting spacecraft, and the Kepler telescope, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkHqH5"&gt;While the processor may be weak compared to a modern smartphone or gaming PC, &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/brains/"&gt;NASA’s spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; for Perseverance notes that it’s far more powerful than earlier rovers like Spirit or Opportunity: its 200MHz clock speed is 10 times faster than those older rovers, and with 2GB of flash memory, it offers eight times the storage. (Rounding things out, Perseverance also has 256MB of RAM in case you were looking to build your own rover.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4laQzH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Linux has made it to Mars","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291324/linux-perseverance-mars-curiosity-ingenuity"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HSQ57a"&gt;But while the chip itself has been to Mars before, Perseverance features some new computer technology that’s debuting on the planet for the first time: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291324/linux-perseverance-mars-curiosity-ingenuity"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which powers the Ingenuity helicopter that will attempt to fly autonomously on Mars as part of Perseverance’s mission. &lt;/p&gt;
