    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r5nDrl"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787144/apple-home-repair-iphone-mac-parts-tools-instructions"&gt;newly announced&lt;/a&gt; Self Service Repair program, set to launch in early 2022, will finally provide individual customers access to genuine Apple OEM parts and manuals for DIY iPhone (and eventually Mac) repairs. Although this program has limitations, and there are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F55370%2Fapple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22787245%2Fapple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many lingering questions&lt;/a&gt; about how it will be implemented, it is an opportunity for Apple to improve relationships with its customers by making repairs easier. If Apple prices the parts right, the program could also be a way for motivated customers to save money on repairs by going DIY while allowing independent repair shops to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47lmru"&gt;Until now, access to factory OEM parts for iPhones and Macs has been restricted to several Apple-blessed places, including Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASP), Apple Stores, and Apple Independent Repair Providers (IRP), a program that allows independent shops to gain access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training guides for common out-of-warranty Mac and iPhone repairs. Apple’s new self-service program — just like the IRP program — is focused only on screen, battery, and camera repairs when it comes to iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVd3Jc"&gt;Apple plans to become the main resource for individuals looking for access to parts and manuals — &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt; “more than 200 individual parts and tools” for iPhone 12 and 13 models early next year. While that number sounds high given that the self-service program will launch with parts for just two models of iPhones, Kevin Purdy, a writer for online repair guide site iFixit, found it believable. Apple, he says, could sell various adhesives, specialty tools, individual screws, custom presses, electrostatic discharge mats, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Illustration of girl at a workbench with various tools preparing to work on a replacement screen for an iPhone 12 or 13 pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1LxDtb991b4UeOa2L-dDyebr2h8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23026632/Apple_Self_Service_Repair_self_service_11172021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This illustration from an Apple press release depicts at least 10 parts and tools for a single repair coming out of one shipping box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xdhzC2"&gt;These parts are already available to Apple service providers, and the prices are pretty high because the devices are so new. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;Apple itself&lt;/a&gt; charges customers $279 to repair the screen of an iPhone 12 or iPhone 13 Pro. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F55370%2Fapple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22787245%2Fapple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to iFixit&lt;/a&gt;, members of Apple’s IRP program pay about $270 to stock up on these screens (nearly the same as what Apple charges for the repair). However, the out-of-pocket cost for IRP members is reduced to $235 if the old part is sent back, according to iFixit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H28ygS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This removes a big barrier for Apple in the path to legislation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LU6wXd"&gt;While Apple says that individuals using the Self Service Repair program will receive a credit back for the old part, it’s not clear how much money you can save by taking this path, and Apple didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on the matter. In my experience as a former employee of Apple, I recall that it was also Apple Store policy to not allow customers to take back old parts from the repairs we did for them (including bad hard drives from Macs). Based on how important bad part returns seem to Apple, whatever credit Apple will offer to customers using the self-service program could be significant enough to motivate old part returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNAiXp"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/11/21/2578547/former-apple-retail-ron-johnson-interview"&gt;Ron Johnson era&lt;/a&gt; of Apple retail, I worked as a Genius repairing many Macs and early-model iPhones in an Apple retail store. While many of the repairs were expensive on paper, our employee training specifically taught us to provide some repairs for free to promote customer satisfaction, as long as devices didn’t show signs of abuse. Those policies tightened noticeably after Johnson’s departure in 2011, with John Browett taking over as SVP of Apple retail and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/no-surprise-browetts-reign-over-apple-retail-a-short-7-months/"&gt;focusing on cutting costs&lt;/a&gt;. That same year, Apple also introduced the AppleCare Plus service plan add-on for iPhones, in which accidental damage is covered after paying a $49 service fee. Despite the changes, other former employees &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/tech/apple-retail-store-trick-free-repair-replacement-tiktok-video/"&gt;have talked about how Apple’s push to “surprise and delight”&lt;/a&gt; customers can still lead to customers getting free in-store repairs. Whether that will change in the era of self-service is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4V0ePk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hope is that this will be enough to empower more DIY&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NLm56z"&gt;Normally, you could save money by buying aftermarket parts, but right now, aftermarket OLED screens for an iPhone 12 range from $279.99 (iFixit) for just the part to $329.99 (Amazon) for a full kit, which is a heavy cost. Going aftermarket also adds the risk that quality might not be as good as factory OEM pieces, and some parts could lose functionality, such as Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11256118/apple-new-ipad-price-specs-release-date"&gt;True Tone adaptive screen feature&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, customers could save money via Self Service Repair if Apple priced the parts comparable to what IRPs currently pay. However, then IRPs would lose out on business unless Apple offered them a further discount on parts compared with the self-service program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptnIVc"&gt;Another potential way individuals might use the self-service program is to stock up on parts like independent shops in the IRP program can do. Apple might choose to differentiate the IRP program and the Self Service Repair program by not allowing individuals to stock up, however, making it harder for DIY folks trying to plan ahead for devices they’ll want to repair in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KJXvsb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfjWDQOMQdU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2RSETV"&gt;In general, it’s going to be people with older phones who are more likely to need a repair, and right now, Apple’s Self Service Repair program won’t help them. iFixit CEO&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kyle Wiens notes that replacement batteries aren’t necessary for most customers until about a year and a half after the phone was purchased, when battery cells start depleting. While Wiens is overall excited about Apple’s announcement and direction, he believes that the self-service program is primarily Apple’s strategy for getting out in front of potential &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;regulatory action from FTC &lt;/a&gt;and even pressure from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787336/apple-right-to-repair-self-service-diy-reason-microsoft"&gt;its own shareholders over the right to repair&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has also been under scrutiny &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348240/apple-right-to-repair-legislation-antitrust-investigation-policy"&gt;from lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; over its restrictive repair practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pjIGB"&gt;Despite its limitations, there is hope that Apple’s new program will empower more DIY repair folks and perhaps give an opportunity to save some cash. And if a customer gets cold feet when the kit arrives, they might have another option: taking it to a local repair shop that doesn’t have access to genuine Apple parts. That shop could then charge a small fee and do the repair for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for a great Apple deal this Black Friday season, you shouldn’t shop at Apple. That’s because Apple doesn’t typically offer discounts on its new products in-store or on its website, at least outside of the occasional educational discount. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Even better, these retailers have already started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if you’re looking to save even more, make sure to check out our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re highlighting the best deals across all brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DpLcAU"&gt;The third-gen AirPods were released just last month, and now you can buy them with one of their first discounts. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422%3Fathcpid%3D510546422%26athpgid%3DAthenaHomepageDesktop__gm__1.0%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3DSeasonalCampaigns_6fe92024-377d-4272-8406-8e51842e092f_items%26athieid%3Dnull%26athstid%3DCS020%26athguid%3D2_N6KcuypFy6YyBudpQEi5znMGyVPE382o95%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are selling the true wireless earbuds for $175 instead of $179. The latest AirPods boast a MagSafe-ready charging case and shorter stems, as well as better battery life and water resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lLCckh"&gt;Apple’s second generation of true wireless earbuds, the AirPods, are selling for $119 instead of $159 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This particular model comes with a wired charging case, however, you can pick up a pair with the wireless charging case for $160 instead of $200 from &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F482532021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VqyOya"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro comes with Apple’s A12Z processor, a 120Hz display, quad speakers, and a dual-camera system with lidar. Right now, both the 11- and 12.9-inch models are on sale. Best Buy, for example, is selling the 128GB $1,149.99 LTE model of the larger version for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1P6NNP9u7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,049.99&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, you can save significantly more if you’re okay purchasing the smaller, Wi-Fi-only model — but with 265GB storage — for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1P7lnfGaJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $899.99 from Best Buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nAbiSM"&gt;The 64GB, Wi-Fi version of the 10.9-inch iPad Air is selling for $539 instead of $600 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F149437127&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in rose gold, while the space gray version is just $10 extra. Released in 2020, the latest model offers thinner bezels around the display and a Touch ID sensor embedded in the power button. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RVzOFA"&gt;Last year’s M1-equipped MacBook Air is, in our opinion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best laptop&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. Right now, you can buy Apple’s entry-level laptop for $949 instead of $999 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5KWB9H?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; when you choose the gold configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Alternatively, the 512GB model with 16GB of RAM is selling for $1,349 in gold or space gray at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604840-REG%2Fapple_z125_mgn7_04_bh_13_3_macbook_air_with.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x1080441%2FSID%2Fprice-guide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22787892%2Fapple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ULdok1"&gt;Last year’s 27-inch iMac comes with an improved 1080p webcam, as well as a notable performance increase over its predecessor. Right now, you can pick it up for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Retina-Display-27-inch-Storage/dp/B08F8ZPRGW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,699&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,799 when you choose the Core i5 model with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356416/apple-imac-27-2020-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

While a small discount, this smartwatch is a great low-cost alternative we think you should choose over the Series 3, as it has most of the features found on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17875882/new-apple-watch-series-4-review-ekg-bands-screen-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series 4&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;p id="2g6QKI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSqILT"&gt;We’ve got a well-rounded episode of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;today with everything from policy to space to consumer tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9RmQE"&gt;In the first segment, Nilay and Dieter bring in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; policy reporter Makena Kelly to talk about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;President Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure package&lt;/a&gt; and what it can do to improve broadband access in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huCavM"&gt;In segment two, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior science reporter Loren Grush joins the show to explain why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782946/russia-asat-test-satellite-international-space-station-debris"&gt;Russia destroyed one of their own satellites with a ground-based missile&lt;/a&gt; and how it’s causing concern in the space community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avvsQr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Managing editor Alex Cranz stops by in segment three to chat about Apple announcing that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787144/apple-home-repair-iphone-mac-parts-tools-instructions"&gt;will start selling manuals and tools&lt;/a&gt; for repairing certain iPhone and Mac products at home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees will return to offices February 1st in a hybrid work pilot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lG5ZOWYnElGYRkwdymZupYyprWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160990/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple employees will return to offices February 1st | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cmtF4x"&gt;Apple employees will return to offices starting February 1st as part of a hybrid work pilot and will be able to work remotely for four weeks a year. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/apple-sets-feb-1-for-return-to-office"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, employees learned of the news Thursday via an internal memo from CEO Tim Cook. The company had previously offered two weeks of remote work per year but added two more weeks to give “more opportunity to travel, be closer to your loved ones, or simply shake up your routines,” Cook’s memo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPbyzN"&gt;The pilot will start workers at one or two days in the office, then in March, workers will come to the office to work on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. They’ll be able to work from home on Wednesdays and Fridays. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-pushes-back-return-office-plan-february-rcna6026"&gt;Some employees may be asked&lt;/a&gt; to come into the office four or five days a week if their roles require more time in the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyCOxO"&gt;Cook first announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;hybrid work model in June&lt;/a&gt;, when the company was planning a September return to offices that was moved back to October, then January, and now, to February. Some Apple employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;pushed back strongly against the hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;, writing in an internal letter to Cook that they wanted a more flexible policy that allowed anyone who wanted to work from home to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzcW1d"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for more details on the company’s office return. Following widespread closures of Apple stores during the height of the pandemic in 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;reopened its retail stores&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, with mask requirements in place. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants to launch a self-driving EV in 2025 with a custom chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FVtbo2763oZyprM7_3rrzX2D04=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160939/acstro_190902_apple_event_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7XrPj"&gt;Apple has completed “much of the core work” on a new processor meant to power its secretive autonomous electric car project known as Titan, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt;. The milestone comes as Apple is reportedly now accelerating its timeline for the autonomous car it’s developing, with a new target of launching it in just four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ynw50V"&gt;Apple’s own silicon team designed the chip, which Gurman says is the “most advanced component” that’s been developed for the project so far. The company is apparently getting ready to put the chip through its real-world paces in its fleet of test vehicles in California and hopes to make a vehicle with “stronger safeguards than what’s available from Tesla and Waymo,” according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz0Qx5"&gt;The goal now for Project Titan, after multiple pivots, is to create an autonomous car that does not have a steering wheel. The interior would be spacious and look more like the limousine-style seating arrangement that EV startup Canoo has promoted in its electric van prototypes. Apple was at one point in talks to acquire Canoo, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;recently hired one of the startup’s co-founders&lt;/a&gt;. There would be a large, iPad-style touchscreen display that will run a user interface similar to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPgvES"&gt;The business model is reportedly still undecided, though. Apple has considered trying to create a self-driving fleet to compete with Uber, Lyft, and Waymo (something Tesla has proposed but is still very far from executing), but Gurman reports that the “more likely scenario” is that Apple will sell the cars to individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZlkdE"&gt;On the electric vehicle side of things, Apple is reportedly not looking to develop a proprietary charging cable for the car. Instead, it wants to make the vehicle compatible with the “combined charging system,” or CCS standard, which would make it possible to charge the vehicle at most public fast charging stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib1zFC"&gt;Of course, all of this comes after years of reported changes to the project, which was started in 2014. Five different executives have run Project Titan after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;Apple Watch lead Kevin Lynch took over earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The refocusing and timeline shift reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; could be a sign that there’s real progress being made with him at the helm, or it could just become the newest footnote in whatever the project turns into next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s new $150 3-in-1 charger is the first to get Apple Watch Series 7 fast charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qCus9mdPGv8YvNCxvFWvOMd7sQ=/125x0:1976x1234/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160686/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.40.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe | Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TxkRI0"&gt;Belkin has a pair of new wireless Apple Watch chargers it’s announcing today, which are notably the first third-party chargers to support the newly added fast charging on the Apple Watch Series 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iw8S32"&gt;The larger of the two is the $149.95 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wiz016%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22785707%2Fbelkin-apple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-magsafe-charger-boost-charge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, which follows in the footsteps of last year’s 3-in-1 Belkin charger. In addition to adding Series 7 fast charging, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;Belkin has ditched the odd sculptural design&lt;/a&gt; on the previous model in favor of a more normal-looking flat rectangular pad that will probably fit better on a nightstand. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKUMBJ0Oe14bbCcQ41uUJaZtDvA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024679/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.43.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kl7fHl"&gt;The new charger aims to hit the perfect trio of Apple charging: full-speed 15W MagSafe charging for an iPhone, Series 7 fast charging for an Apple Watch, and a regular Qi charger for the AirPods. Of course, as has always been the case with Belkin’s combination chargers, the $150 price tag is far more than what it would cost to buy individual MagSafe, fast-charging Series 7 Apple Watch, and Qi chargers, meaning that you’re paying a decent premium for style and convenience here. That price also does include a 40W power adapter, so you’re at least getting a one-stop solution for your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZK3Mgx"&gt;The other new charger here is a bit more baffling: the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wiz015%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22785707%2Fbelkin-apple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-magsafe-charger-boost-charge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which is a pop-up Apple Watch charging stand that costs $59.95. Despite the “portable” in the name, Belkin’s solo charger isn’t a battery pack-style setup for recharging an Apple Watch while you’re out and about. And even more baffling, that $60 price tag doesn’t include a power adapter: while there’s an integrated USB-C cable built into the stand, you’ll have to provide your own 20W wall adapter to actually use it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHQgQgrZSpBYCYdarKvgYBK6G-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024682/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.43.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U6DJhU"&gt;The net result is a larger, bulkier version of the fast-charging cable that Apple includes with every Apple Watch Series 7 — except that Belkin’s version costs literally twice the standalone cable’s $29 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63ZAiZ"&gt;Looking more broadly, though, is the fact that the new Belkin fast chargers show — once again — the intentional limits of Apple’s MFi program. The new chargers from Belkin are the only third-party fast chargers on the market right now, and if the pattern of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;last year’s glacial MagSafe rollout&lt;/a&gt; is anything to go by, it’ll be some time before other companies are able to get the approval (and the parts) from Apple to make other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LSmFy3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Vp3Hlv"&gt;Both the $59.95 BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch and 149.95 BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe are available to order today from Belkin and Apple’s respective websites in the US, Japan, Hong Kong, and China, with availability in more countries promised in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pay equity and harassment organizer will leave the company after reaching a settlement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XqM3nqv3p-ZADvT0eYbRAvCJlrw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157708/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TASCwe"&gt;Cher Scarlett, an Apple engineer who helped organize pay equity surveys and anti-harassment / discrimination campaigns at the company, will be leaving the company and requesting the withdrawal of a complaint she made to the National Labor Relations Board (or NLRB), &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/apple-worker-who-led-protest-movement-leaving-after-settlement?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The software engineer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1461078948436054016"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that Friday would be her last day at Apple. Scarlett’s lawyers told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that she had reached a private settlement with the company, but she declined to provide details about the terms when asked by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lECwx"&gt;Scarlett is leaving voluntarily, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, unlike some other organizers who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement"&gt;were fired from the company after speaking out&lt;/a&gt;. During her time at Apple, she &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/14/apple-worker-cher-scarlett/"&gt;was reportedly accused of leaking information to the press&lt;/a&gt; by other employees, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;that’s strongly discouraged by Apple leadership&lt;/a&gt;, and that she denies doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YRB9ez"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Friday is my last day at Apple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m taking a bit of time to decide where I’d like to go next, and will announce when I’ve made that decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett   (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1461078948436054016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nV0cDB"&gt;The charge she’s requested be withdrawn was filed in September, when Scarlett said that Apple had “engaged in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She made the complaint after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;she and others at the company struggled to conduct a pay equity survey&lt;/a&gt; for Apple employees, with the company repeatedly shutting down their attempts. Scarlett also told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that Apple wouldn’t allow employees to create a Slack room to talk about pay equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sqW6Lc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tim Cook says employees who leak memos do not belong at Apple, according to leaked memo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5l5Esy"&gt;Scarlett withdrawing her complaint won’t necessarily leave Apple in the clear — the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759715/fired-apple-too-organizer-files-labor-charge-nlrb"&gt;faces a number of other complaints&lt;/a&gt;, including ones alleging wrongful termination from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729072/apple-too-organizer-janneke-parrish-interview"&gt;other employees Scarlett worked with&lt;/a&gt; to organize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;the #AppleToo movement&lt;/a&gt;. #AppleToo aimed to get support for Apple employees who experienced discrimination or harassment if the company’s policies failed to provide it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H74v6"&gt;Scarlett’s lawyers told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that they hoped the company’s employees would continue to organize, a sentiment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729072/apple-too-organizer-janneke-parrish-interview"&gt;echoed by other activists&lt;/a&gt; that are no longer with the company. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rittenhouse defense requests a mistrial after iPhone Mail app compresses key video evidence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jury Deliberates In Kyle Rittenhouse Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W1HjlvEJ6r9EY5TzKd0ox35zngE=/0x0:5222x3481/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157401/1236627321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Krajacic - Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gC8mJP"&gt;The Kyle Rittenhouse trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin has once again gone off track because of basic technology problems: Rittenhouse’s defense attorneys today requested a mistrial because prosecutors sent them a drone video via email, which compressed the video in size. This is after earlier arguments about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775580/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-judge-apple-ai-pinch-to-zoom-footage-manipulation-claim"&gt;what pinch-to-zoom does or does not do&lt;/a&gt;, and the judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778801/kyle-rittenhouse-bruce-schroeder-screenshot-zoom-in"&gt;struggling with the screenshot features on his Galaxy S20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2bUF6"&gt;Rittenhouse faces five felony charges for shooting three men and killing two of them last year during a protest in Kenosha. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-verdict-watch-11-17-21/index.html"&gt;CNN reports&lt;/a&gt; the motion for a mistrial is focused on when and how defense attorneys received a copy of a drone video showing the shootings that was shown to the jury in open court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0md2S"&gt;Rittenhouse’s lawyers say they only received a copy of the drone video on November 5th, after the trial started, and that instead of the 11.2MB video possessed by the state, the file they received was just 3.6MB. “What that means is the video provided to the defense was not as clear as the video kept by the state,” the motion for mistrial claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfntYj"&gt;Prosecutors say they only obtained the video file directly from the drone operator after the trial started — the footage was already public, as it had aired on The Tucker Carlson Show on Fox News within days of the shooting during an appearance by the defendant’s first attorney, and a lower-quality version of the video was part of the defense’s exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kg07HA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Going from an iPhone to an Android, it appears, somehow compressed the file. We did not know that this would occur.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QxzwE2"&gt;The prosecutors said the individual who took the footage came to investigators after the trial had started and transferred a higher-quality version of the video to a detective via AirDrop. The detective brought the video to court, and minutes after his arrival the prosecution told defense attorneys that they had obtained a much better quality version of the video than was previously available. The detective emailed a copy to Rittenhouse’s attorney Natalie Wisco, who uses an Android mobile device, and she transferred that file to the defense’s laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjCQTk"&gt;Assistant District Attorney James Kraus told the court that “going from an iPhone to an Android, it appears, somehow compressed the file [...] we did not know that this would occur. We gave what we fully believed was the full file to Ms. Wisco [...] it came in without objection and was an exhibit for four days, displayed for the jury on full screen.” The prosecution says that they did not know the version she received was of lower quality until just a few days ago when Wisco displayed the file she had received on a defense laptop in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7Bjkb"&gt;The iPhone’s Mail app &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-attachments-iph8580f163b/15.0/ios/15.0"&gt;automatically compresses video files sent as an attachment&lt;/a&gt;, and the defense attorney describes getting a renamed .mov file in a format that sounds exactly like an Apple Mail-app compressed video from an iPhone user. The defense was ultimately able to retrieve the full-resolution video file after sending an attorney to collect it on a USB stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXKcch"&gt;Wisconsin defense attorney Jessa Nicholson Goetz tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that “it is not normal that video or other electronic evidence is AirDropped to defense counsel in the middle of a trial. That is &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; atypical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiVoy6"&gt;According to Goetz, Wisconsin law says that “any evidence that the state intends to use at trial must be disclosed ‘at a reasonable time before trial,’” and that “a mid-trial AirDrop in no way meets the requirements.” She also notes that prosecutors and courts in Wisconsin routinely handle video evidence. “Many police departments have body cams required, and virtually all squad cars statewide are equipped with video that turns on automatically if the vehicle’s emergency lights are activated. All of those videos are regularly provided via flash drive or CD-ROM/DVD,” says Goetz. “I have never encountered receiving a different or lower quality version of video evidence than the original video.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKtsxe"&gt;As for why the procedures for handling evidence in this case seem so sloppy, Goetz tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that evidentiary rules vary from county to county, with some courts that use online portals to transfer files back and forth, some that require mailed hard copies, and others that require prosecutors to allow defense attorneys to physically retrieve whatever files they need on USB drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XNBYV"&gt;Rittenhouse’s defense initially requested a mistrial with prejudice, which would have prevented the case from being tried again. It has dropped the “with prejudice” from the request, and so far the judge has not ruled on the motion, even as the jury deliberates and looks at the video. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-live-jurors-set-to-begin-second-day-of-deliberations/2686647/"&gt;NBC 5 News&lt;/a&gt; reports that Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder says resolving the issue will require testimony from an expert witness.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your iPhone 12 or 13 is having issues with calls, updating iOS may help</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13, in pink." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzOzZiGzLh0VtWA7ztijbsr3KgM=/0x0:2019x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156363/vpavic_210916_4760_0069.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8Gk5O"&gt;A new iOS update is starting to hit phones — no, not the seemingly feature-packed iOS 15.2, but iOS 15.1.1, which Apple says will solve an issue with calls dropping. According to the update note, the new version of iOS “improves call drop performance on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWdorh"&gt;While we haven’t seen large amounts of users complaining about their new-model iPhones dropping more calls than normal, it’s nice to see that Apple is paying attention to how its phones perform as, well, phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OWl7X5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;15.1.1 is worth updating to if you’ve been having issues with calls dropping&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igyTso"&gt;You can update to iOS 15.1.1 by going to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update. If you find updating to be a pain and haven’t been experiencing any call issues, though, it may be best to just wait for iOS 15.2 — the beta has been absolutely packed with features, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;improvements to the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;addition of the App Privacy Report&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774124/ios-15-2-beta-2-airtag-tracker-scan-privacy-invasion"&gt;manually scan for suspicious AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and more. That update seems to be coming soon, so waiting to go through the update process would be understandable, especially given that Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;not reporting any major security patches in 15.1.1.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The shareholder fight that forced Apple’s hand on repair rights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A repair tutorial from iFixit shows a user accessing the internal electronics of an iPhone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOsFCsRYONNdeXoArLCZ2tyZWA0=/0x25:592x420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155770/ifixit_teardown_iphone_13_pro.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A repair tutorial from iFixit shows a user accessing the internal electronics of an iPhone | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928?vgo_ee=3bheJeT%2FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%2BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%3D" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aANBG1"&gt;Wednesday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that the company will soon make parts and repair manuals available to the general public, reversing years of restrictive repair policies. The new policy represents a seismic shift for a company that has fought independent repair for years by restricting access to parts, manuals, and diagnostic tools, designing products that are difficult to fix, and lobbying against laws that would enshrine the right to repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHPqCC"&gt;But Apple didn’t change its policy out of the goodness of its heart. The announcement follows months of growing pressure from repair activists and regulators — and its timing seems deliberate, considering a &lt;a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-shareholder-proposal-presses-apple-to-expand-access-to-repair/"&gt;shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; environmental advocates filed with the company in September asking Apple to re-evaluate its stance on independent repair. Wednesday is a key deadline in the fight over the resolution, with advocates poised to bring the issue to the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdtzSp"&gt;Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the program “has been in development for well over a year,” describing it as “the next step in increasing customer access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and manuals.” Leahy declined to say whether the timing of the announcement was influenced by shareholder pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nffZMT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The timing is definitely no coincidence”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WLSKQt"&gt;Activist shareholders believe that it was.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The timing is definitely no coincidence,” says Annalisa Tarizzo, an advocate with Green Century, the mutual fund company that filed the right-to-repair resolution with Apple in September. As a result of today’s announcement, Green Century is withdrawing its resolution, which asked Apple to “reverse its anti repair practices” and evaluate the benefits of making parts and tools more available to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oI4PEX"&gt;That’s exactly what Apple seems to be doing with its new Self Service Repair program. Announced this morning, the program will allow members of the general public to order genuine Apple parts in order to make basic iPhone repairs at home — something Apple has long argued is too dangerous for individuals to do. According to Apple, Self Service Repair will initially focus on the display, battery, and camera for iPhone 12 and 13 models. Individuals interested in doing screen repairs or battery replacements for those models at home will be able to place an order for genuine Apple parts through a new Apple Self Service Repair Online Store, send in their old part for recycling, and receive a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MqNaBN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The announcement effectively fulfills Green Century’s request that Apple make significant changes to its repair policies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOAhiz"&gt;Apple’s announcement of the program is light on details, including whether the program will be expanded beyond iPhone 12 and 13 as well as Mac computers using M1 chips, how much genuine parts will cost customers, and whether it will eventually make parts available for a wider range of repairs. Although the announcement implies it will, Leahy declined to confirm that the program will eventually be expanded to other iPhone models. Still, the announcement effectively fulfills Green Century’s request that Apple make significant changes to its repair policies to facilitate independent repair — assuming the tech giant follows through with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byZEva"&gt;Apple’s initial response to the Green Century resolution was less than conciliatory. Tarizzo says that on October 18 (30 days before the self service announcement), Apple submitted a “no action request” to the Securities and Exchange Commission asking the investor oversight body to block the proposal. According to Tarizzo, Apple’s argument before the SEC was that the proposal — that the company “prepare a report” on the environmental and social benefits of making its devices easier to fix — ran afoul of shareholder proposal guidance by infringing on Apple’s normal business operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gHGaA"&gt;However, earlier this month, the SEC &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/staff-legal-bulletin-14l-shareholder-proposals"&gt;issued new guidance&lt;/a&gt; concerning no-action requests that includes a carve-out for proposals that raise “significant social policy issues.” In other words, shareholders &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; bring resolutions that affect a company’s day-to-day business operations if those proposals raise issues with significant societal impact. Tarizzo believes that this change made it much more likely the SEC would side with Green Century rather than Apple, particularly since the mutual fund company connected the dots between increased access to repair and the fight against climate change. (Using devices as long as possible through maintenance and repair is &lt;a href="https://debugger.medium.com/apples-new-iphone-is-far-from-green-1803f4f9a58a"&gt;one of the best ways to reduce the climate impact&lt;/a&gt; of consumer technology since the majority of the emissions associated with our gadgets occur during the manufacturing stage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1Dj9C"&gt;“It wasn’t a guarantee that the SEC would side with us, but the new guidance indicates it’s very likely we would prevail,” Tarizzo says. “It effectively took away a lot of Apple’s leverage in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jX8BDL"&gt;Now, Apple seems to have regained some leverage by announcing its new Self Service Repair program on the same day that Green Century was required to respond to the no-action request. Instead of arguing that the SEC should allow the shareholder resolution to move forward, Green Century is now withdrawing the resolution entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EpEfic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some of Apple’s biggest competitors have already embraced right-to-repair policies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZNN0P"&gt;Companies routinely ignore shareholder resolutions, and many had assumed Apple would respond to Green Century’s resolution the same way — but it came at a time of unique momentum for the right-to-repair cause. This year, a &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/half-us-states-looking-give-americans-right-repair"&gt;record 27 states&lt;/a&gt; have considered right to repair bills, and the first national right to repair bill was introduced to Congress &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/news/usp/broad-right-repair-bill-introduced-congress"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt;. None have passed into law, but they’ve sent an alarming message to companies like Apple that restrictive repair practices may not be legal for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Iwf5"&gt;That’s also resulted in pressure from the federal government. In May, the Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://grist.org/technology/should-customers-be-able-to-repair-their-devices-this-federal-agency-says-yes/"&gt;came out strongly in favor of independent repair&lt;/a&gt; with the release of a report finding “scant evidence” to justify restrictions imposed by companies like Apple. In July, President Biden himself &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the FTC to craft new regulations that would limit the ability of cell phone makers to restrict DIY repair. Those rules are a long way from coming into effect, but the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-ramp-law-enforcement-against-illegal-repair-restrictions"&gt;specter of looming regulations&lt;/a&gt; was certainly a factor in Apple’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syQVvj"&gt;Some of Apple’s biggest competitors have already embraced right-to-repair policies, adding even more pressure on the company. Last month, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to comply with a first-of-its-kind right-to-repair resolution brought by environmental nonprofit &lt;em&gt;As You Sow &lt;/em&gt;in June. The resolution asked Microsoft to study the environmental and social benefits of increasing access to repair; Microsoft not only agreed to conduct such a study but to act on the findings by the end of 2022. Microsoft’s concession to activist shareholders came on the heels of Green Century filing a similar shareholder resolution with Apple, a move activists speculated could pressure on the iPhone maker to respond in kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="niFteq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company’s about-face on independent repair is “really the product of the combined pressure of all sides of the right-to-repair movement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66i69y"&gt;The result is a huge victory for Green Century and a validation for shareholder activism more broadly. Tarizzo says that while Apple’s new program “doesn’t go all the way where we want the company to go, we think it’s a significant enough step that it warrants a withdrawal. The fact they’ll be selling common replacement parts, tools, releasing repair manuals, it’s all very much in the spirit of what we were hoping to see happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8Jw4g"&gt;While Tarizzo feels that the timing of Apple’s announcement is directly related to Green Century’s shareholder resolution, she believes the company’s about-face on independent repair is “really the product of the combined pressure of all sides of the right-to-repair movement” from federal action to statehouse bills to grassroots advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2V0KOE"&gt;Nathan Proctor, the senior right to repair campaign director at the US Public Research Interest Group, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXq9yf"&gt;“If I was to hazard a guess, it would be the whole compilation of the campaign has successfully changed Apple’s position,” Proctor tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I don’t think you can point to any one particular thing that was done that made it happen. It all made it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
