    <title>WhatsApp criticizes Apple’s new app privacy labels over iMessage inconsistency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FdqPyA2heneUL-6ea89jj6hcKZI=/6x0:1086x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483603/verge-whatsapp-notification-2040pxl.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naXIJs"&gt;WhatsApp has hit back at Apple over its new privacy labels for apps in the App Store, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/whatsapp-apple-privacy-label-requirements-cc0d5edd-ab2f-4549-b9d7-ea3c97184056.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that it’s unfair that they don’t appear to cover the pre-installed first-party service iMessage, since it’s not available on the App Store. The Facebook-owned messaging service reportedly submitted its privacy label information to Apple on Monday, and it has &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/unpacking-whatsapps-privacy-label-in-the-apple-app-store"&gt;published an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; outlining what each label means in terms of the service’s data collection, and why it needs this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwfNul"&gt;“We think labels should be consistent across first and third party apps as well as reflect the strong measures apps may take to protect people’s private information,” WhatsApp told &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;in a statement. Although it said giving users easy-to-read privacy information is “a good start,” it added that “it’s important people can compare these ‘privacy nutrition’ labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed, like iMessage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5zpyb5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s important people can compare these ‘privacy nutrition’ labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq2mbX"&gt;Apple first announced the new privacy labels feature as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;host of new privacy features at WWDC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Likening them to the nutrition labels used on packaged groceries, the company said the feature should provide app users with more information about the data being collected on them. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#main:~:text=This%20information%20will%20be%20required%20to,App%20Store%20starting%20December%208%2C%202020"&gt;As of December 8th&lt;/a&gt;, developers are required to provide the information when submitting new apps and updates, however &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;notes that it’s unclear when they’ll start appearing on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT7R75"&gt;Facebook has also been critical of other aspects of Apple’s privacy push this year, like its requirement that developers show a warning and ask for permission to collect a user’s Identification for Advertisers (IDFA) starting with iOS 14. This is an identifier which helps advertisers target their ads. In response, Facebook said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;would stop collecting IDFA information&lt;/a&gt; through its apps, in a move that would “severely impact” its ad network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYC5km"&gt;“This is not a change we want to make, but unfortunately Apple’s updates to iOS 14 have forced this decision,” Facebook said at the time, “We know this may severely impact publishers’ ability to monetize through Audience Network on iOS 14, and, despite our best efforts, may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14 in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFNAMf"&gt;Apple later announced that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delaying the launch of the privacy feature&lt;/a&gt; until “early next year” to allow developers to make the necessary changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWs4pu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAuMP3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to buy Apple’s new AirPods Max headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CfiK42iNqsVMxlGzJ_eeS-Kmsqg=/0x0:980x653/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478037/apple_airpods_max_listening_experience_12082020_big_carousel.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXTBOA"&gt;After many months of rumors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;Apple officially announced the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;, its own over-the-ear, wireless, noise-canceling headphones. This is the first pair of noise-canceling headphones to feature the Apple logo. They cost $549 and are available for preorder now with shipping slated for December 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swfJ7i"&gt;Unlike the AirPods and AirPods Pro, the AirPods Max come in multiple colors (dark gray, silver, blue, green, and pink). They feature high-fidelity audio, adaptive EQ, active noise cancellation, and spatial audio. Apple says the headphones offer a 20-hour battery life with charging done through Apple’s Lightning connector and not through a USB-C cable. (No, a charging brick does not come in the box.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzaX5q"&gt;We’ll be reviewing the new wireless headphones soon, but if you are interested in placing an order ahead of time, below are the retailers that currently have product listings available.  Currently, you can preorder the AirPods Max at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airpods%2Fairpods-max%2Fspace-gray#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726003076182366997" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-max%2F-%2FA-82065675%3Fpreselect%3D54191104%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. We expect other retailers to put up listings soon and will update this article when they do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly hands over its self-driving car project to executive who oversees Siri</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/glZ7wc-hDgvDNKQytQeIpIp8uQk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68480486/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ddwq7I"&gt;“Siri, drive my car...” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLoCLe"&gt;Apple is shuffling its leadership that oversees its secretive self-driving car project, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/apple-shifts-leadership-of-self-driving-car-division-to-ai-chief?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The team’s engineers will now report to John Giannandrea, the company’s head of artificial intelligence, who also oversees voice-based digital assistant Siri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJGTz4"&gt;Giannandrea, Google’s former head of search and artificial intelligence, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17195076/google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-joining-apple-machine-learning-siri"&gt;joined Apple in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. His hire was seen as a huge get for Apple, which has struggled for years to make progress in fast-moving and increasingly important AI fields like computer vision and natural language processing. Giannandrea reports directly to CEO Tim Cook as the leader of machine learning and AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="txAEHk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not much is known about Apple’s so-called Project Titan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iCwL67"&gt;Not much is known about Apple’s so-called Project Titan. Unlike most of its competitors, the company has been frustratingly tight-lipped regarding the self-driving cars it’s testing in California. After beginning with the aim of developing a purpose-built self-driving car, the plans were later scaled back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/17/13303710/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-focus"&gt;just developing software&lt;/a&gt;, with Apple partnering with car manufacturers such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387214/apple-volkswagen-partnership-self-driving-cars-project-titan"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; to provide the hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdG6JF"&gt;There has also been legal drama. In 2019, an Apple employee who is a Chinese citizen was accused by the FBI of attempting to steal trade secrets related to the company’s autonomous car project. It was the second time the government has charged an Apple employee for trying to steal self-driving secrets in the last seven months. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195598/apple-project-titan-200-employees-dismissed"&gt;laid off about 200 employees from the project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOmsjX"&gt;In June 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;Apple acquired the struggling self-driving startup Drive.ai&lt;/a&gt;. Apple purchased the company’s assets, including its autonomous cars, and hired many of its engineers away from Drive.ai directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wotXIB"&gt;Earlier this year, Apple filed a report with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that showed the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21142685/california-dmv-self-driving-car-disengagement-report-data"&gt;seriously downgraded&lt;/a&gt; its public road testing in 2019. After driving nearly 80,000 miles in 2018, the company only logged 7,544 miles in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3lNzO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s new Circle View Wired Doorbell is the first to support HomeKit Secure Video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/37zrbrLX1IEHZRskLwbQfrO7-fc=/189x0:2292x1402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479647/Screen_Shot_2020_12_08_at_1.43.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgILyD"&gt;Logitech has quietly revealed a new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHPGS2VC%2FA%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163585%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Circle View Wired Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; camera today, which is notably the first consumer smart doorbell to support Apple’s recent HomeKit Secure Video standard. The new doorbell is available from both Apple and Logitech’s websites for $199.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68qgFf"&gt;Apple first debuted the HomeKit Secure Video standard in 2019, but it’s taken some time for developers to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fhome%2Faccessories%2F%23section-camera&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163585%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adopt the system&lt;/a&gt;. Logitech’s new Circle View Wired Doorbell is the first doorbell camera to offer it, at least on a consumer level (technically, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes, the Robin ProLine camera beat Logitech to the punch, although that product is designed for commercial customers rather than home installations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmT0TT"&gt;As for the camera itself, it’s designed to exclusively work with Apple’s HomeKit system (so no Alexa or Google Nest support). The Circle View Wired Doorbell offers a 160-degree DFOV from a 5-megapixel sensor that shoots 1200 x 1600 video in HDR. There’s also an integrated light strip for nighttime that can light up to show visitors up to six feet away, along with color night vision. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mvdHmgY56ZZ41DoXrj0u2vDRywc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154964/HPGS2_AV4.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5a5ClF"&gt;HomeKit Secure Video allows for Logitech to outsource most of the actual “security camera” side of things to Apple’s software, using the Apple Home app to notify users when visitors are outside. It also uses Apple’s iCloud service for streaming, storing, and sharing video recordings, and Apple TV or HomePod devices function as main processing hubs for determining when people or vehicles are outside and for running &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/face-recognition-iph04af43727/ios"&gt;Apple’s face recognition feature&lt;/a&gt; (based on your photo library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rF8jmU"&gt;The Circle View Wired Doorbell camera is available for $199.99 (with Logitech also offering a $299.99 bundle that includes home installation through its website). To take full advantage of the HomeKit functionality, though, customers will also need a HomePod mini, HomePod, iPad, or Apple TV to serve as a HomeKit hub, as well as an iCloud storage plan for saving videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe releases Arm version of Lightroom for Windows and macOS </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jfq2Uw1xX4tufNM_y3d5B5-asg0=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477312/adobelightroom.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JvwjHG"&gt;Adobe is releasing an Arm version of Lightroom for both macOS and Windows today. The latest version of Lightroom is now native for both Apple M1 systems and Qualcomm-powered Windows 10 devices. It’s debuting as a full release, rather than a beta version and Adobe is making it part of the regular Creative Suite installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyxEn8"&gt;While this native Arm version is the new version of Lightroom, if you’re a fan of the classic Lightroom then you’ll need to wait a little longer for Adobe to ship it. “We intend to ship Apple M1 native versions as soon as they are ready, so stay tuned,” &lt;a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/2020/12/08/december-photography-updates.html#gs.myqpo5"&gt;says Sharad Mangalick&lt;/a&gt;, a program manager on the photography team at Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bx1XYM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adobe has also released a beta version of Photoshop for Arm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PAXcCY"&gt;This latest update to Lightroom comes just weeks after Adobe shipped a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571070/adobe-photoshop-arm64-beta-windows-macos-m1"&gt;beta version of Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; that supports M1 Macs and Arm-based Windows PCs. As it’s still in beta, Photoshop is missing a number of key features, but today’s Lightroom release keeps all the features you’d expect on the desktop version. It has essentially been ported across to Arm, with all of its existing features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ko3huq"&gt;Adobe says it plans to keep optimizing for Arm and M1 devices in future releases, so we’ll likely see additional Creative Suite apps arrive with Arm support soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus will launch on December 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uimffs3n1OlBFnHAFiyTqKdDsGs=/58x0:1903x1230/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477295/Apple_fitness_plus_screens_appletv_ipadpro_applewatch_iphone11_09152020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ztT7Cb"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus — the company’s new workout program service — is set to launch on December 14th, the company announced today. The subscription service is set to cost $9.99 per month (or $79.99 per year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PptfBG"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus was announced earlier this year as Apple’s latest attempt to continue to bolster its subscription offers, and it will feature Peloton-style guided workouts that can be viewed on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, while utilizing an Apple Watch for tracking workout metrics as you go. The service will launch with 10 workout types: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), strength, yoga, dance, core, cycling, treadmill (for both running and walking), rowing, and “mindful cooldown.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ere22"&gt;According to the company, “many Fitness Plus workouts require no equipment at all or just a set of dumbbells,” while the more equipment-based cycling, treadmill, and rowing workouts should be doable with almost any bike, treadmill, or rowing machine that users have. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3nCisE5NIaOLbY2BlIf334-fixQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154260/Screen_Shot_2020_12_08_at_8.49.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X6ABVY"&gt;Like other popular workout services, Apple will offer a variety of trainers who will guide users through each workout (and, like Peloton, Apple is clearly hoping that the cult of personality that has sprung up around the trainers for the popular bike service will benefit its service, too. The company is already curating &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/applefitnessplus/"&gt;Instagram pages&lt;/a&gt; for each trainer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSumks"&gt;Notably, the Apple Watch metrics are so key to Apple Fitness Plus that you’ll be required to have one of Apple’s smartwatches (specifically, an Apple Watch Series 3 or newer) to use the service, along with an iPhone to configure and pair it. You’ll also be able to view the workouts on a larger screen using an iPad or Apple TV, should you own one, but they’re not mandatory like the Apple Watch and iPhone requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afUqck"&gt;Apple is looking to goose the start of Fitness Plus by offering customers who have bought an Apple Watch Series 3 (or newer) three free months of Fitness Plus, while existing Apple Watch users will be able to get a free one-month trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAjygA"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus, in addition to the standalone subscription, is also available as part of Apple’s top $29.95-per-month Apple One Premier plan, which includes Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, and 2TB of iCloud storage that can all be shared by up to six users. But even the regular Apple Fitness Plus plan (for $9.99 per month) includes Apple’s Family Sharing support, meaning that up to six family members can access the subscription for the same $9.99-per-month price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces $549 AirPods Max noise-canceling headphones, coming December 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nk2nfTOSptfhCd--AuCkX9K7BRE=/0x6:1876x1257/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477258/Screen_Shot_2020_12_08_at_8.39.47_AM.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j0oG5H"&gt;It turns out Apple has one more major hardware announcement before 2020 comes to a close: after many months of rumors, Apple today unveiled its own over-ear noise-canceling headphones. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fairpods-max%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F21438042%2Fapple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;They’re called the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;, and they come with the premium design that’s expected from flagship Apple headphones. They also come with an extremely premium $549 price and are set to go on sale on December 15th. Preorders start today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbQL2p"&gt;The AirPods Max come in five colors: space gray, silver, sky blue, green, and pink. They feature what Apple calls a “custom acoustic design” with a 40mm driver system “that provides rich, deep bass, accurate mid-ranges, and crisp, clean high-frequency extension so every note can be heard.” Apple has brought over a number of features that first debuted in the AirPods line, like adaptive EQ, transparency mode, spatial audio, and audio sharing. There’s even an element from the Apple Watch — the Digital Crown — that has made its way to these headphones. Apple says it “offers precise volume control and the ability to play or pause audio, skip tracks, answer or end phone calls, and activate Siri.” There’s also a separate “noise control” button for switching between noise-canceling and transparency modes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwjoyjcuwzLattt4rmqdY7SEJjE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154283/Screen_Shot_2020_12_08_at_9.01.18_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="slbOeH"&gt;As for the design, here’s what Apple says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0KiERv"&gt;The breathable knit mesh canopy, spanning the headband, is made to distribute weight and reduce on-head pressure. The stainless steel headband frame provides strength, flexibility, and comfort for a wide variety of head shapes and sizes. Telescoping headband arms smoothly extend and stay in place to maintain the desired fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCwr3m"&gt;Each ear cup attaches to the headband through a revolutionary mechanism that balances and distributes ear cup pressure, and allows it to independently pivot and rotate to fit the unique contours of a user’s head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0awrWv"&gt;None of that sounds particularly “revolutionary” when stacked up next to other high-end noise-canceling headphones, but the memory foam ear cushions should make for good comfort. They’re also removable and attach via magnets, so hopefully replacing them won’t be too much trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/soEqF1hF8KhlZKaGYHiThB6gsmM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154362/magnets.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X7EPJu"&gt;The AirPods Max offer 20-hour battery life and charge over Apple’s Lightning connector — not USB-C. (Apple has a sold-separately &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMR2C2AM%2FA%2Flightning-to-35mm-audio-cable-12m&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F21438042%2Fapple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 Lightning to 3.5mm cable&lt;/a&gt; for wired listening.) If you’re in a hurry, a five-minute charge gets you 90 minutes of playback time. The headphones automatically pause audio when removed from your ears and resume playback when you put them back on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsbg7H"&gt;There’s also a “smart case” for the AirPods Max (below) that automatically puts them into a low-power state. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem that Apple is selling a more protective hardshell case at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSfDAjFwIMhvvsxzBdLeLNJPs88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154295/Screen_Shot_2020_12_08_at_9.15.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8tOH07"&gt;Similar to approaches from Bose, Sony, and others, Apple’s noise-cancellation system produces anti-noise to hush external sound by using six outward-facing microphones. Two inward-facing mics measure what you’re hearing to cancel out additional distractions. Apple also claims the AirPods Max perform well for voice calls (even in windy conditions) with their built-in beamforming mics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7btWT8JGy1YJ8EUAg5E82_Ka2nA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154275/AirPodsMax.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xma35q"&gt;By moving into the premium headphones space, Apple will directly compete with brands like Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, AKG, Bowers and Wilkins, and others that have years of experience and a long list of products between them. Apple is going higher than just about all of them on price, but the company is riding the momentum of the AirPods and AirPods Pro, which have dominated the true wireless earbuds market. My biggest question is whether the sound quality can live up to the price. For much less, you can get the Sony 1000XM4, which support LDAC, a wireless audio codec that isn’t too far off from CD quality. There’s no equivalent for this on iPhone, and Apple Music still only offers lossy AAC audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xuoFW"&gt;Still, Apple has taken impressive advantage of the synergy between its hardware by introducing features like automatic device switching — the AirPods Max, AirPods, and select Beats products can switch between an iPhone, Mac, and iPad based on whichever one you’re currently using — and, in the case of the AirPods Max and Pro, a capability called spatial audio that replicates an immersive surround sound experience when watching movies and TV shows on an iPhone or iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgzfBs"&gt;Apple’s Beats brand also sells higher-end headphones, including the Solo Pro and Studio 3 Wireless, both of which feature active noise cancellation. More recently, with Apple firmly covering consumers invested in its ecosystem, Beats has shown a renewed interest in appealing to Android device owners; the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Beats Flex earbuds&lt;/a&gt; have a USB-C connector instead of Apple’s proprietary Lightning port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvWbuS"&gt;Early December is an unusually late time of year for Apple to introduce new products. Today’s news was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/03/applecare-memo-potential-hardware-announcement/"&gt;tipped last week by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that Apple had sent out a memo to authorized service providers about imminent changes to AppleCare. In the days since, the long-in-the-works headphones have been viewed as the most likely candidate. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now use Waze on CarPlay’s home screen instead of flipping between apps while driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo showing CarPlay Dashboard with Waze showing directions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1EO1ZuMtd6WBDDy3fg3DBYbs80=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476259/20201208_Mitchell_Clark_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hlh2tm"&gt;If you use Waze and ever needed to take your eyes off the road to control your music alongside your maps, a new update is starting to roll out that should let you spend more time driving and less time fiddling with that touchscreen. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; is reporting that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/06/waze-carplay-dashboard-goes-live/"&gt;Waze has started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; Apple CarPlay Dashboard support, which will allow you to see directions on CarPlay’s home screen, alongside media controls, calendar events, and more. When I heard about it, I ran out to my car and sure enough, Waze’s directions showed up on the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Apple CarPlay with Waze directions on the left half and top right of the screen, and media controls in the bottom left" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ovvaa1ZZonqS_DZccSkQ065K3gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22153560/IMG_0241.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Waze directions and music controls, all on one screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cUVvUV"&gt;The company started beta testing the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591151/waze-carplay-split-view-dashboard-apple"&gt;late last month&lt;/a&gt;, but CarPlay Dashboard has been around for Apple Maps users since the launch of iOS 13 (though it’s only been open to third-party developers since iOS 13.4). The integration is a win for driving safety, as the golden rule for car UI is basically “look at and touch the screen as little as you possibly can.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwyfBf"&gt;Before this update, if you wanted to change the song that was playing, you’d have to go to the Music app, press the next button, then make your way back to Waze. That could be anywhere from 3 to 6 taps on the screen, depending on if Waze was in the app launcher on the side. That’s a lot, especially if you’re going 70 miles an hour. Now, you can have both Waze, the next turn you need to take, and the music controls on the same screen, and changing the song will only take one tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cYiwL"&gt;In keeping with the safety theme, the update also includes lane guidance, a feature that lets you know in advance what lane you should be in for your next turn or freeway exit. This should help reduce those “I have to be four lanes over in a quarter mile” moments that trip me up on occasion. Happy (and safe) driving!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-429" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $129 or $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725261146929567782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725328034162471061" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHjw-MSSOE9krvMa6cC9qYmHU9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15993019/akrales_190327_3315_0004.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724675251539044953" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-23" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The best deal right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon, which has the Apple’s flagship earbuds for $199&lt;/a&gt;. If that deal sells out, you can currently get them at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo for $220&lt;/a&gt; or for $234 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724966188075813300" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. There are currently three models to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4vnkg"&gt;The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. The three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E67sPx"&gt;Regardless of which model you choose, all three models support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at the Watch SE, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. But for those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal itself. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GXmAb3"&gt;A current deal available for the Apple Watch SE is the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900256762314827" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm size with GPS for $259&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off) at Best Buy. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900395414293919" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm with GPS is also on sale for $20&lt;/a&gt; off at Best Buy, bringing the price down to $289.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhhPdM"&gt;If you are looking for the GPS and cellular configuration, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900657775317077" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has the 40mm size for $309&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking for the 44mm size (plus cellular) Amazon has select colors on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-Cellular-44mm/dp/B08J5SFGQQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $320 (usually $359) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or you can buy this model at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900565456393275" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $339&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The latest high-end model of the Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect the blood oxygen levels in your body.&lt;/p&gt;

Best Buy also has a sale on the 40mm &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900844461171213" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series 6, knocking $30 off&lt;/a&gt; its normal retail price of $399. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMKKL1"&gt;Amazon has the 44mm size (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5P53JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5V1YWL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white only&lt;/a&gt;) for $399, which is how much the 40mm size normally costs. If you are looking for more color band options, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725901169577600920" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has the 44mm size with GPS also on sale for $399&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
