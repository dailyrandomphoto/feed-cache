    <title>Apple’s privacy-focused Private Relay feature isn’t coming to China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FCCcszVbQIMAVAczbYw8rwNtDus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420969/acastro_180227_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RyoW5M"&gt;Apple’s new Private Relay feature, which is designed to obscure users’ browsing data and protect their privacy, won’t be available in China, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apples-new-private-relay-feature-will-not-be-available-china-2021-06-07/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature was announced during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference as part of a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;subscription bundle called iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Other countries where Private Relay won’t be available include: Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2Cbi9"&gt;The move is the latest concession Apple has made in order to offer its services in China, a market which &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes accounts for almost 15 percent of its revenue. Chinese citizens’ access to the internet is heavily regulated, and there is restricted access to technologies like virtual private networks, or VPNs, which help citizens evade tracking and bypass censorship. It’s worth noting that Apple isn’t itself calling Private Relay a VPN, citing technicalities in how it operates, but the service protects users’ privacy in a similar way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3VNHGP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;China is one of ten countries not getting the feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TcNs4M"&gt;In 2018, Apple started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/26/17052802/apple-icloud-encryption-keys-storage-china"&gt;storing some iCloud encryption keys in China&lt;/a&gt; and transferred its Chinese iCloud operations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/28/17055088/apple-chinese-icloud-accounts-government-privacy-speed"&gt;to a firm located in China&lt;/a&gt;. Although Apple said the move would improve the “&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/10/apple-will-begin-storing-chinese-customer-icloud-data-at-new-china-data-center-from-next-month/"&gt;speed and reliability of iCloud,&lt;/a&gt;” critics said it would also let Chinese authorities access user data through the country’s legal system. The previous year, Apple removed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/29/16062172/apple-chinese-app-store-vpn-censorship-crackdown"&gt;several major VPN apps&lt;/a&gt; from its App Store in China in response to local regulations requiring VPN providers to have a government license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IRER6"&gt;According to Apple, Private Relay encrypts a user’s traffic and sends it through two internet relays in such a way that no entity can see the contents of a user’s browsing data. A first Apple-controlled relay assigns a user an anonymous IP address, while a second third-party relay decrypts the web address and forwards the data on to its destination. Apple says Private Relay hides a user’s traffic from ISPs, advertisers, and even Apple itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Apple’s Siri blaze through requests with on-device processing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PTjC3qGo-lVdNte0jv5Cyho9MHA=/223x0:2464x1494/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420125/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_4.20.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a7EPcG"&gt;During the privacy segment of WWDC, Apple talked about moving Siri’s processing from the cloud onto your device, using the “Neural Engine” built into Apple silicon. While having the voice processing happen on your phone instead of one of Apple’s servers is obviously better for privacy, it can also help speed up performance and reliability, as Apple showed off in its demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i0d9M0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Siri_on_Device|102461" data-volume-uuid="fe0397997" data-volume-id="102461" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-131" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power of on-device learning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kKbVYO"&gt;Now let’s see how fast it is when I try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="35k77u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's the same Siri demo Apple did, but without on-device processing &lt;a href="https://t.co/wLivWJa06p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wLivWJa06p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1402060984739500048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tNhEBc"&gt;Compared to my demo, Apple’s is decidedly more snappy — partially because I don’t have to deactivate Airplane Mode each time I turn it on. (My phone still requires an internet connection for the requests that come after, but the on-device model doesn’t.) Full disclosure: my demo took a few takes, and the first few times the phone did warn me that turning on Airplane Mode would make Siri inaccessible, and I had to tap the switch that turns it off, since I couldn’t do it with my voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLXOZp"&gt;Apple processing Siri requests on-device should help its users be more confident about the privacy of their data: back in 2019, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8932064/apple-siri-private-conversation-recording-explanation-alexa-google-assistant"&gt;contractors were listening to some Siri requests&lt;/a&gt;, something that wouldn’t happen if those requests were being handled by your phone alone. While Apple eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836760/apple-apology-siri-audio-recordings-privacy-changes-contractors"&gt;tried to make that situation right&lt;/a&gt; by being more transparent and making Siri recordings opt-in, handling more Siri requests on the phone is a good way to make the service a little more trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple may have done the coolest drag and drop demo ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vbgrOPtzSha9-HPDM1b-B_rOoSk=/219x0:2472x1502/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420000/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.07.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DnqUki"&gt;At today’s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021#comments"&gt;showed off its new version of macOS&lt;/a&gt;, and with it a feature called Universal Control, which lets you use your Mac’s mouse or trackpad to control the cursor on an iPad or another Mac’s screen, reaching into and across multiple devices. On paper it doesn’t sound that groundbreaking, but Craig Federighi did something really cool during the demo: he moved his cursor onto an iPad, then clicked on a photo and dragged it across two other computers to drop it into a Final Cut timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sJQBvt"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Drag_And_Drop_Demo|102462" data-volume-uuid="d15336f46" data-volume-id="102462" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-109" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature is called Universal Control, and could be incredible if it actually works this well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWTb9E"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Foptions%2Fpage%2Fflow-multi-device-control&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523322%2Fapple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s Flow&lt;/a&gt; and programs like &lt;a href="https://symless.com/synergy"&gt;Synergy&lt;/a&gt; have similarly allowed users to easily jump between computers, it’s usually not this impressive in real life — some solutions require special hardware, some don’t support actually dragging and dropping, and some have complicated setups. Apple’s version seems seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqP3qM"&gt;It is worth noting that, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523322%2Fapple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt;, there are a few small caveats for Universal Control — it will only work with three devices (so Apple was showing its full capabilities in this demo), and it won’t work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523116/apple-ios-ipados-15-watchos-8-macos-monterey-wwdc-2021"&gt;every device getting the new versions of macOS and iPadOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWU90M"&gt;Here’s the list of Macs can initiate Universal Control:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AwsDZf"&gt;MacBook Pro (2016 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v0RuhF"&gt;MacBook (2016 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YFdhnx"&gt;MacBook Air (2018 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="97MVZg"&gt;iMac (2017 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z9rufZ"&gt;iMac (5K Retina 27-inch, Late 2015)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ekWpqQ"&gt;Mac mini (2018 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2hijKT"&gt;iMac Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NTw2Sn"&gt;Mac Pro 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zCaeNQ"&gt;As for iPads, it’ll work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="k0tMIM"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qGXx8i"&gt;iPad Air (3rd generation and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XfIcyX"&gt;iPad (6th generation and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WwSl4n"&gt;iPad mini (5th generation and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5Hybx8"&gt;While the feature does work with iPads, it has to be initiated on the Mac — if you were hoping to sling a file over to your Mac using an Apple Pencil or your finger, you’re out of luck (as fun as that sounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wruU5g"&gt;Apple says the feature doesn’t require any setup (besides having your two devices being logged in with the same Apple ID and having Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Handoff turned on), but until we actually use it there’s no way to know how quick and reliable it might be. Will it work every single time you set your iPad down next to your iMac, or will you find yourself tapping your fingers on the desk waiting for them to realize that they should be communicating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIJyoQ"&gt;Obviously we’ll have to see how Universal Control works in real life, but the demo makes it seem like everything, as the saying goes, just works — Federighi brought the computers close to each other, and could hop between keyboards, mice, and screens. It makes for an incredible demo, which hints at the eternal dream of computing: being able to just use all your devices together, no matter their form factor or OS (though, of course, this version of the dream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"&gt;ignores non-Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new App Store guidelines put scammers and bounty hunters on notice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ek2fG15nxoop_N9tul87JjPv-hU=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69419904/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gZfJNX"&gt;Apple has just updated &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"&gt;its App Store Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, the document that tells iPhone and iPad developers what kind of behavior the company will tolerate and where it’s likely to reject apps or crackdown after the fact — and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/"&gt;as TechCrunch reports&lt;/a&gt;, many of today’s changes are aimed directly at scammers and fraudsters who prey on Apple users. But not all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BClSYl"&gt;I just put the entire thing through a diff checker to show you exactly what’s changed. &lt;a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/xwG6ItKe"&gt;Check out all the differences here&lt;/a&gt; for yourself, or read on for the highlights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fZ5PXa"&gt;Apple is warning fraudsters it’s coming for their entire accounts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="31KzO4"&gt;Apple already had a section titled “5.6 Developer Code of Conduct” that warned devs not to “prey on users or attempt to rip off customers” among a laundry list of other bad behavior. Now, it also includes two clear warnings and a possibility of redemption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GmaUjZ"&gt;Repeated manipulative or misleading behavior or other fraudulent conduct will lead to your removal from the Apple Developer Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj7GKi"&gt;Your Developer Program account will be terminated if you engage in activities or actions that are not in accordance with the Developer Code of Conduct. To restore your account, you may provide a written statement detailing the improvements you plan to make. If your plan is approved by Apple and we confirm the changes have been made, your account may be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OsdV8m"&gt;Apple will count slippery identities, fake reviews, negative reviews, and other warning signs against a developer’s standing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="We2Way"&gt;These three sections of the Developer Code of Conduct are brand-new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5.6.2"&gt;5.6.2 Developer Identity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2h8jt"&gt;Providing verifiable information to Apple and customers is critical to customer trust. Your representation of yourself, your business, and your offerings on the App Store must be accurate. The information you provide must be truthful, relevant, and up-to-date so that Apple and customers understand who they are engaging with and can contact you regarding any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5.6.3"&gt;5.6.3 Discovery Fraud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M767K2"&gt;Participating in the App Store requires integrity and a commitment to building and maintaining customer trust. Manipulating any element of the App Store customer experience such as charts, search reviews, or referrals to your app erodes customer trust and is not permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5.6.4"&gt;5.6.4 App Quality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMnmrY"&gt;Customers expect the highest quality from the App Store, and maintaining high quality content, services, and experiences promotes customer trust. Indications that this expectation is not being met include excessive customer reports about concerns with your app, such as negative customer reviews, and excessive refund requests. Inability to maintain high quality may be a factor in deciding whether a developer is abiding by the Developer Code of Conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="T9xo1B"&gt;Misleading marketing is also not allowed, up to and including bait-and-switch pricing. These bolded parts of section 2.3.1 are new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bSCaos"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marketing your app in a misleading way, such as by promoting&lt;/strong&gt; content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners) &lt;strong&gt;or promoting a false price, whether within or outside of the App Store, is grounds for removal of your app from the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;App Store&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and termination of your developer account.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mscnuT"&gt;All of this seems directly aimed at Apple’s scam problem, where the most profitable company in the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;hasn’t managed to stop egregious scams that are so obvious you could easily find them yourself&lt;/a&gt;, and where &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/06/apple-app-store-scams-fraud/"&gt;found 2 percent of the company’s top grossing apps were fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s unclear whether enforcement will improve alongside these new rules. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;apparently didn’t get an answer to that in its briefing with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s8VjOY"&gt;Bounty hunter apps are on notice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2vmqfs"&gt;Remember when Citizen’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447446/citizen-app-internal-slack-palisades-fire-arson-bounty-manhunt-los-angeles"&gt;encouraged his users to hunt down an innocent person by offering a $30,000 reward?&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s new rule seems designed to tamp down on vigilante justice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jzFXD4"&gt;1.7 Reporting Criminal Activity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Lt4Pz"&gt;Apps for reporting alleged criminal activity must involve local law enforcement, and can only be offered in countries where such involvement is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="y3iPC8"&gt;Hookup apps are also on notice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CopHmF"&gt;I’m not sure which app made the headlines this time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4672800/bang-with-friends-returns-ios-app-store-down"&gt;but Apple’s tangled with this issue&lt;/a&gt; in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WNB1rb"&gt;1.1.4 Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined by Webster’s Dictionary as “explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.” &lt;strong&gt;This includes “hookup” apps that may include pornography or be used to facilitate prostitution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="F6tnLX"&gt;Legal weed is OK, but it’s gotta be legal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JXfBvo"&gt;Weed apps have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/13/8032867/massroots-back-in-app-store"&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;-and-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21274431/pax-web-app-era-controls-apple-store-ban"&gt;go&lt;/a&gt; on iPhone for many years, and not for lack of rules. This is more about letting developers know that a certain narrowly defined category is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ehneBs"&gt;(ix) Apps that provide services in highly-regulated fields (such as banking and financial services, healthcare, gambling, &lt;strong&gt;legal cannabis use&lt;/strong&gt;, and air travel) or that require sensitive user information should be submitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer. &lt;strong&gt;Apps that facilitate the legal sale of cannabis must be geo-restricted to the corresponding legal jurisdiction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="enJ7Tx"&gt;You don’t need to give Apple a cut of physical gift card sales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TuvjUR"&gt;Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440629/apple-app-store-physical-purchases-400-billion-50-million-wwdc"&gt;it doesn’t take a cut of physical purchases&lt;/a&gt;. Were physical gift cards an exception? Either way, you don’t have to pay now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="RsQnA1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital&lt;/strong&gt; gift cards, certificates, vouchers, and coupons which can be redeemed for digital goods or services can only be sold in your app using in-app purchase. &lt;strong&gt;Physical gift cards that are sold within an app and then mailed to customers may use payment methods other than in-app purchase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pal2sA"&gt;Apple’s most arbitrary rules aren’t gone, but tamped down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Tpj2U8"&gt;Of all the rules in the App Store, the “don’t include irrelevant information” is probably the easiest to abuse; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;developers like ProtonMail have told us&lt;/a&gt; it’s used to justify removing an app when there aren’t any actually relevant rules. It also irks developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405140/apple-rejects-facebook-update-30-percent-cut"&gt;who believe they should be able to tell their users&lt;/a&gt; about the hoops they have to jump through to get into the store. It’s not gone, but it’s shorter now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZcitE5"&gt;2.3.10 Make sure your app is focused on the &lt;strong&gt;iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS&lt;/strong&gt; experience, and don’t include names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms in your app or metadata, unless there is specific, approved interactive functionality. Make sure your app metadata is focused on the app itself and its experience. Don’t include irrelevant information, &lt;s&gt;&lt;strong&gt;including but not limited to information about Apple or the development process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NEFvAI"&gt;Also, Apple’s clearer now that — with certain kinds of apps, and outside the app itself, and only if you get their contact info elsewhere somehow — developers actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; tell their users that they can pay outside of Apple’s store:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rO4nkx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developers cannot use information obtained within the app to target individual users outside of the app to use purchasing methods other than in-app purchase (such as sending an individual user an email about other purchasing methods after that individual signs up for an account within the app). Developers can send communications outside of the app to their user base about purchasing methods other than in-app purchase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WMJC8f"&gt;That doesn’t fix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;the company’s anti-steering rules in the least, which came up prominently during the Epic-Apple trial,&lt;/a&gt; but it does make edge cases clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kxWOm8"&gt;Apple wants apps to let users be free&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="DUkFJK"&gt;5.1.1 (v) Account Sign-In: If your app doesn’t include significant account-based features, let people use it without a login. &lt;strong&gt;If your app supports account creation, you must also offer account deletion within the app.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tYwJs9"&gt;Neat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tVl89j"&gt;Oh, and Roblox is still totally not a game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="c3kFx4"&gt;This section is all-new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1.2.1"&gt;1.2.1 Creator Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4YwhV"&gt;Apps which feature content from a specific community of users called “creators” are a great opportunity if properly moderated. These apps present a singular, unified experience for customers to interact with various kinds of creator content. They offer tools and programs to help this community of non-developer creators to author, share, and monetize user-generated experiences. These experiences must not change the core features and functionality of the native app—rather, they add content to those structured experiences. These experiences are not native “apps” coded by developers—they are content within the app itself and are treated as user-generated content by App Review. Such creator content may include video, articles, audio, and even casual games. The App Store supports apps offering such user-generated content so long as they follow all Guidelines, including Guideline 1.2 for moderating user-generated content and Guideline 3.1.1 for payments and in-app purchases. Creator apps should share the age rating of the highest age-rated creator content available in the app, and communicate to users which content requires additional purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7CBbOt"&gt;If you’re wondering what Apple is on about here, here’s the TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaCl0b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Apple doesn’t want to allow cloud gaming services like Stadia and xCloud into the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, so it told everyone each game in a collection of games had to be individually approved — even though that rule didn’t exist until Apple retroactively added it. Then everyone pointed out Roblox is a collection of games that weren’t individually approved, LOL. Apple argued at trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;that Roblox isn’t a game&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;Roblox amusingly agreed&lt;/a&gt;. Now Apple is now carving out a brand new category of “Creator Content” to cement why Roblox is OK, while other game platforms that contain multitudes are not. Simple!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Series 6 is one of many Apple Watches currently on sale ahead of Prime Day. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and cellular connectivity, which starts at $399. If that seems too expensive, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which also launched in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3 beyond the introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZqOTAE"&gt;The highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bRFJnd"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3 (38mm, GPS): $169 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793219252543422" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$199&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lREHEL"&gt;Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS): $269 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_xzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkBwh-RgExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DxzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkBwh-RgExnTVM0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals060721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$279&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BR7xFN"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm, GPS): $329 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793385278132874" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; ($&lt;s&gt;399&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent price. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE and Series 6 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793219252543422" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, both &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-42mm-Silver-Aluminium/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6Xq5N5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"The best deals on Apple MacBooks right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the Series 6, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s flagship, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikPbUG"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version of the SE for $269 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for the larger GPS model, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F168696232%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also have several color configurations of the 44mm model for $299, a 4-percent discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwogLj"&gt;If you are looking for the 40mm model with GPS, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red version for $329&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. It’s also currently available in several colors at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793385278132874" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7LoAo"&gt;If you prefer the larger model, the 44mm GPS configuration is also currently discounted to $359 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, again, assuming you don’t mind the red version. You can also pick it up in a range of different colors at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-Regular%2F896099320%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793655975172725" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $359.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the devices that can run iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-rF8LPAZzq3_9X_1RzAsmkqVTLQ=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418992/887_2021_06_07_887_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll get some fancy, new features, if you have the right devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YGREFX"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; software at WWDC 2021. The public beta period will begin in July, and whether you’re curious to download them then, or just waiting for the final release, you’ll need to have the right hardware to do it. Apple usually eliminates support for a few devices each year as it leaps ahead with major software releases, so you’ll want to check below to see if your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or computer makes the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oph3LR"&gt;For iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, Apple is extending support for all iPhone models that currently have iOS 14, along with the seventh-generation iPod Touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eINVCX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple WWDC 2021: the 15 biggest announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RjIx6e"&gt;Here’s the list of supported devices for iOS 15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4rqkT"&gt;iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4MYuU8"&gt;iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWbtK7"&gt;iPhone X, iPhone XR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gPzYC"&gt;iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xXbea7"&gt;iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CrMC2z"&gt;iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WTQtvI"&gt;iPhone SE (first and second generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jl56Ou"&gt;iPod Touch (seventh generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Msw5NFDQVFvpg60vzONxAhdDZqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643174/766_2021_06_07_766_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lfarV7"&gt;Now, for iPadOS 15 support, it’s the same story as iOS 15. All iPads that have iPadOS 14 will get the next iteration. Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="THJ9uE"&gt;iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first through fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7awfUC"&gt;iPad Pro 11-inch (first through third generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nSheDn"&gt;iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q39aHn"&gt;iPad Pro 9.7-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LooIpb"&gt;iPad (fifth through eighth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0fRC4p"&gt;iPad Mini (fourth and fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gb9MY"&gt;iPad Air (second through fourth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2lmPaKpOvaosbL-2QI91CztGnTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643274/lcimg_e0eb6a55_c77c_4513_86a9_1373f1fd5bb0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EtLGJV"&gt;Apple’s watchOS 8 upgrade will bring the same level of device support as the ones above, leaving behind no generations that received the previous operating system update. Sensing a pattern here? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BXeSf"&gt;These watches will get the update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VZk4Tz"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3 (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;maybe Apple should reconsider this&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="68CltS"&gt;Apple Watch Series 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pFvxNq"&gt;Apple Watch Series 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h5hr38"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9XXGOa"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nwxa1fTi5UrQrIKzUHK-9COSHOw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643294/image.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XWBaz1"&gt;Now for the computers that will get the update to macOS Monterey: a few models that got the Big Sur update last year have been left out in terms of support for the new software, including the 2015 MacBook, the 2013 MacBook Air, the late 2013 MacBook Pro, and the 2014 iMac. Here’s the full list that’ll get support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="i7zV7I"&gt;iMac (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634"&gt;late 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DT8GDM"&gt;iMac Pro (2017 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TDG4DT"&gt;Mac Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202888"&gt;late 2013 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cZc8bq"&gt;Mac Mini (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201894"&gt;late 2014 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SkWfhc"&gt;MacBook Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201300"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FavKjr"&gt;MacBook Air (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201862"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SncFxN"&gt;MacBook (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201608"&gt;early 2016 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021: the 15 biggest announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tC7o0G99WQ3SsWDyA-1RDsYeGJk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418626/VRG_WWDC2021_Textless.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="viUgh4"&gt;Apple just wrapped up its WWDC 2021 keynote, and it was jam-packed with news and announcements, including our first looks at iOS 15, the new macOS Monterey, big improvements to FaceTime, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vamod1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22465927/apple-wwdc-keynote-2021-live-blog-updates-news"&gt;Our live blog&lt;/a&gt; has moment-by-moment commentary on what Apple announced from Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn. But if you just want to know the big-ticket items from the show, we’ve got you covered right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LAw8dw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22220915"&gt;iOS 15 brings big improvements to FaceTime, updates to notifications, and more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6Z4Uhb_TRKu02Wcgozb2BVlh2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643347/image__4_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h4SY4o"&gt;Apple announced iOS 15, which brings improvements to FaceTime such as spatial audio, a new “SharePlay” feature that lets you share media with people on FaceTime virtually, updates to Messages, a new look for notifications, the ability to set different “Focus” statuses, updates to Memories in Photos, a redesign to the weather app, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WL8mE6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;Apple is building video and music sharing into FaceTime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EK2koBM18PgZEbL47rR4EODomSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643074/lcimg_7f9d02c6_2dc4_44ff_83cf_a0e89d83127b.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EhoT4v"&gt;Apple’s new SharePlay feature will let you watch or listen to content with others virtually. Apple is also introducing a SharePlay API so that other developers can build apps that support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dDVF4H"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Apple is going to use AI to read all the text in your photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWjwsfwk1AQ4BA3fbd3-SuYkPPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643104/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_6.22.37_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="87XXLe"&gt;Apple’s new Live Text will digitize text in your photos, which can let you copy and paste text from a photo, for example, or call a phone number that’s in a photo. Apple says it uses “on-device intelligence” for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xQ15S8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;You’ll soon be able to use your iPhone as your ID at the airport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7-O5b2J8hNQ0zSgmY4kFCHk1q0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643126/lcimg_b1bc491d_e93b_41f1_8ac3_a0717ab1150b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="re1asU"&gt;Apple’s Wallet will soon let you store your ID in a digital form (in participating US states), which you’ll then use as identification in US airports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h72yPd"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227853"&gt;iPadOS 15 lets you drop widgets on the homescreen and brings changes to multitasking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f4Uqto7bppgfN_DbrFeRemvJTbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643163/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_10.42.38_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iHJMpC"&gt;With iPadOS 15, Apple will let you add widgets to the homescreen and access to the app library, which debuted last year on iPhone with iOS 14. Apple is also introducing improvements to multitasking, with new controls that make it easier to manage your apps, and you’ll be able to build apps with Swift Playgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ndwB3w"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"&gt;Apple adds welcome privacy features to Mail, Safari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7wJKjyJDNTetF-lJuy2-fT30Gak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643391/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_11.52.57_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="paMHeJ"&gt;Apple announced new privacy-focused features at WWDC, including that Apple Mail will block tracking pixels with Mail Privacy Protection and that Safari will hide IPs. Apple is also introducing a new section in settings called the “App Privacy Report.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bwMeDO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522993/apple-siri-on-device-speech-recognition-no-internet-wwdc"&gt;Apple’s Siri will finally work without an internet connection with on-device speech recognition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SB2FPxSp06OqR38M9bkobdYCPNE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643264/image__2_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YulMJc"&gt;Apple will let Siri process voice requests on device, meaning audio won’t be sent over the web, and Siri can accept many requests while offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qz4RgC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522872/health-app-family-mobility-fall-risk-wwdc-2021"&gt;Apple lets users see family members’ Health data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErxPHcZb2LgGdenjpn744uZhr0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643262/835_2021_06_07_835_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x4v18m"&gt;Apple is introducing a number of new health-focused features, such as the ability to share health data with your families and with healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BNfD8w"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;Apple is making AirPods easier to hear with and find&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ymGgGvxKoJIkolRxqYQydaCC6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643145/image.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3Qpr0x"&gt;Apple is making some new changes to AirPods, such as making it easier to find them on the Find My network and the ability to announce your notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2isK3h"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;Apple’s iCloud Plus bundles a VPN, private email, and HomeKit camera storage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NtDwg-U1uhs0lNvo5Myl0VgIPJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643242/lcimg_5fc31959_edd6_480f_9edb_5ad1a368da4d.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="29sSDH"&gt;Apple’s iCloud is getting a new private relay service and the ability to create burner emails called “Hide My Email.” These will be part of a new iCloud Plus subscription, which will be offered at no additional price to current iCloud paid users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cSY1yR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;Apple announces watchOS 8 with new health features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lt7uAn"&gt;Apple’s upcoming watchOS 8 has new health features, including a new Mindfulness app, improvements to the Photos watchface, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dxWAVE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523045/apple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv"&gt;Siri is coming to third-party accessories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Korxq-mASxTgfdIrUk-OWivJiY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643285/871_2021_06_07_871_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c2uDHt"&gt;Apple will let third-party accessory makers add Siri to their devices, Apple announced during WWDC. The company showed it on an Ecobee thermostat in its presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XeTmlB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey lets you use the same cursor and keyboard across Macs and iPads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LDk5w18GNB_DDMGNPfUA6Zx3Rso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643312/887_2021_06_07_887_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nvex1T"&gt;Apple’s next big macOS release is called Monterey. One big new feature is the ability to use the same mouse and keyboard across your Mac and your iPad. Apple’s Shortcuts app is also coming to the Mac. And Monterey adds improvements to FaceTime, SharePlay, and Apple’s new “Focus” statuses that are coming to Apple’s other software platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WRuHpZ"&gt;Apple redesigns Safari on the Mac with a new tab design and tab groups&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TCt5f3T7aNKNOLRZk96aCgyN-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643328/896_2021_06_07_896_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qtNz9f"&gt;Apple is redesigning Safari with a new look for tabs and tab groups. And on iOS, the tab bar will be at the bottom of the screen to be in easier reach of your thumb. Web extensions are also coming to iOS and iPadOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UrO0ID"&gt;Apple is bringing TestFlight to the Mac to help developers test their apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjkc1P"&gt;Apple announced that it will let developers use TestFlight to test their apps on the Mac. The company also announced Xcode Cloud, which lets you test your apps across all Apple devices in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple introduces Siri for third-party devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Na6kHEQOPltkp6vsxMt9OfrGW3A=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418452/lcimg_bdd5a604_baa2_4518_a03e_bf828a525d3e.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfREqO"&gt;Siri is finally coming to third-party devices. Apple announced at its WWDC keynote that HomeKit accessory makers will be able to integrate Siri voice control into their products starting later this year. The voice assistant will be routed through a HomePod if the devices are connected to your network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EfaW1"&gt;Apple hasn’t released a comprehensive list of devices and brands that will support Siri. The company demoed it on an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2Fecobee-smart-thermostat-apple-siri%2F%3Futm_source%3Dorganic_twitter%26utm_medium%3Dorganicsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartthermostat_siri_announcement&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523045%2Fapple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ecobee&lt;/a&gt; thermostat during its WWDC keynote presentation. It also announced support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; — a new interoperability standard that has big players like Amazon, Google, and Samsung on board — will come with iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugvo3D"&gt;Apple also revealed a number of smaller smart home features. Home Keys, which allow you to remotely lock and unlock doors by tapping your iPhone or Apple Watch, are coming to Wallet app, as are work keys and hotel keys. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BAAvmp"&gt;The HomePod Mini will support lossless audio in Apple Music later this year and will be able to function as a speaker for the Apple TV 4K (as does the discontinued full-size HomePod). Apple also announced that the HomePod Mini will ship to more countries this month — including Austria, Ireland, and New Zealand — as well as Italy by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dx85Oa"&gt;HomePods also now support commands for the Apple TV (so you can ask Siri to play shows), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;SharePlay&lt;/a&gt; now works with Apple TV, which will enable you to watch shows synchronously with friends over FaceTime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVHqG1"&gt;Speaking of Apple TV, tvOS now includes a “Share with You” row, where friends can share shows with each other via text messages. Another new row called “For All Of You” is intended to help families find shows to watch together — it will curate suggestions that combine every user’s viewing history. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kOqvv3"&gt;And the Apple Watch now supports the HomePod’s intercom feature, which will allow you to talk to HomeKit-enabled doorbells and access package detection from your wrist. You’ll be able to control nearby HomeKit accessories in camera view.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple lets users see family members’ Health data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5CY5t2zUbaXFVslJ_h3STUGkC0=/5x256:806x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418399/image__3_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvtRRE"&gt;Apple will let people share the data from their Health app with family members or others, the company announced. It’s one of a new slate of health features for iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPLlL9"&gt;With permission, someone can share access to their overall heart rate and movement data. They’ll also be able to share access to alerts, which will ping authorized users when the feature notices things like a high heart rate or change in mobility. The person they’re sharing the data with can message them directly about any changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMdbCC"&gt;“Many people around the world are caring for someone, and we want to provide a secure and private way for users to have a trusted partner on their health journey,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-personal-health-by-introducing-secure-sharing-and-new-insights%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22522872%2Fhealth-app-family-mobility-fall-risk-wwdc-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIwShd"&gt;The feature could be useful to caregivers who may be keeping tabs on the health of their loved ones, like elderly parents, from a distance. Older adults, though, tend to be &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article-abstract/60/5/926/5491612"&gt;less comfortable with this type of monitoring&lt;/a&gt; than their caregivers are. Monitoring tools can give peace of mind to caregivers while feeling invasive to the people tracked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EY2NwH"&gt;Apple is also adding another health metric, called walking steadiness, to the Health app. It will use mobility data already collected by the iPhone to monitor for any changes to factors like balance or walking patterns, and will tell users if they’re at an increased risk of falling. The app will also include some exercises to help increase steadiness. The company says it built the system using data collected through a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/get-involved/apple-heart-and-movement-study"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; that included over 100,000 participants of all ages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxMNvH"&gt;Falls are a major public health challenge. Each year, around 30 million adults over the age of 65 fall, and many falls lead to injuries or other health issues. Falls are responsible for $50 billion healthcare costs a year, &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180402.25780/full/"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmsLCz"&gt;Users will now also be able to share their Health app data with their doctors. Physicians already regularly have patients &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"&gt;bringing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463322/wearables-afib-apple-fitbit-doctor-visit"&gt;readouts&lt;/a&gt; from their devices into appointments. The integration will let people transfer that data more directly. Apple said the feature will start off with support from six electronic medical record companies in the United States, including Cerner and Athenahealth. Doctors using those platforms would be able to see the data in the medical record. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey lets you run Shortcuts and share files between Macs and iPads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lbbg3kwo6UfUluS7bo1ST7-BCvM=/5x0:1564x1039/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418342/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cSXpW2"&gt;Apple has announced the next version of macOS at its WWDC keynote, after showing off iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS. It’s calling it Monterey, in keeping the California location-based theme it’s had since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8Ih2W"&gt;The company is promising even more interoperability with iOS, including the ability to share a keyboard and mouse between a Mac and an iPad. The feature is similar to the one found on Logitech keyboards and mice, letting you seamlessly move your cursor and files between a Mac and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KytFw4"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Drag_And_Drop_Demo|102462" data-volume-uuid="d15336f46" data-volume-id="102462" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-988" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The jaw-dropping drag-and-drop demo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjz1Oc"&gt;Macs are also getting the ability to act as an AirPlay target, allowing you to use your Mac’s screen and speakers to play content from your iPhone and iPad, or even another Mac if you’re feeling spicy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shoSvl"&gt;Apple has also announced that Macs will be getting the Shortcuts automation application.  The familiar editor from iOS will be available, but with actions specifically for macOS. Apple will also be including pre-built Shortcuts for what it thinks will be common tasks. Users will be able to access Shortcuts from almost anywhere on the system, including in Spotlight, from the menu bar, and using Siri. People who have already been automating their Macs will be happy to hear that Shortcuts will be able to import existing Automator workflows (though Apple does make it clear that there will be a transition between the two over the coming years).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2q6e6Fy7sjYhax40SocirjAjoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643692/Apple_macos_monterey_shortcuts_gallery_06072021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy Mac automation has a new face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wCx6Qj"&gt;In addition, Safari is getting a bit of a redesign, with the tabs and address bar all moving up into the same space, and the tabs getting a new, floating look that’s somewhat reminiscent of Firefox’s recent re-design. Apple has also introduced tab groups to the browser. Of course, tab groups are synced between your Mac and iOS devices, but they’re also easy to share — Apple demoed dragging a group into a Mail window, which created a bulleted list of links for the recipient. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3CqAvW5vjfWXinHsdR749MBUdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643340/image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at the new Safari interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KUGPIh"&gt;Apple is also bringing many of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;features announced for iOS and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; to the Mac, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime’s group watching/listening abilities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;Quick Note&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbR5di"&gt;This is the first version of macOS that’s being announced after the rise of Apple’s M1-powered Macs, the first of which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21552828/apple-macbook-air-arm-m1-chip-laptop-specs-price-release-date"&gt;was announced in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s plan is to have its entire line switch over to its custom chips by the end of next year, so it seems that macOS Monterey will be the operating system shepherding Macs through much of the transition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udsbPB"&gt;To see which of the previous Macs Monterey will run on, you can see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523116/apple-ios-ipados-15-watchos-8-macos-monterey-wwdc-2021"&gt;our article breaking down the device compatibility&lt;/a&gt; of everything Apple announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eB965P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 6:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with information that AirPlay will work from Mac to Mac.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
