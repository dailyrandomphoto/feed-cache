    <title>Waze will soon support CarPlay’s split-view dashboard mode </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NaOh4tV63SAzV49sMyc9ixD94fI=/45x0:765x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845961/waze_carplay_split_view_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MxuQD5"&gt;Waze is finally coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18693555/apple-ios-13-carplay-interface-update-hands-on-test-review"&gt;Apple CarPlay’s new multiscreen dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. This is sure to come as welcome news to devotees of the Google-owned navigation app, who have been waiting for over a year for it to work with the much-improved, upgraded version of CarPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoA1EQ"&gt;A tipster who is beta testing the new feature sent us this image of Waze operating in CarPlay’s new Split View function. Apple rolled out the new dashboard as part of last year’s iOS 13 software update, but it was limited to only work with Apple Maps at the time. Previously, CarPlay required bouncing between different screens to see a track name while getting directions to a destination. With Split View, you can see a map, what’s currently playing on the car’s stereo, and the next piece of guidance to your destination all in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkicLT"&gt;Apple eventually released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194115/carplay-dashboard-third-party-map-support-ios-apple"&gt;iOS 13.4 earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, which introduced the option for third-party companies to add support for the dashboard mode on their own mapping apps. It took Google until August 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358978/google-maps-carplay-dashboard-mode-update-support-directions"&gt;implement support for Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;. And now it seems like Waze (which is also owned by Google) is soon to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sI35hT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 13’s best upgrade is in your car","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18693555/apple-ios-13-carplay-interface-update-hands-on-test-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BmWO7M"&gt;A spokesperson for Waze wouldn’t confirm the beta testing, so we’re not sure when the navigation company plans to officially announce the rollout. “We actually don’t have anything to share right now. Will be sure to keep you posted if/when we do,” the spokesperson said in an email. Waze has 140 million monthly active users who drive more than 24 billion miles (40 billion kilometers) every month. The company was founded in Israel in 2008 and was later acquired by Google in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNMc2j"&gt;The beta also features the first support for lane guidance in Waze for iOS, the tipster said. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437960/waze-lane-guidance-traffic-notifications-google-maps-features-amazon-music"&gt;This handy feature&lt;/a&gt; recommends what lane you should be in when you’re entering or exiting a freeway, for instance. It’s also helpful when navigating complicated intersections or highway mergers. The tipster described the ability to use Waze in CarPlay’s new split-screen dashboard as “really smooth” and a “game-changer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqPuXF"&gt;Like many companies, Waze has been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has emptied roadways around the world and sent many cities into lockdown. As sheltering in place and working from home become the new norm, fewer people are using Waze for their daily navigation needs. Fewer eyeballs on the app means less advertising revenue for the company, which led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428907/waze-layoff-pandemic-google-navigation-driving"&gt;Waze laying off 5 percent of its global workforce&lt;/a&gt;, or around 30 people, in September. More recently, the company’s CEO Noam Bardin announced that he would be &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/waze-ceo-noam-bardin-to-leave-company-in-early-2021/"&gt;stepping down in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple TV remote has yet another alternate option that includes buttons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_TKSU7PjnTlANaXHz0N_u-purl0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67840072/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhEt5t"&gt;Universal Electronics Inc. (UEI) has introduced its version of the notoriously unpopular Apple TV remote “specifically developed and designed” for cable, satellite, and MVPD  (multichannel video program distributor) customers, &lt;a href="https://www.uei.com/press/2020/11/20/universal-electronics-inc-to-launch-apple-tv-remote-control-for-mvpds/"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmcekl"&gt;The remote uses Bluetooth low energy or infrared to connect with the box, has a microphone to speak commands to Siri, and its universal remote function allows control of TVs and audio devices from any brand or manufacturer. It has backlit keys, which activate via an ambient light sensor, a button to flip through channels, and a mute button, according to UEI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uTFoG"&gt;“We’re excited that customers worldwide will soon be able to enjoy this new remote, designed specifically for the growing number of MVPDs offering Apple TV 4K to their subscribers,” said Paul Arling, CEO of Universal Electronics, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fatbaa2eJb0BPJrmg92AGVM69D4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22065126/uei_remote.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Universal Electronics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universal Electronics new remote is for Apple TV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dl5Ass"&gt;Universal isn’t the first company to introduce an Apple TV remote alternative; last year, Swiss TV and internet provider &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/9/21002605/apple-tv-remote-salt-swiss-tv-company-replacement-buttons-normal"&gt;Salt developed a remote&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with Apple after the touchpad controls on the native remote proved frustrating for users used to having standard buttons. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332433/apple-tv-remote-buttons-function-salt-siri-streaming-box-controller-price"&gt;Function introduced its Button Remote for Apple TV&lt;/a&gt; in July. The Salt model has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332433/apple-tv-remote-buttons-function-salt-siri-streaming-box-controller-price"&gt;difficult to buy&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrWHO3"&gt;UEI’s remote will be available beginning next year, but consumers won’t be able to buy the remote directly from Universal. The company plans to sell branded versions of the remote directly via the cable companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoQ9WM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest teardown from iFixit shows how huge the iPhone 12 Pro Max camera is</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctoKDZ2fyt0fyi4Fs4Ns0IZ7Btk=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67839634/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has an enviable camera&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is Apple’s biggest iPhone ever, with a 6.7-inch display that boasts a camera system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;our reviewer called&lt;/a&gt; “one of the most confident smartphone cameras.” In its latest teardown, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fifixit.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F21%2F21588664%2Fapple-iphone-12-pro-max-teardown-ifixit-camera#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt; shows how big this impressive camera actually is compared to other iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7CJLcRZjqLg6Fj0KNzy1UKDp2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22064774/iphone_pro_max_12_camera.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max camera is quite large&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SrEDMF"&gt;The primary wide-angle sensor “dwarfs the iPhone 12’s sensor,” iFixit says, coming in around 47 percent larger. But it has the same 12 MP resolution as the smaller model. The 12 Pro Max’s sensor-shift image stabilization system— found on most DSLR cameras— adds bulk to the large main camera, iFixit found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pu0uma"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXjDFdNVnXo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0Zdbb"&gt;The 12 Pro Max’s L-shaped battery is the largest among all current iPhone models, weighing in at 14.13Wh, compared to the 8.57Wh in the mini and the 10.78 Wh in the 12 and 12 Pro. But iFixit notes that’s actually slightly smaller than the 15.04Wh pack found in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro Max. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GprY-JuSf5E6QLdwOI52IYPtyIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22064775/iphone_12_pro_max_battery_l.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max battery (right) dwarfs the other iPhone 12 model batteries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iRSQ2j"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max —the most expensive iPhone on the market right now starting at $1,099 — “is arguably Apple’s finest iPhone-related achievement this year,” iFixit says. The device adds “demanding 5G tech with no obvious compromises to other components.” Check out &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPhone%2B12%2BPro%2BMax%2BTeardown%2F138640%3Fvgo_ee%3D3bheJeT%252FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%252BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F21%2F21588664%2Fapple-iphone-12-pro-max-teardown-ifixit-camera#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit’s full teardown&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 12 Pro Max here. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vo5w1S"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563821/vergecast-podcast-430-apple-iphone-mini-pro-max-m1-chips-macbook"&gt;Last week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the crew spent some time discussing Apple’s announcement of new Mac computers with its own Arm-based processor chip, which Apple is calling the M1. This week, &lt;em&gt;Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn got their hands on the new &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OEaKQ0pxQsg"&gt;MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with the M1 chips&lt;/a&gt; for review and brought their findings to this week’s episode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpzz3D"&gt;Nilay and Dieter also bring in deputy editor Dan Seifert and editor Chris Welch to discuss their experiences with the new computers in regards to performance, battery life, and running iOS apps on macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RsaTui"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7961322068" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6vJ1Ec"&gt;But before they got into all of that, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; starts the discussion with an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/walt-mossberg-verge"&gt;legendary tech reviewer Walt Mossberg&lt;/a&gt;, who was able to try out the new MacBook Air for himself. Walt gives his first impressions as well as some background behind what he calls “one of the most seminal products of the last 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAAt31"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a lightly edited excerpt from that conversation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="119csa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nilay Patel: We have obviously just reviewed the new MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 chip, and you have had one as well. I’m dying to know what you think of this sort of major internal change to the Mac even though the outside kind of looks the same. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrWw2g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walt Mossberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so I just want to say one thing first: I actually believe that the MacBook — which you know and I know was the thing that the Windows guys were trying to copy for years and years — doesn’t get enough credit for being one of the seminal products of the last 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Leg23"&gt;I mean, it’s not as seminal as the iPhone or the first Android phone or whatever. But it was a seminal product because light, thin laptops tended to be cramped before the MacBook Air, and there were a lot of compromises. And the MacBook Air also kind of almost tied — I think it maybe was a month before one of the ThinkPads — in having an SSD. There were a bunch of things about it that were notable. And then the 2010 one was a huge improvement, and then the 2013 one, ironically, given what’s happening now because of an Intel chip — the Haswell chip at the time — which was specifically meant to give a huge leap in battery life. &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130618/power-testing-can-two-new-laptops-really-last-all-day/"&gt;I got in my test. I looked it up&lt;/a&gt;. I got 12 hours on it, and they were only claiming 10 different battery tests, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f0yAo"&gt;So I think the MacBook Air is a really important consumer tech product. And I think this one is — I mean, I agree with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Dieter’s review&lt;/a&gt; — I think it’s sort of amazing. I mean, we’ve all known they were going to do this. I’m no chip expert, processor expert, but from what I can understand, they’ve pulled off something amazing in a relatively short time. And by that, I mean it takes a long time to develop a processor. It’s not like doing some other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CVBFn"&gt;So in my use of this, I think the single thing that has impressed me most, the battery life has impressed me. I’ve not plugged this in in about 36 hours, and I have 75 percent battery life. So that’s fantastic. It’s buttery smooth. It’s fast as can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsqQZi"&gt;But the thing that really impresses me is their translation layer. This thing called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304182/apple-arm-mac-rosetta-2-emulation-app-converter-explainer"&gt;Rosetta 2&lt;/a&gt;. They had a Rosetta when they made another processor change some years ago. And what it does is it takes apps that have not been written for this processor that were written for the Intel — which is most of the third-party apps so far — and it runs them. And I got to tell you, they run fast. They run normally. I mean, fast. If you were doing a blind test and you didn’t know this was originally written for Intel, still written for Intel, and it was running through this Rosetta thing, you would never know it. At least that’s been my experience. I don’t know if it’s been yours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XplDlN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter Bohn: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, no, completely. To me, that’s one of the most impressive parts. Maybe if you were staring at how many times it bounced in the dock when it launched for the first time after reboot or something, you might be able to tell the difference. But otherwise, just exactly the same. And it’s my understanding that they co-developed this processor hardware with Rosetta 2 in mind and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdORax"&gt;So I think part of what’s happening here is this whole thing where Apple says we are able to integrate hardware and software that makes our stuff really special — sometimes that seems like a true claim, and sometimes it seems like it’s more marketing than reality. I think in this particular case with Rosetta 2, it’s absolutely reality that I don’t think their translation software would have worked as well if the chip team didn’t know it was coming and they didn’t know what was on the chip. My hunch is there’s some sort of thing inside the M1 chip that is just there just to make Rosetta fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1246841126"&gt;Last week I wrote that Apple seemed “astonishingly confident” in its new M1-based Macs. This week we know why: they are astonishingly good. I reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, Nilay Patel reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and Chris Welch reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;new Mac mini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7PZie"&gt;All three are equally impressive, but it’s the Air in particular that stands out as offering incredible power at its price point. I’m also impressed with battery life. And the fact that Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer doesn’t cause slowdown or bugs for legacy apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUnrCn"&gt;Wins all around, then. Not very often that happens in consumer tech! The webcams are still terrible and there are lots of questions about what will happen with the &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; pro Macs we will start seeing in the next couple of years. But rather than constantly look ahead to the next thing, just for a moment, enjoy: a tech company made a big promise that it could do a hard thing and then did that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ei2Ae0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9028921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="06pKVn"&gt;Okay, moment’s over. Sorry. I want to pay a little more attention to one point Chaim Gartenberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;made when writing about the importance of these computers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="V9Ujaf"&gt;The most exciting — or frightening, if you’re a traditional PC chip company — part of Apple’s new chips is that the M1 is just the starting point. It’s Apple’s first-generation processor, designed to replace the chips in Apple’s weakest, cheapest laptops and desktops. Imagine what Apple’s laptops might do if the company can replicate that success on its high-end laptops and desktops or after a few more years of maturation for the M-series lineup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf2CVF"&gt;It’s not difficult to divine the future of Intel and even Qualcomm’s roadmap — they are consistent (and consistently dull) in their year-over-year improvements. Their customers are phone and laptop makers, so they need to be clear and transparent about what’s up. And I don’t see either pulling a step change like the M1 out of a hat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVIeH0"&gt;By contrast, we really have no idea what Apple’s chip roadmap looks like. We can make educated guesses based on what we would expect from the current chip and Apple’s philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPX9uE"&gt;We do know, however, that Apple is remarkably stable in its Mac product lineup. It doesn’t introduce a ton of different models. Different people could count differently, but I think there are eight distinct Macs that Apple sells: the Air, the entry level 13-inch MacBook Pro, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the Mac mini, the iMac (two sizes on this one), the iMac Pro, and the Mac Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWnU0t"&gt;I’m listing them all out to make a point: if you’re familiar with Macs, you have a sort of inherent idea of what those computers are, relative to each other. That’s the other way we can perhaps predict what’s next for Apple silicon. For example, we know how much more powerful an iMac is than an Air, on a rough basis. But now with the Air, the baseline for that rough basis has just been radically improved. So if the Apple silicon-based iMac continues to be as big a leap over the M1-based MacBook Air as it has been in the past, look out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iV3RL"&gt;But even if that doesn’t happen, PC makers have a problem &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;. So let’s come back to right now. Apple has a thousand-dollar laptop that beats the pants off anything else in its price class, and so every Windows ultrabook is going to be compared to it for the foreseeable future — and may likely be found wanting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdkuaT"&gt;We have a running joke at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that our old colleague Joanna Stern (now at the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;) would end every Windows laptop review with “for a hundred dollars more, you could get a MacBook Air.” For the next year or two, we all might be ending reviews of thin and light Windows laptops with something like “for the same price, you can get a MacBook Air that’s faster, lasts longer on a battery, and doesn’t have a fan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHpGGV"&gt;Do Intel, Qualcomm, AMD, Microsoft, Dell, HP, Asus, Razer, or anybody else in the PC ecosystem have something that will start chopping clauses from that sentence? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="95iQtT"&gt;
&lt;p id="yHwK0C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A brief programming note — I’m taking the next week off and may allow myself to be a a little intermittent in sending newsletters in December. I appreciate you all reading and hope you are staying safe this Thanksgiving holiday — and always. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6N59YR"&gt;Apple news that isn’t so good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1246793702"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple will pay $113 million for throttling older iPhones in new ‘batterygate’ settlement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Sean Hollister:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="o5HqYe"&gt;The settlement (PDF) hasn’t been fully approved by a judge yet, but there’s a chance states might see their money sooner than actual iPhone owners. If you applied for your $25 worth of the $500 million class-action settlement, you probably did so in July, but the process is still underway. There’s a fairness hearing on December 4th that’ll decide whether the settlement was handled properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cjUsum"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple will reduce App Store cut to 15 percent for most developers starting January 1st&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; So this is a win for smaller developers, but I do think that a million dollars is kind of a low cap for a small business (costs add up fast!). One thing to note, though, is that this probably isn’t costing Apple much — the vast majority of its App Store revenue comes from bigger fish. Bottom line, though, is that it seems Apple is finally reacting to public pressure and the threat of regulation. Nick Statt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gb1MC9"&gt;The new App Store Small Business Program, as it’s called, will allow any developer who earns less than $1 million in annual sales per year from all of their apps to qualify for a reduced App Store cut of 15 percent, half of Apple’s standard 30 percent fee, on all paid app revenue and in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Ys40iX"&gt;Gaming news&lt;/h2&gt;

On the one hand, I like the idea of more people realizing that the web is a viable app platform. On the other, I hate hate hate that it’s happening because of Apple’s ridiculous App Store policies. One thing Nick Statt notes: this technically means &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is back on iOS, via this particular workaround.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHdIZT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Stadia is coming to iOS officially as a web app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Quite a day for web apps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ww126U"&gt;Google says it has been building a progressive web app version of Stadia that will run in the mobile version of Apple’s Safari browser, similar to how Microsoft intends to deliver its competing xCloud service on iOS sometime next year. But Google intends to beat Microsoft to the punch with public testing of its version in the coming weeks. Nvidia also announced today that it a beta web app version of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service on iOS is available today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1246838996"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMD Radeon RX 6800 review: entry-level 4K&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Sean Hollister makes a good case for the entry-level GPUs being better than you might expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rBjScY"&gt;But the key going forward will be moving beyond the “it’s good enough” strategy that has gotten Stadia to where it is now. That means convincing a prospective buyer of a game like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; to buy it on Stadia and not one of the half-dozen other platforms it’s available on. That scenario represents Google’s biggest and most pivotal challenge going forward. It’s made only harder by the launch of next-gen consoles from Microsoft and Sony, with the Xbox Series X / S and PlayStation 5 offering many of the same (and in some cases, better) load times and performance benefits Stadia touted last year without any of the compromises of using a streaming platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And the methods by which Google collects the information it needs to enable all those features are all private and secure — but it’s very difficult to worry that they someday won’t be either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mpKYZ3"&gt;Google has announced that it’s finally beginning to enable a key privacy feature: end-to-end encryption. For Android users who use Android Messages, one-on-one chats will eventually be end-to-end encrypted by default, meaning neither carriers nor Google will be able to read the content of those messages. Even though encryption is only beginning to roll out to people who sign up for the public beta for Android Messages, turning on encryption for RCS is a very big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have to say I didn’t expect I’d miss big fun popcorn blockbusters movies as much as I do. Excited for them to come back and even more excited to make my own damn popcorn, at home. Julia Alexander:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LSNnHW"&gt;Unlike Mulan, &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; won’t cost anything extra beyond the monthly subscription fee. HBO Max subscribers will have the opportunity to watch the film directly from home. The streaming service costs $14.99 a month. The move comes as uncertainty grows over whether theaters will remain open as cases surge across the United States. Even if they do remain open, however, it’s uncertain whether people will actually attend screenings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>iFixit teardown shows just how similar the new M1 MacBooks are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/841b5LQdsBO7RPsmnwijpupBWr8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67821990/FxeSiyYSpBwt6keG.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7u4RN6"&gt;iFixit has gotten its hands on Apple’s new M1-powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which of course is to say that its team has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F46884%2Fm1-macbook-teardowns-something-old-something-new&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F20%2F21579016%2Fapple-m1-macbook-air-pro-ifixit-teardown#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;torn the laptops apart to find out what’s inside&lt;/a&gt;. And, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Air&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Pro&lt;/a&gt; have set groundbreaking new standards for performance and efficiency, it turns out that this can be attributed almost entirely to the M1 chip rather than any particular design changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0ksH4"&gt;Take the new MacBook Pro, for instance. Here’s this year’s Intel-based model on the left, with the new M1 version on the right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XkXf4R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9590898"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KnynVu"&gt;The internal layouts of the two computers are almost identical. iFixit notes that the M1 model uses exactly the same fan component as its Intel predecessor, for example, which really does drive home the M1 chip’s efficiency considering the difference in noise levels between the two computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6YXw0"&gt;The MacBook Air, meanwhile, also looks very similar to the Intel version, but with the omission of the fan altogether. iFixit expressed a little surprise that the design of the Air and Pro didn’t converge more, considering the computers now use identical processors, but Apple’s design focus here was clearly on using the M1 as a drop-in replacement for its existing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHNZ6b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F46884%2Fm1-macbook-teardowns-something-old-something-new&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F20%2F21579016%2Fapple-m1-macbook-air-pro-ifixit-teardown#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Check out the full teardown at iFixit for more&lt;/a&gt;, including a closer look at the M1 processor itself, a complete list of other chips the team found inside, and thoughts on the laptops’ repairability. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 14.2.1 with fix for iPhone 12 mini lock screen issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgxnq-GOPlVFADy5jjCJUHnufJQ=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67818580/vpavic_4279_20201107_0043.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lYPWYc"&gt;Apple has released iOS 14.2.1 with a number of fixes, including for one that the company says will address problems with the lock screen becoming unresponsive on the iPhone 12 mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLiVuu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt; was officially released on Friday, but users reported sensitivity issues with the lock screen &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/14/iphone-12-mini-lock-screen-touch-issues/"&gt;shortly after&lt;/a&gt;. Some users had problems swiping up from the bottom of the lock screen when trying to unlock their phone as well as issues pressing the flashlight or camera buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hg8W5m"&gt;It’s unclear exactly what caused the lock screen problems, and I haven’t run into any on my iPhone 12 mini that I got on Friday. Apparently, Apple found something it could fix, though, and hopefully this update resolves the issue for those who were having problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAx7bu"&gt;Apple says that iOS 14.2.1 will also fix issues with some MMS messages not being received and addressing sound quality issues with some Made for iPhone hearing devices. If you want to download and install the update right now, you should be able to access it from the Software Update menu in the Settings app. (I’ve already fully installed the update on my device.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4iJ1w4"&gt;Google has detailed a handful of new iOS widgets it has on the way, following the launch of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574112/google-new-gmail-widget-ios-14-limitations"&gt;new Gmail widget this week&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/iphones-just-got-more-helpful-gmail-drive-and-fit-widgets/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OfficialGmailBlog+%28Gmail+%7C+Google+Blog%29"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it’s adding widgets for Drive and Google Fit, which appear to be available now, and that it has a Calendar widget planned to launch “in the coming weeks.” A widget for Chrome is due to officially launch next year and is available in beta now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaeEBI"&gt;The widgets vary from providing simple shortcuts to their app’s most commonly used features to showing important information at a glance. The Chrome widget offers quick links to web and voice searches, QR code scanning, and a shortcut to open new incognito mode tabs, while the Drive widget similarly offers shortcuts to your files and a search box. The Google Fit widget shows a running total of steps and heart points, while the Calendar widget shows upcoming appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EZ0lI-Y6WNxwSFTTvA1vFOunIg0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22052923/Google_Drive_Ua4OGKb.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nwC-1tNE1Cx7uiTUv5EYnYI7g5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22052925/Google_Chrome.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome’s widget provides a quick link to search.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0nCwK8"&gt;Google has already rolled out widgets for many of its apps, including &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/10/22/google-photos-ios-widgets/"&gt;Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/10/22/youtube-music-picks-up-ios-14-home-screen-widgets/"&gt;YouTube Music&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/easier-access-search-chrome-and-gmail-ios-14/"&gt;official search app&lt;/a&gt;. However, in some cases, it’s already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574112/google-new-gmail-widget-ios-14-limitations"&gt;running up against the limits&lt;/a&gt; of what developers are allowed to do with the iOS 14 feature. You can’t sort through an inbox using the Gmail widget, for example, or &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/10/22/youtube-music-picks-up-ios-14-home-screen-widgets/"&gt;control playback of music&lt;/a&gt; with the YouTube Music widget. Hopefully this functionality is possible in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia is coming to iOS officially as a web app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuaYe7wZW2ORF0ULGyeFt0RXTbI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67817574/akrales_191113_3779_0319.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZY8pmW"&gt;Google on Thursday announced iOS support for its Stadia cloud gaming service, following in the footsteps of Microsoft in turning to the mobile web to circumvent Apple’s App Store restrictions. Google says it has been building a progressive web app version of Stadia that will run in the mobile version of Apple’s Safari browser, similar to how Microsoft intends to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508706/microsoft-xcloud-ios-web-browser-2021"&gt;deliver its competing xCloud service on iOS&lt;/a&gt; sometime next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHLBll"&gt;But Google intends to beat Microsoft to the punch with public testing of its version in the coming weeks. Nvidia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;also announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it a beta web app version of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service on iOS is available today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qucZ0h"&gt;Apple in late August &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;clarified its rules around cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;, telling providers like Google and Microsoft that their apps were not allowed on the App Store due to restrictions Apple imposes on software that streams games to the iPhone and iPad. Apple eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;loosened its restrictions&lt;/a&gt; after public criticism from Microsoft and others, but the App Store still requires companies to submit individual games for App Store review. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;called the compromise a “bad experience for consumers”&lt;/a&gt; before deciding it would develop a web app version of xCloud for iOS instead. Now, Google is doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mw2qzi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s web app version of its cloud gaming service will arrive before Microsoft’s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Ep28U"&gt;The iOS testing announcement coincides with Stadia’s one-year anniversary of its public launch last fall. Google also announced today that its first slate of free-to-play games would be coming to Stadia, following the reveal earlier this week that the base version of Bungie’s &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; would no longer require a $10 per month Stadia Pro subscription and can now be played by anyone with a Google account that signs up for Stadia. And State Share, the streamer-friendly Stadia feature that allows players to share their exact point in a game with viewers or followers on social media, will be launching next January with the release of IO Interactive’s &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmiicV"&gt;Google is also using its one-year anniversary as an opportunity to tout fresh Stadia statistics. The company won’t yet reveal how many people have signed up for Stadia or subscribed to its Pro service. But the company says it’s introduced more than 80 games in the last 12 months to the platform, with plans to support more than 135 titles by the end of the year. It’s also added more than 100 new features to the platform in the last 12 months, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21546194/google-stadia-family-sharing-digital-games-purchase-share"&gt;family sharing for the first time earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALpQZV"&gt;That library also includes more than 50 Stadia Pro games that have been made available for free since the service’s launch, with more than 30 active titles available as of this month. (Some games are added to Stadia Pro for a limited time before they are removed, similar to limited giveaways of games as part of Sony’s PlayStation Plus and Microsoft’s Xbox Live Gold subscriptions.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fQFAB"&gt;To celebrate the upcoming launch of CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, Google is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;running a rather excellent promotion&lt;/a&gt;: preordering the game before December 10th or buying the released version before December 17th will get you a Stadia Premiere Edition bundle, which includes the Stadia controller and a Chromecast Ultra for streaming Stadia to a television. The promotion is just while supplies last, though, and Google isn’t saying how many units it will be giving out. So it’s perhaps a good idea to preorder early if you’re interested in making Stadia the platform you use to play &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s first-gen M1 chips have already upended our concept of laptop performance </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZ0ygRu8StspgQ58fyXINCHZ6AM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67817283/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pQ5zZb"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;first M1 MacBooks are here&lt;/a&gt;, and the world of laptops has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;changed overnight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6737Y3"&gt;When Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be transitioning its computers — specifically, the MacBook Air and entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, its most popular PCs — to a new and wildly different type of processor, there were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556481/apple-new-arm-mac-expectations-preview-one-more-thing-event"&gt;plenty of reasons to be skeptical&lt;/a&gt;. Apple was making huge claims for battery life and performance, things that the first wave of Arm-based laptops from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20948092/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Qualcomm and Microsoft failed to deliver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcyDKt"&gt;But deliver Apple did, with computers powered by a new M1 processor that aren’t just close to their previous Intel counterparts, but crush them in nearly every respect — and not just the base model Intel chips that the M1 purports to replace, either. In both early benchmarks and head-to-head comparisons &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328705433675161601"&gt;for compiling code&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s M1 chip appears to hold its own against even &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/17/m1-benchmarks-proves-apple-silicon-outclasses-nearly-all-current-intel-mac-chips"&gt;Intel’s most powerful Core i9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://laptopmedia.com/comparisons/preliminary-apple-m1-vs-intel-core-i9-10980hk-the-m1-is-better-in-single-core-but-loses-in-multi-core/"&gt;chip for laptops&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0cIzmi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Keep in mind this comparison is deeply unfair: my 16-inch MacBook Pro was literally maxed out just a year ago – 8 cores, 64GB RAM, and much more, costing $6000.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In comparison the M1 costs just $2000 and manages to hammer the Intel machine with a quarter of the RAM.&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Hudson (@twostraws) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328705433675161601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NsRU0m"&gt;The conversation has flipped instantly: it’s no longer “why would you take a gamble on Apple’s new, unproven processor” but “how will competitors like Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm respond?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92yuVF"&gt;For years, Intel and AMD have been playing a chess match, sniping back and forth with improvements in CPU performance, battery life, and onboard graphics. Apple appears to be playing an entirely different game on an entirely different level. The same interplay between hardware and software that has led to such huge successes on the iPhone and iPad has now come to the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lHXvZZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s software is designed to make the most of that hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XRXYz3"&gt;It’s not just that Apple’s hardware is faster (although straight benchmarks would indicate that it is); it’s that Apple’s software is designed to make the most of that hardware, in a way that even the best optimization of macOS on an x86 system wasn’t. &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs"&gt;As John Gruber notes&lt;/a&gt; (citing Apple engineer David Smith) the new chips handle fundamental low-level macOS app tasks up to five times faster on the M1 than they do on Intel because Apple was able to design a chip from the ground up to specifically be good at those tasks. It’s why the new M1 Macs (and the existing iPhone and iPad lineups) are able to do more with comparatively less RAM than their Intel (and Android) counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMDmqx"&gt;Apple has also done incredible work with Rosetta 2, its translation layer for running legacy x86 applications on the M1. It’s another key part of how Apple’s software strategy pays off big dividends for the new hardware by making it seamless to run older software on the new Mac without any real hits to performance. Apple almost certainly has factored Rosetta 2 optimization into the M1’s design, benefiting from the same parallel development as the rest of the hardware. The result is that M1 laptops don’t make users choose between great performance on Arm-optimized apps at the expense of legacy x86 performance; instead, they run old apps well and new optimized apps even better. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9mt90mnlKHMut6r7vD9pS0eSNmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22046475/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V9Ujaf"&gt;The most exciting — or frightening, if you’re a traditional PC chip company — part of Apple’s new chips is that the M1 is just the starting point. It’s Apple’s first-generation processor, designed to replace the chips in Apple’s weakest, cheapest laptops and desktops. Imagine what Apple’s laptops might do if the company can replicate that success on its high-end laptops and desktops or after a few more years of maturation for the M-series lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq4aUH"&gt;Right now, the saving grace for traditional x86 laptops is that it’s only Apple, with its near-complete control over its hardware and software stack, that’s managed to accomplish this level of speed, software performance, and battery life on Arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Cl66f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Where do competitors even go from here?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5yWiFd"&gt;It’s an open question whether companies like Qualcomm and Microsoft will be able to emulate Apple’s success with the next wave of Arm-based Windows machines. Certainly, it would take a much bigger restructuring of Windows, one that would impact a far greater number of customers than Apple’s changes. And while Microsoft does design its own Surface laptops — and even worked with Qualcomm on building Arm-based SQ1 and SQ2 chips for its Surface Pro X lineup — it’s still a far cry from the level of control that Apple maintains over its software / hardware ecosystem that allows so much of the M1’s success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Szez5"&gt;The new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro won’t be the perfect laptops for everyone, especially if you rely on huge, GPU-intensive tasks or specific developer tools. But when a $1,000 M1 laptop can &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328705433675161601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1328705433675161601%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;outdo&lt;/a&gt; a maxed-out, $6,000 MacBook Pro with quadruple the RAM and Intel’s best chip, while &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; running cooler and quieter in a smaller and lighter form factor and with twice the battery life, where do competitors even go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQcg0T"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2EvNu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
