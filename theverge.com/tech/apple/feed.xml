    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjCL3h"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15.2, which includes a ton of features and fixes, has started to become roll out to iPhones after an extensive beta period. According to Apple’s release notes, posted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2-watchos-8-3-and-tvos-15-2-to-all-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the update includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="txvrW9"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;The Digital Legacy program&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22812264/digital-legacy-death-estate-google-apple-how-to"&gt;designate who gets access to your data&lt;/a&gt; when you die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1i2stA"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;The App Privacy Report&lt;/a&gt;, which shows what permissions your apps use, and what websites they connect to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TqxDX0"&gt;Apple’s $4.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822631/apple-music-voice-plan-ios-15-2-release-candidate"&gt;voice-only plan for Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Jr09g"&gt;A fix for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;somewhat confusing state of the 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2XMGjZ"&gt;The update also brings with it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;some of Apple’s communication safety features&lt;/a&gt;, one of which will blur iMessages sent to children that an on-device scan tags as potentially being explicit. The feature was part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;Apple’s controversial suite of changes&lt;/a&gt; meant to fight child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which involved on-device scanning of photos uploaded to iCloud, as well as automatically notifying parents if their child chose to view pictures tagged as inappropriate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ItxICe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kb2zI4"&gt;Apple has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delayed the photo library scanning feature&lt;/a&gt; and has made it so that children get to choose whether to notify their parents. iOS 15.2 also brings changes to Safari and Siri that will redirect users to resources if they search for topics related to CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCRjka"&gt;To download iOS 15.2, go to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update. As usual, it can take a moment to roll out to everyone, so if you don’t see it you may want to check back in after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Apple employee says she won’t withdraw her labor board complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DN-viq88iRgLXKnBD9TUqV9LjhM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251636/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhlsXd"&gt;Former Apple employee Cher Scarlett says the company didn’t adequately live up to its half of a settlement, so she won’t withdraw her complaint to the National Labor Relations Board as agreed, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__8jy2n3rr1sb"&gt;Scarlett says that her settlement with Apple required it to post “a company-wide memo clarifying employee rights including discussing pay &amp;amp; working conditions,” “in a prominent and visible location on the People site.” She says that the company did post a notice to its site, but that it was only up during the week that Apple employees were given off for Thanksgiving. “I’d argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible,” Scarlett &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032"&gt;tweeted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyTsr3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Despite the fact that there was no requirement for a time period, the agreement clearly stated "in a prominent and visible location on the People site".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible.&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f6ksV6"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/facilitate-settlements"&gt;NLRB says&lt;/a&gt; it can reject a withdrawal request made because of a private settlement if it “violates the National Labor Relations Act or Board policy.” Scarlett told&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the board initially rejected her request, and sent a list of 22 changes that the board would need Apple to make before it would approve the withdrawal. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the requested changes removed wording that would’ve prevented Scarlett from encouraging someone “to file any charge or complaint with any administrative agency or Court against Apple” for a year. According to Scarlett, Apple refused to make those changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7x6pQ"&gt;“I technically could ask for a unilateral withdrawal at this point,” Scarlett said in a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying that she had been “interested in doing that to avoid witnesses having to give testimony, because realistically the memo is the best outcome we would have gotten from the board.” According to Scarlett, the group of potential witnesses decided it was worth it to continue with the complaint, potentially risking retaliation for testifying, given how Apple handled posting the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2pYYC"&gt;Scarlett &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22788245/cher-scarlett-apple-nlrb-settlement-leaves-company-appletoo-pay-equity"&gt;left the company in November&lt;/a&gt;, after filing the complaint that accused the company of engaging “in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity.” While at the company, she worked to let employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;discuss and gather data about pay equity&lt;/a&gt; and was part of #AppleToo, a campaign about the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;failure to deal with harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5gV9n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 11th, 3:47PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional context about the process of requesting that a complaint be withdrawn, and Scarlett’s decision not to do so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s app tracking transparency feature isn’t an instant privacy button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BRtHG6ikFWC0DwMOxhTVOAhRjuI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70259172/FB_ATT_Prompt.001.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByQJj0"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69396795-f6e1-4624-95d8-121e4e5d7839"&gt;report from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; acts as a reminder of what Apple’s App Tracking Transparency settings do and do not do to protect your privacy (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/apple-reaches-quiet-truce-over-iphone-privacy-changes/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While asking apps to not track you does keep them from collecting and selling data tied to your personal advertising identity, it doesn’t keep developers from collecting any information about you at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAawK0"&gt;The feature, introduced in iOS 14.5, is meant to prevent app-makers from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;tracking what you do and selling that information to advertisers&lt;/a&gt;. Companies like Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;cried foul when it was introduced&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it would hurt their ability to show targeted, personalized ads, and therefore hurt businesses that relied on those ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k1GJHu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9G2ObX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies have turned to aggregated and anonymized data, which still comes from individuals&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WDIM97"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, though, developers have taken Apple’s rules to mean that they’re allowed to target ads at cohorts, or groups that people are put into without needing to have unique IDs assigned. The report says that developers like Snap, Inc. have continued collecting some data, including from those who have asked them not to track them, with the justification that anything that could be tied to an individual user would be anonymized and grouped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfnW4L"&gt;It’s a similar concept to FLoC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;Google’s plan for a post-third-party cookie internet&lt;/a&gt;, where individuals are assigned labels describing what kind of things they might buy instead of being tracked individually. Ads can still be targeted, without advertisers having to keep track of everything everyone does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RCvaE"&gt;Some developers &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/10/more-details-emerge-on-how-snap-facebook-and-others-are-skirting-app-tracking-transparency/"&gt;have admitted&lt;/a&gt;, though, that they also try to make predictions about what users do after seeing ads based on info they receive from ad companies. The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;also says that some personalized data, like IP address, location, and screen size, still makes its way to advertisers, to help ensure that ads fit properly and show up in the right language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFJlqH"&gt;According to the report, Facebook and many other companies are planning on selling ads using aggregated or anonymized data. While Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;partially blamed Apple’s policies&lt;/a&gt; for it missing its earnings goals last quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;it’s estimated&lt;/a&gt; that the ads affected by the rules only made up 5 percent of its annual ad revenue. In other words, Apple’s ad tracking permissions were never going to destroy Facebook’s ad business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77cmgb"&gt;None of this is to say that there are no privacy benefits to hitting the “Ask app not to track” button — a previous &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation found that Snap, Inc, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/31/22756135/apple-app-tracking-transparency-policy-snapchat-facebook-twitter-youtube-lose-10-billion"&gt;lost $10 billion combined after the feature was implemented&lt;/a&gt;, so there was obviously a market for ads driven by that data. But it’s good to remember that even Apple, a company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;prides itself on “standing up” for its users&lt;/a&gt;, can’t stop companies from collecting your data with a single switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="z2xR9j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to&amp;amp;nbsp;use the iOS app tracking blocker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"},{"title":"Keep it Locked","url":"https://www.theverge.com/c/22796344/cybersecurity-how-to-protect-hacked-account"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Invasion feels like the first chapter of a sci-fi epic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBT6IX4NQ20qtGe-IsN-TpUjf4I=/482x0:3359x1918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258618/Invasion_Photo_011006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9n9RgM"&gt;The first season of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; on Apple TV Plus feels a little incomplete. Across its 10 episodes, which chart a handful of humans grappling with an alien invasion, the story slowly teases out the reality of what’s happening. There are hints here and there — a haunting artificial voice, a mysterious alien-killing weapon, a kid with seizures that may or may not show the future — but the biggest reveal of all doesn’t even happen until the very last shot in the final episode. It still managed to pull me in — but that pull has a lot to do with potential. Rather than standing on its own, the initial season of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; feels like the first chapter of a much grander science fiction epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83ezo3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; gets off to a slow start&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most stories about an alien invasion, which tend to focus on the alien part, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; lingers on human trauma. Early on, there’s barely even a mention of the invading extraterrestrials. Instead,&lt;em&gt; Invasion&lt;/em&gt;’s global story tracks a handful of different threads spread across the world, which ultimately end up loosely connected. Each has some tie to the otherworldly events: there’s a young boy in London who is prone to seizures that may be connected to the invasion; a family from Long Island that’s struggling with infidelity and also happens to possibly have a weapon that can kill the aliens; a space engineer in Japan who seems to be the only one able to communicate with them; and an American soldier who is separated from his squad in Afghanistan after what appears to be an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDs0Zv"&gt;The show does a great job of making you care about these characters, mostly because you spend so much time with them. You understand why the engineer is working tirelessly to find a stranded astronaut after lots of long, heartfelt scenes revealing their secret relationship. Likewise, while the soldier comes across as a jerk initially, his slowly revealed backstory ultimately turns him into a sympathetic figure. There’s lots of great character development going on, but it also requires patience since it takes quite a while to get to the actual aliens. For the first half of the season, it’s mostly just hints that there’s something going on beyond a natural disaster of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTc2-wBP-YFwG77benxDHPBkg08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079599/Invasion_Photo_011001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pzxnjQ"&gt;This all means that when the aliens do finally appear, it’s a huge deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776188/invasion-apple-tv-plus-episode-6-aliens"&gt;The reveal is great&lt;/a&gt; and neatly changes the tone of the show. From then on, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; becomes something different, balancing out its character drama (which never fully goes away, thankfully) with some intriguing alien mysteries and the flat-out horror of dealing with the invaders. There’s a terrifying scene in a secluded house, where a family tries to sneak away from one of the spiked blob creatures; later, we see the soldier making his way through a war-torn hospital amidst an infestation as if this was a first-person &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vgcp5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You never get much in the way of answers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AXaQXi"&gt;What you don’t get are much in the way of answers. There are some small revelations, like when you learn that the London teen had visions of the invasion before it happened or when it appears that the Japanese researcher discovers how the aliens communicate. But nothing is ever clear. Even when it seems like the aliens have been defeated, the show throws another twist at you. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Mystery is important, and those unknowns are part of what has kept me coming back. But the result is that season 1 doesn’t feel like a complete story, with its own distinct arc. It’s 10 episodes of setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ9WrR"&gt;The good news is that Apple revealed earlier this week that &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is coming back for a second season, with co-creator Simon Kinberg saying they would be “expanding our universe in the most intimate and epic ways.” And after a full season of setting things up, I’m anxious to see where it’s finally going.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="uuy4e9"&gt;Tim Cook has pushed Apple’s value within close range of $3 trillion, and a lot of that has to do with the former operations lead’s ability to manage a relationship with China, where many of its products are made and, increasingly, many of them are sold. A report this week from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; relies on unnamed sources and internal documents to peel back some of the details about Apple’s ties with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tTir7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 1,250-word MOU between Apple and China’s National Development and Reform Commission reportedly runs for five years and accounted for $275 billion in spending&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1kBY4"&gt;That includes a request Apple reportedly received in 2014 or 2015 about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senkaku_Islands"&gt;a small group of uninhabited islands&lt;/a&gt; that China and Japan apparently have a dispute over in terms of who owns them. Going by either the Senkaku Islands or the Diaoyu Islands, depending on which side of the argument you’re taking, they inspired a request from China to members of the Maps team to make them appear larger, even when viewers are zoomed out on the map. According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, not only did Apple eventually make the change, but even today, for viewers using its map from within China, the islands are still shown at a larger scale than the territories around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Satellite views of the Senkaku Islands" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYck_ik3Kilhuzno12VIIj354wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080195/588404986.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A satellite image of the Senkaku Islands located in the East of China on April 01, 2016 in Japan. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cVgQYI"&gt;The report also details disputes over everything from iTunes and iCloud to Apple Pay. The figure that looms over everything is a 1,250-word memorandum of understanding that &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says Tim Cook signed during a publicized trip to China in 2016. The way it’s laid out, Cook went to China because of repeated regulatory actions affecting Apple’s business. By signing a five-year agreement (with an option to extend to a sixth year) promising investments, business deals, and training in China, worth an estimated $275 billion, the aim was to avoid further disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj5SPP"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; has confirmed from its sources, that seems to have mostly held true. The report points out &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-becomes-largest-smartphone-brand-china-october-2021/"&gt;data from the analysts at Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; who said that in October, Apple became the largest smartphone brand in China, a title it hadn’t held in six years. Meanwhile, Apple has built new R&amp;amp;D centers in the country and started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;storing iCloud data for Chinese users there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWxick"&gt;However, that relationship also has downsides, with critics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18020508/how-china-complicates-apples-chest-thumping-about-privacy"&gt;questioning the company’s commitment to privacy&lt;/a&gt; — its Private Relay feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523871/china-private-relay-regulatory-reasons-not-launching-great-firewall-internet-censorship"&gt;will not be available in China&lt;/a&gt; — and business dealings with companies accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;links to Uyghur forced labor&lt;/a&gt;. That’s before we mention the other visible concessions that harken back to that decision about the disputed islands, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632029/apple-engraving-filter-censorship-keyword-china-hong-kong-taiwan"&gt;the numbers Apple won’t let you engrave on an iPad in China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728257/apple-quran-majeed-app-removed-china"&gt;takedowns of certain apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFqi7c"&gt;After the report surfaced, the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3159087/apples-reported-us275-billion-china-investment-questioned-state-media"&gt;&lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports (via &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/12/09/chinese-media-downplaying-apples-reported-275b-deal-with-the-country"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that a state-run tabloid in China referred to it as “McCarthyism,” claiming it was an attack “clearly driven by the ‘political correctness’ of Sinophobia.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony was bringing PlayStation Now to mobile phones, according to a confidential Apple presentation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PS2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CpfySOJughyosDwe9Z5uaGatSjQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70257065/vpavic_191126_untitled_0011_2_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cB1Lly"&gt;In 2017 — long before Apple declared that cloud gaming could only exist on the iPhone if it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;jumped through gigantic hoops&lt;/a&gt; — Sony was preparing to launch its PlayStation Now cloud gaming service on mobile phones, a confidential document reveals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocH39i"&gt;It could have been the single biggest expansion of Sony’s PS Now game service in years. Originally, the service streamed PS2 and PS3 games to smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and the PS3 and PS Vita, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14626676/playstation-now-discontinued-ps3-vita-smart-tvs"&gt;cut off all those original platforms in late 2017&lt;/a&gt; (coincidence?) to focus on the PlayStation 4 and Windows PC instead. While it recently added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397555/playstation-now-1080p-streaming-support-resolution"&gt;1080p streaming&lt;/a&gt; and a PS5 client, it’s never been offered on Android, iOS, or Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwJK83"&gt;But according to a confidential document unearthed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from the&lt;em&gt; Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple had insider knowledge of Sony’s upcoming launch. Apple had heard about a “[not-yet-announced] mobile extension of an existing streaming service for PlayStation users, streaming access to over 450+ PS3 games to start, with PS4 games to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNqD5z"&gt;A handful of PS4 games launched on PlayStation Now in July 2017, but the presentation notes that the service is “only PS3 games right now,” suggesting Apple got tipped off about more than just the move to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQIpa4A3pK-VvvsiYvmq1HnKaDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080005/ps_now_mobile.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;PlayStation Now is listed as a “mobile” subscription&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;in a document labeled “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL — ATTORNEY’S EYES ONLY”.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iINjJs"&gt;Why did Apple bring this up? It’s smack dab in the middle of an explanation of Apple’s plans to launch its own game subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, which wouldn’t be announced until two years later. At the time, Apple was preparing to target 30 top game studios and ask for as many as “a few hundred titles” to add.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qmpcx0LbKMEsJ6luj_yXTZMCeag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080073/apple_games_subs.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple describes its “game subscription service,” which would launch as Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqhn65"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;I wrote that Sony squandered the opportunity to be a leader in cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;, despite being the first major company to recognize its potential, buying &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of the early startups (Gaikai and OnLive) that proved out the idea. But despite Apple’s resistance to cloud gaming on the App Store — read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826297/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-streaming-exclusives-iphone-ipad-gamepas"&gt;my new story about what happened with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; — there’s an intriguing possibility that Sony isn’t giving up yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816087/sony-playstation-5-game-subscription-service-xbox-games-pass-now-spartacus"&gt;Sony reportedly now has a Project Spartacus&lt;/a&gt; that would bundle its cloud gaming service with a PlayStation Plus subscription, and it would bring original PS1 games and “eventually” PS5 games to the service too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRSIgj"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Jason Schreier’s scoop for &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t mention mobile phones at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmK2x1"&gt;While it’s possible Sony read the room and decided it wasn’t worth fighting Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17392470/apple-rejects-valve-steam-link-app-store-ios-game-steaming"&gt;the way Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft, and Google did for mobile access, it might also be that Sony decided to focus on selling more consoles instead — if you do have a PS4 or PS5 in your house, the company’s PS Remote Play app already lets you stream it (perhaps even &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2021/09/14/ps4-remote-play-ps5-games-over-mobile-data-update-download-broadcast-ios-android-iphone/"&gt;over cellular&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429291/sony-ps5-remote-play-dualsense-apple-mac-iphone-ipod-ipad-apple-tv"&gt;to a wide array of Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Android. You can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;stream a new PS5 to your old PS4&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a new lease on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5t8Yy"&gt;Sony wouldn’t comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has reportedly closed an Apple Store in Texas due to a COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GlyHyyF7X96_IbKY3YI_o7wC6Yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251538/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me4IJw"&gt;Apple closed one of its Southlake, Texas retail stores Wednesday after many staff members contracted COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-store-texas-closes-covid-outbreak-rcna8000"&gt;according to NBC News&lt;em&gt;’ &lt;/em&gt;Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. A manager told employees Wednesday that 22 staffers “have shared that they’re positive for COVID-19,” NBC News reported, and four of the store’s 151 employees reported positive cases right after Black Friday. The store will be closed through Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnEhom"&gt;NBC News’ report highlights a few worrying trends about the Southlake location. One employee said they had previously raised concerns about being unable to keep social distancing. He and another employee said the store was packed “shoulder to shoulder” on Black Friday. And a manager at the Southlake store apparently had asked employees to come even if they had called in sick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ftJJuM"&gt;NBC spoke with four current and former employees at the Southlake store who said they’ve received calls from their manager encouraging them to come to work, even when they called out sick. In two of these cases, the employee had taken the Covid-19 survey and the results said not to come in. The manager did not respond to requests for comment from NBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N5atlM"&gt;Apple’s official policy requires retail staffers to wear masks and to take a COVID-19 survey before they go to work. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;must also be tested for COVID-19 frequently&lt;/a&gt;: unvaccinated workers must be tested twice per week and vaccinated workers tested once per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrpsZe"&gt;The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Schiffer reported this month for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that many of Apple’s frontline workers find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic"&gt;working conditions to be untenable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDHSeq"&gt;Most of Apple’s corporate employees will return to the offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;in a hybrid work pilot&lt;/a&gt; beginning February 1st. The company originally announced its hybrid work plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; with the intent to return in September, but that was delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;to January&lt;/a&gt; and then to February. Facebook parent company Meta has also recently updated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1469042247450513410"&gt;its return to work policies&lt;/a&gt;. Offices will fully reopen on January 31st, but staff will be able to defer coming back by three to five months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhones will be able to give owners a detailed history of what parts were replaced</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtlW9ELdJJfE6WjGpt5djeHB1uw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249538/akrales_170620_1794_0029.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tG9xHD"&gt;Apple is about to add a new feature to iPhones informing users if the device was previously repaired and whether a genuine screen or battery was used (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/ios-15-2-shows-a-service-history-of-repaired-parts-in-your-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;via 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212878"&gt;parts and service history&lt;/a&gt; section will appear (under Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; About) with the upcoming iOS 15.2 update for iPhone — providing some insight and peace of mind for buyers of used or refurbished iPhones hoping to get a proper quality OEM unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtEGWM"&gt;The new update expands on a previous feature that can tell if a screen or battery was not genuine, now adding them in one place and even including a date on when the service was performed. Since the release of the iPhone 11, Apple started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884287/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-display-screen-replacement-verification-warning"&gt;including a warning&lt;/a&gt; when an aftermarket (ungenuine) screen was installed. Now iPhones as old as XR models can warn if a battery is ungenuine, while iPhone 12 and 13 can call out more including the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEQGbR"&gt;Earlier versions of iOS on the iPhone 13 threatened to make screen repairs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764251/iphone-13-screen-replacements-break-face-id-microsolder"&gt;more difficult&lt;/a&gt;, requiring microsoldering to avoid a warning label and deactivated Face ID sensors. iOS 15.2  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786274/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes"&gt;updates the process&lt;/a&gt; to allow repairs by users or a third-party shop without a complaint from the device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYqxLcQmlwwcUAJm69RK6XKJJzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075322/ios15_2_repair.001.jpeg.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15.2 with new Parts and Service History section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6HOm0z"&gt;Buying and selling used iPhones is a huge market, but it can be scary not knowing if a device will have a low-quality aftermarket&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;battery that might overheat — or annoying if the screen you get has terrible colors because it’s not really OLED (when it should be). This could happen if a repair was performed by a third-party shop that is not in Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20838307/apple-iphone-repairs-parts-independent-shops"&gt;independent repair program&lt;/a&gt; (IRP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EitIXY"&gt;With the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22787245/apple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy"&gt;Self Service Repair&lt;/a&gt; from Apple, customers will have a means of getting genuine parts and repairing iPhones at home. Since this method of service is supported by Apple, newer iPhones on iOS 15.2 repaired through self-service will acknowledge that a repair was done and the parts are genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeoeUB"&gt;Trading in or reselling iPhones might get more difficult, though — if aftermarket parts were used, then companies and independent buyers now have the leverage to quote lower values if a repair is reported in settings. This can lead to very &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368541/apple-trade-in-phobio-macbook-white-spots"&gt;frustrating situations&lt;/a&gt; especially if a phone needs to be sent in for inspection to confirm a trade-in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9Jrql"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZGJla"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkbnAo"&gt;Apple’s widely rumored upcoming mixed reality headset will make use of 3D sensors for advanced hand tracking, according to analyst Ming-chi Kuo, whose latest research note has been reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/apple-ar-vr-hand-gesture-interface/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/kuo-apples-mixed-reality-headset-to-have-advanced-hand-gesture-detection/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The headset is said to have four sets of 3D sensors, compared to the iPhone’s single unit, which should give it more accuracy than the TrueDepth camera array currently used for Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Cerzh"&gt;According to Kuo, the structured light sensors can detect objects as well as “dynamic detail change” in the hands, comparable to how Face ID is able to figure out facial expressions to generate Animoji. “Capturing the details of hand movement can provide a more intuitive and vivid human-machine UI,” he writes, giving the example of a virtual balloon in your hand flying away once the sensors detect that your fist is no longer clenched. Kuo believes the sensors will be able to detect objects from up to 200 percent further away than the iPhone’s Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;

Kuo’s note doesn’t mention whether Apple’s headset will use physical controllers as well as hand tracking. Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in January that Apple was testing hand tracking for the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PX4ay3"&gt;Kuo also this week provided some &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/kuo-apple-ar-vr-headset/"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; on what could come after Apple’s first headset. While he expects the first model to weigh in at around 300-400 grams (~0.66-0.88lbs), a “significantly lighter” second-generation model with an updated battery system and faster processor is said to be planned for 2024. The first model will arrive sometime next year, according to Kuo, and Apple reportedly expects it to sell about three million units in 2023. That suggests the initial product may well be expensive and aimed at early adopters. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s upcoming macOS 12.1 update will fix the MacBook Pro’s notch and menu bar issues</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7MdMDA"&gt;Apple’s upcoming macOS 12.1 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"&gt;will fix some odd interactions&lt;/a&gt; between its new MacBook Pros’ notched displays and menu bar apps, which should no longer be blocked behind the notch, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/macos-12-1-fixes-notch-obscuring-menu-bar-icons/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1U6zX"&gt;Previously, some users had reported issues where menu bar icons could end up getting pushed behind the notch in the event that too many were open. Or, as Apple’s changelog describes the issue, prior to macOS 12.1, “[menu] bar extras may be obscured by the camera housing on 2021 MacBook Pro computers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ttbR5Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple seems to have forgotten it built a notch in the MacBook Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="CRGxsh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WTF HAHAHAHA HOW IS THIS SHIPPABLE? WHAT IS THIS?! &lt;a href="https://t.co/epse3Cv3xF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/epse3Cv3xF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Quinn Nelson (@SnazzyQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143510111059968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VtDbB8"&gt;The bug admittedly was rare to begin with, requiring that users had enough menu bar icons (referred to by Apple as “menu bar extras”) to reach from the right side of the display to the notch’s location, but particularly large menu bar apps (like iStat Menus) could accomplish the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ula5Va"&gt;In addition to fixing the menu bar / notch bug, the new update also brings a few other issues, including HDR problems with YouTube and MagSafe bugs on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7IiAG"&gt;macOS 12.1 is still in beta, but given that the company has seeded the release candidate version of the software to developers, the update (and the bug fix for the notch issues) should be rolling out to all users in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
