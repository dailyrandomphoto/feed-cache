    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jawll"&gt;People always look at me weirdly when I say that I use Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; with my iPhone 12 Pro. But it’s a pairing that makes sense for me: First, I need something that sits entirely within my ear, without a stem that’s going to risk being knocked about by a bike helmet’s strap. Second, they work with Samsung’s companion Galaxy Buds app on iOS, so I can still access their advanced features. And third? I just love that they’re shaped like little kidney beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN0gX0"&gt;But if you were to try the same thing with Samsung’s newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt; Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; you’ll find Samsung’s iOS earbud companion app hasn’t been updated to support them. Samsung wants you to buy a Samsung phone, so it appears to be locking you out of numerous little features, much like how Apple’s AirPods Pro are similarly restricted if you try to use them with an Android phone, or how OnePlus’ earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445641/oneplus-buds-standalone-app-android-phones"&gt;were missing key features when used with non-OnePlus Android devices&lt;/a&gt; at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAZ1Yk"&gt;While I can happily use the iOS companion app to tweak and update last year’s Buds Live, the same app won’t be able to recognize Samsung’s latest buds. If you’re an iPhone user, it’s an annoying enough situation that it feels like Samsung isn’t interested in your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FP8Xh3"&gt;But how bad is the ecosystem lock-in with Apple and Samsung’s latest earbuds really? Here are the specific ways you’ll miss out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="JEv4OF"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2’s ecosystem lock-in versus AirPods Pro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ayrNuH"&gt;Before we get into the details, here’s a chart showing which features you get with the AirPods Pro and Galaxy Buds 2, depending on whether you use the earbuds with iOS or Android: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zLOEmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10703823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2JRPBf"&gt;The good news is that basic functionality, like being able to listen to music and access playback controls from the buds themselves, is available regardless of whether you use the earbuds on iOS or Android. So too can you control features like noise-cancellation and transparency (aka ambient) modes, which aim to block out and let in outside noise, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWIJOZ"&gt;But lacking a companion app or native operating system support means you simply can’t access certain earbuds’ features if you’re not using the earbuds on their own platform. Most AirPods Pro controls are built directly into iOS, for example, while Samsung’s Galaxy Buds companion app doesn’t support its recent true wireless earbuds on iOS. That means you’re out of luck if you want to update either earbuds’ firmware on a competing operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQgz4m"&gt;These are the kinds of features that you could grow to miss in the long term, especially if you ever need to troubleshoot any problems. If your earbuds encounter a bug, there’s no chance of getting updated firmware to fix it if you’re on Android. Or if you suspect that your AirPods Pro’s battery is draining too quickly while listening to music on an Android phone, you don’t have an official battery indicator to troubleshoot what’s going wrong (although iOS’s system-level battery indicators mean this isn’t a problem for iPhones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esT1Pz"&gt;In some cases there are third-party apps designed to fill in the blanks. For example, the Android apps &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotarrow.assistantTrigger"&gt;Assistant Trigger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pro.vitalii.andropods&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;AndroPods&lt;/a&gt; promise to show your AirPods battery life and allow you to access your phone’s voice assistant such as Google Assistant with a squeeze or tap of the AirPods’ stem. But user reviews of both apps are mixed, and they’re clearly no replacement for official native support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GvE4V_5ezL8yYRQFDA0uPj1WyN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21700189/IMG_0628_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The beans offer iOS app sport, why not newer earbuds? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QqURmv"&gt;It’s also technically possible to use a tap-and-hold gesture to activate Siri when using Samsung’s Galaxy Buds with an iPhone. But in order to do so you have to customize the earbuds’ gesture controls, which default to activating noise-canceling and ambient modes. And customizing those controls relies on a companion app that doesn’t exist on iOS. It restricts easy access to a feature that, depending on your needs, you might rely on every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7O0yF"&gt;Apple and Samsung’s ability to lock you into an ecosystem extends to features that aren’t directly comparable as well. First is that the AirPods’ ability to automatically switch between audio sources only works on Apple devices like iPhones and iPads. It’s not able to automatically switch between an iPad and an Android phone, for example. Samsung’s Buds 2 don’t have a comparable feature, although the company included a version of it on the Buds Pro where it could automatically switch between Samsung phones and Samsung tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSsLSt"&gt;Next, both Apple and Samsung technically have features that let you find their respective earbuds using an app, but they’re very different. Apple’s is called “Find My” and currently it can show you where you might have left your AirPods on a map, based on the last time they were connected to your own phone. With iOS 15 this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;functionality is expanding&lt;/a&gt; by tapping into Apple’s Find My network, meaning other people’s Apple devices will also be able to report the location of your headphones. Either way, the feature is technically cross-platform since it’s accessible via a browser, even on Android. Samsung doesn’t have any of this map-based functionality, although like Apple its companion app includes a simpler option to have your earbuds play a sound to help you find them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3dA6vq"&gt;There are also differences in how the earbuds handle pairing. On iPhone, simply opening an AirPods case near your phone is enough to get the pairing process started. But even when you’re on a Samsung phone you have to head into its companion app before you start the official pairing process. Google has its own version of the AirPods’ pairing process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/31/16584442/fast-pair-android-easy-simple-bluetooth-pairing"&gt;called Fast Pair&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s yet to become ubiquitous almost four years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNKQVa"&gt;None of these missing features will fundamentally stop you from using either pair of earbuds to listen to music on the “wrong” platform. But it’s a hassle to have to hunt the Play Store for unofficial third-party apps to unlock basic functionality, or borrow a friend’s phone just to do a firmware update. Especially when you know you can avoid these problems with a different pair of earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bTLSH8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Looks easier and easier to stick around in iPhone land&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWsiKh"&gt;And that might be what Apple and Samsung are banking on: if they can convince you to pair their earbuds with their smartphones in blissful harmony, then they know they’ve given you one more reason to stick around in their ecosystem. Yes, it’s easy to replace that outdated iPhone with an Android by itself, but then your AirPods, and maybe even your Apple Watch, and HomePod all won’t work as well. In the end, it makes it look easier and easier to stick around in iPhone land. Sure, Apple might sell a few thousand more AirPods if they worked better on Android, but at the risk of losing much-costlier iPhone sales. It might be why Samsung recently revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22620869/galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-3-samsung-wearable-google-smartwatch-tizen-one-ui"&gt;its new flagship Google watch won’t work with the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAPT4f"&gt;In portable audio land, it all means that, unless you have a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;strong preference for Apple or Samsung’s earbuds, you’ll get a more complete experience with less hassle by pairing like with like. You can fight ecosystem lock-in all you want, but sometimes it’s just easier to go with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YcmKfd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHmCZn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows users can now manage their iCloud Passwords</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aH7ddqUMVde7u-tV2OpUm4KrLDQ=/0x0:860x573/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733156/2021_08_16_11_16_34_Settings.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nN9avk"&gt;If you sync your iCloud Passwords with Windows, Apple’s new, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/manage-passwords-icwa812f1681/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;dedicated iCloud Passwords app&lt;/a&gt; is going to give you some much-needed new abilities. The app, which comes with the iCloud for Windows 12.5 update, lets you search through your saved passwords, update them, add new ones, and delete login info you no longer want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTE5xN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/manage-passwords-icwa812f1681/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;Apple’s documentation&lt;/a&gt; explains how to manage your iCloud Passwords using the new app, but it’s relatively straightforward. You can access the app from the Start menu, and make any changes to your passwords that you need. Those changes will then be synced to your Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-dwpODws0adrDZaDAVXCNNKrA-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786016/2021_08_16_11_18_47_iCloud_Passwords.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud Passwords running on Windows 10 (note that all data included in screenshots is example data). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NIyX9i"&gt;Apple rolled out some support for iCloud Passwords on Windows earlier this year. In January, an iCloud for Windows update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22259720/apple-icloud-passwords-chrome-browser-extension-released"&gt;added support for a Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; that would let you use the passwords already in your iCloud Keychain, as well as add new ones to your keychain from Chrome. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;That extension&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263118/apple-icloud-windows-password-sync-version-removed"&gt;a very rocky rollout&lt;/a&gt;, but it eventually became available to users in a somewhat working state. It’s still part of iCloud for Windows 12.5’s password management system, and the 12.5 update brings support for an Edge version of the extension as well (in theory, Chrome extensions work with Edge, but &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj?hl=en"&gt;reviews on the Chrome web store&lt;/a&gt; indicate that this wasn’t the case for iCloud Passwords). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cinlsh7quWa9LdhYGMmxPZseqW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785982/2021_08_16_11_20_37_Login_on_Twitter___Twitter.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chrome extension lets you use passwords saved in your iCloud Passwords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hfRvka"&gt;This update makes using iCloud to sync your passwords significantly more viable if you’re someone who jumps between Windows and Mac (or who uses Windows and an iPhone). Being able to see and search through a list of your saved passwords gives you more flexibility than the browser extension, and being able to manage your passwords means that you don’t have to jump to an Apple device if you want to make changes to your logins. While the new app isn’t as fully featured as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;dedicated password manager&lt;/a&gt; (or, indeed, as Keychain Access on Mac), it’s certainly better than the little-to-no management abilities Windows users had before for their iCloud Passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNDC1N"&gt;The 12.5 update for iCloud for Windows is available now, and you can get it by going to the Windows Store and searching for updates. If you don’t already &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/set-up-icloud-passwords-icw2babf5e03/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;have iCloud Password syncing set up on your Windows machine&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have to enable it in iCloud Settings before you can use the password manager, but the process is relatively simple. Doing so requires an Apple account that uses two-factor authentication, along with an Apple device running iOS 14 / macOS 11 or later, which you’ll need to get the security code. You’ll also have to &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learn-about-windows-hello-and-set-it-up-dae28983-8242-bb2a-d3d1-87c9d265a5f0#ID0EBD=Windows_10"&gt;have Windows Hello set up&lt;/a&gt; — but don’t worry if your computer doesn’t have biometric authentication, because you can also use a PIN. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Apple rejections, FlickType gives up on popular iPhone keyboard for the blind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehPF9Mv6r-SkJs0p-Rf_L-oS06g=/0x84:2016x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733034/flicktype_photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Upup9"&gt;If you’re a blind or low-vision iPhone user who relies on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flicktype-watch-keyboard/id1359485719"&gt;the FlickType keyboard&lt;/a&gt; to type, I’ve got some bad news — you’re about to become a casualty of the fight between Apple and one of its staunchest critics. Developer Kosta Eleftheriou has announced that he’s discontinuing the iPhone keyboard portion of his app, and says that keyboard will automatically be removed in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HZuEIQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's with a heavy heart today that we're announcing the discontinuation of our award-winning iPhone keyboard for blind users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple has thrown us obstacle after obstacle for years while we try to provide an app to improve people's lives, and we can no longer endure their abuse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cH1HCQzeP1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cH1HCQzeP1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292830523744257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52ZqXA"&gt;You might have heard the entire app is going away, and that’s not actually true, Eleftheriou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;In January 2020, he added a swipe-to-type Apple Watch keyboard to FlickType that saw the app skyrocket to the number one paid app in the entire Apple App Store for a time, and that app will continue to exist and continue to contain that Apple Watch keyboard.  Eleftheriou says the app has nearly half a million downloads, but he doesn’t have a breakdown for how many of those users rely on the iPhone keyboard specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screenshot says “please enable full access for FlickType under the iOS Settings app.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNV7oi5-nRWEhBwZwSWfE_mixVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786073/13_twS_I.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple provided Eleftheriou with this screenshot “proving” the app doesn’t work without access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eXfm4m"&gt;If his name sounds familiar, that’s because Eleftheriou is the same developer who’s been poking holes in Apple’s App Store image for months, pointing out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;how egregious scams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars"&gt;secret gambling dens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;review fraud&lt;/a&gt; keep making it through the company’s filters even though they’re pretty easy for anyone to root out. His fight became personal long before today: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he sued Apple in March&lt;/a&gt; for some seemingly shady behavior, alleging that Apple erected roadblocks to his FlickType keyboard in order to convince him to sell the technology to Apple for a discount, all while scammy mobile keyboard apps flourished on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfBxvV"&gt;Now, says Eleftheriou, Apple has suddenly decided to reject FlickType yet again — and for a reason that he’s already successfully argued with them in the past. He shared the rejection letter with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a pretty simple dispute: Apple says the keyboard needs to work even if a user doesn’t give it “full access” to network access and other iOS features. But Eleftheriou says that if Apple actually tried to use the app, or consulted their earlier discussions, they’d see that the keyboard works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N9YGH5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We tried reaching out to Apple a total of 9 times last week, with no success. At this point they seem to be ignoring our attempts to contact them directly, despite previously explicitly telling us to "feel free" to contact them if we need "further clarification".&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292841676398596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aqyvCH"&gt;To be clear, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html"&gt;own developer guidelines specify&lt;/a&gt; that “full access” isn’t a problem: the only dispute here is whether the app continues to work if a user turns it off — which it does, says Eleftheriou, if you turn VoiceOver on. “They’d have to try it as a VoiceOver user, something that they don’t seem to bother doing. I’ve had several rejections in the past because the reviewer didn’t know anything about VoiceOver,” Eleftheriou says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KuUMt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292843928821765"&gt;As his Twitter thread explains&lt;/a&gt;, Eleftheriou sees this as the final straw for this specific feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEntkf"&gt;“Our rejection history already spans more than FOURTY pages filled with repeated, unwarranted, &amp;amp; unreasonable rejections that serve to frustrate &amp;amp; delay rather than benefit end-users. And dealing with App Review isn’t just time-consuming. It’s also very emotionally draining,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nE4HhJ"&gt;Eleftheriou stops short of accusing Apple of retaliation, in a separate chat over Twitter DM. “I can only speculate about this rejection, but I’ve recently had many more rejections I haven’t talked about yet, and them ignoring my attempts to reach them is also new,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local and anonymous social media app Yik Yak is back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BQsWfGP4HEdBIJluaFa0viqaFo=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732537/YikYakApp_2021_Aug_16.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="knVMtm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/"&gt;Yik Yak&lt;/a&gt; — the anonymous, local social media app that only shows posts from people in your immediate area — has &lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/the-yak-is-back"&gt;returned from the grave&lt;/a&gt; with new ownership after shutting down four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5ryfF"&gt;According to the app’s relaunched website, the new incarnation of Yik Yak bought the rights to redevelop the service in February 2021, with the aim of providing a local social media network that’s free from the “labels” that dominate communication on other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMk0hp"&gt;The new app resembles the original version of Yik Yak from 2014: users can post and comment on short text posts that are only able to be viewed within a five-mile radius. Like Reddit, posts can be upvoted and downvoted, and a separate “hot” feed compiles the top post from the past 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WFVnUx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  ICYMI: After a 4 year hiatus, Yik Yak is available in the App Store again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Anonymity, location-based, the hot feed &amp;amp; more — everything you used to love about Yik Yak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now available on iPhone in the US — more countries and devices coming soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/2B2NCKamdV"&gt;https://t.co/2B2NCKamdV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HUAKh4elcA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HUAKh4elcA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yik Yak (@YikYakApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YikYakApp/status/1427310464585900035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H7OIAS"&gt;Originally launched in late 2013, the app was a flash-in-the-pan success (particularly at college campuses) for most of 2014, when it was valued at $400 million by investors. But while the anonymity made it popular for college students, Yik Yak also was rife with bullying and harassment. In early 2016, in an effort to get things back on track, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/8/11175886/yik-yak-handles-usernames"&gt;Yik Yak added optional social media handles&lt;/a&gt;, which were made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12492152/yik-yak-redesign-local-yakkers-status-updates"&gt;mandatory in August&lt;/a&gt; of that year, effectively removing what had made the service unique. The original incarnation of Yik Yak ended up shutting down in early 2017, when it was sold for $1 million to Square for its engineering talent and IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYUghr"&gt;The new Yik Yak looks to be taking a serious stance on bullying and harassment on its platform, though — something that the original incarnation of the app failed to do. The new owners have posted an extensive list of its “&lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/community-guardrails"&gt;community guardrails&lt;/a&gt;,” which include prohibiting sharing of personal information, “anything that could be construed as bullying, abuse, defamation, harassment, stalking, or targeted hate or public humiliation,” and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvctrq"&gt;The company also notes that bullying, hate speech, threats, or other violations of any the community guardrails or terms of service can lead to an immediate ban from the platform. And posts that receive a total score of -5 will be hidden from view, too, to ensure that negative or harmful content isn’t surfaced further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub5lhG"&gt;The new Yik Yak is currently only available to download on iOS for users in the US, but the developers are promising to expand to more countries and devices soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jury decides Apple should pay $300 million in patent dispute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xHGXD5zXS4Fkr3EsLfkpLlpt6E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69727943/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2gSIul"&gt;Apple must pay $300 million in royalties following a retrial in a patent dispute, a Texas jury determined Friday. As &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/jury-awards-optis-300-million-second-patent-trial-against-apple-2021-08-13/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the jury found that Apple should pay patent company Optis Wireless Technology and its related companies because the technology Apple used in its iPhones, iPads, and Watches allegedly infringed Optis’ patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVPd4m"&gt;Last year, a jury &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/apple-told-to-pay-506-million-in-texas-patent-trial-verdict-1"&gt;awarded Optis $506 million&lt;/a&gt; in the dispute, but a judge vacated that award in April, and ordered a new trial focused on damages only. US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said the first jury had not been allowed to consider whether the amount was awarded on the “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory,” or FRAND, terms required in standard-essential patent cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krgeS3"&gt;The five patents involved in the case once belonged to LG, Panasonic, and Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/14/apple_google_patents/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, but were obtained by Optis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RcXsO"&gt;An Apple spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday that the company was disappointed by the verdict and plans to appeal. “Optis makes no products and its sole business is to sue companies using patents they accumulate,” the spokesperson wrote. “We will continue to defend against their attempts to extract unreasonable payments for patents they acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mzv9dF"&gt;Last month &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results"&gt;Apple reported&lt;/a&gt; record third-quarter revenue of $81.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjHqaD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 15th 12:10PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comment from Apple spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s controversial plan to try to curb child sexual abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6z3Ld4HzH_dTWyXO8gjMRz1XVXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69725913/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple ‘s plan to scan iOS devices for CSAM imagery has proven controversial | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why privacy experts are concerned&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="dc6dr1"&gt;When Apple announced changes it plans to make to iOS devices in an effort to help curb child abuse by finding child sexual abuse material (CSAM), parts of its plan generated backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twOtsC"&gt;First, it’s rolling out an update to its Search app and Siri voice assistant on iOS 15, watchOS 8, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey. When a user searches for topics related to child sexual abuse, Apple will redirect the user to resources for reporting CSAM, or getting help for an attraction to such content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Jhnc4"&gt;But it’s Apple’s two other CSAM plans that have garnered criticism. One update will add a parental control option to Messages, sending an alert to parents if a child age 12 or younger views or sends sexually explicit pictures, and obscuring the images for any users under 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhX8SA"&gt;The one that’s proven most controversial is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;Apple’s plan to scan on-device images to find CSAM&lt;/a&gt; before they images are uploaded to iCloud, reporting them to Apple’s moderators who can then turn the images over to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the case of a potential match. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;Apple says the feature will protect users&lt;/a&gt; while allowing the company to find illegal content, many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;Apple critics and privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt; say the provision is basically a security backdoor, an apparent contradiction to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;Apple’s long-professed commitment to user privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says its iCloud scanning will rely on multiple child safety groups to address privacy fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ia0PCmtxH75mxbYkGpWC9GLEEtk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723200/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VHOhKl"&gt;Apple has filled in more details around its upcoming plans to scan iCloud Photos for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) via users’ iPhones and iPads. The company &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Security_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf"&gt;released a new paper&lt;/a&gt; delving into the safeguards it hopes will increase user trust in the initiative. That includes a rule to only flag images found in multiple child safety databases with different government affiliations — theoretically stopping one country from adding non-CSAM content to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAlWLt"&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS and iPadOS releases will automatically match US-based iCloud Photos accounts against known CSAM from a list of image hashes compiled by child safety groups. While many companies scan cloud storage services remotely, Apple’s device-based strategy has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;drawn sharp criticism&lt;/a&gt; from some cryptography and privacy experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNC7E2"&gt;The paper, called “Security Threat Model Review of Apple’s Child Safety Features,” hopes to allay privacy and security concerns around that rollout. It builds on &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-executive-defends-tools-to-fight-child-porn-acknowledges-privacy-backlash-11628859600"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; with Apple executive Craig Federighi, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623336/craig-federighi-apple-icloud-photos-iphone-ipad-csam-scanning-auditability"&gt;outlined some of the information&lt;/a&gt; this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GWcN8"&gt;In the document, Apple says it won’t rely on a single government-affiliated database — like that of the US-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC — to identify CSAM. Instead, it will only match pictures from at least two groups with different national affiliations. The goal is that no single government could have the power to secretly insert unrelated content for censorship purposes, since it wouldn’t match hashes in any other database.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A venn diagram with one circle labeled “Apple Child Safety Organization #1 hash list,” one labeled “Child Safety Organization #2 hash list,” and the overlap labeled “Apple only uses the intersecting hashes of two or more child safety organizations.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gfZtkVvGXvygEumbVZ86p-PnRRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781290/Screen_Shot_2021_08_13_at_3.35.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Security_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xv3FdB"&gt;Apple has referenced the potential use of multiple child safety databases, but until today, it hadn’t explained the overlap system. In a call with reporters, Apple said it’s only naming NCMEC because it hasn’t yet finalized agreements with other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XByiVR"&gt;The paper confirms a detail Federighi mentioned: initially, Apple will only flag an iCloud account if it identifies 30 images as CSAM. This threshold was picked to provide a “drastic safety margin” to avoid false positives, the paper says — and as it evaluates the system’s performance in the real world, “we may change the threshold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqgB8O"&gt;It also provides more information on an auditing system that Federighi mentioned. Apple’s list of known CSAM hashes will be baked into iOS and iPadOS worldwide, although the scanning system will only run in the US for now. Apple will provide a full list of hashes that auditors can check against child safety databases, another method to make sure it’s not secretly matching more images. Furthermore, it says it will “refuse all requests” for moderators to report “anything other than CSAM materials” for accounts that get flagged — referencing the potential for using this system for other kinds of surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBhTTw"&gt;Federighi acknowledged that Apple had introduced “confusion” with its announcement last week. But Apple has stood by the update itself — it tells reporters that although it’s still finalizing and iterating on details, it hasn’t changed its launch plans in response to the past week’s criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade is getting a new Castlevania game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bI9eCXa-GFkTcZnrkrg8Qzu4fsE=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721901/15_5120x2880.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRo2hd"&gt;With the exception of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;an anime series on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, the last few years have been quiet when it comes to the gothic action series &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;. It looks like that’s about to change, though: developer Konami just announced a new game coming exclusively to Apple Arcade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Z3fkCp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432584"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WFIiYt"&gt;The new title is called &lt;em&gt;Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s described as “an original side-scrolling action game that features a line-up of classic, well-loved characters from the series’ hit catalogue.” The graphics certainly look like a departure for the series, but there are some notable names on board, including character designer Ayami Kojima and composer Michiru Yamane, both of whom have contributed to the series since the iconic &lt;em&gt;Symphony of the Night&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Grimoire of Souls &lt;/em&gt;doesn’t have a release date, but Apple says that it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ygusmb"&gt;If the name sounds familiar, it’s probably because Konami previously soft-launched a version of &lt;em&gt;Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt; in Canada &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2020/07/09/castlevania-grimoire-of-souls-release-date-closing-canada-ios-android-free/"&gt;before shutting it down last year&lt;/a&gt;. That iteration was free-to-play with added microtransactions, a feature that is absent from all Apple Arcade games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXzwRr"&gt;The news comes at a fairly busy time for Apple’s subscription games service. Today sees the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616888/fantasian-part-2-apple-arcade-release-date"&gt;part two of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;a classic RPG from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585353/apple-arcade-tetris-beat-skate-city-tokyo-monster-hunter-stories"&gt;the music-focused &lt;em&gt;Tetris Beat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is also on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="tPKT38"&gt;Apple executive Craig Federighi says iCloud Photos’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;plans to scan for child sexual abuse material&lt;/a&gt; (or CSAM) will include “multiple levels of auditability.” In &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-executive-defends-tools-to-fight-child-porn-acknowledges-privacy-backlash-11628859600"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Federighi — Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering — offered new details about its controversial child safety measures. That includes a claim that the iPad and iPhone’s device-level scanning will help security experts verify that Apple is using the system responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZeals"&gt;Like many companies with cloud storage services, Apple will check iCloud Photos images against a list from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), looking for exact matches with known CSAM pictures. But unlike many services, it will run searches on the device, not fully remotely. “Imagine someone was scanning images in the cloud. Well, who knows what’s being scanned for?” Federighi said, referring to remote scans. “In our case, the database is shipped on device. People can see, and it’s a single image across all countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DjUrf"&gt;Federighi elaborated slightly on how this might give people confidence Apple isn’t greatly expanding the database to include material besides illegal CSAM, particularly in countries with restrictive censorship policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vMPNRl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re making sure that you don’t have to trust any one entity, or even any one country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5anlI"&gt;“We ship the same software in China with the same database we ship in America, as we ship in Europe. If someone were to come to Apple [with a request to scan for data beyond CSAM], Apple would say no. But let’s say you aren’t confident. You don’t want to just rely on Apple saying no. You want to be sure that Apple couldn’t get away with it if we said yes,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. “There are multiple levels of auditability, and so we’re making sure that you don’t have to trust any one entity, or even any one country, as far as what images are part of this process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7s92c"&gt;Apple has previously said that it’s only rolling out the system in the United States and that it will &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/06/apple-says-any-expansion-of-csam-detection-outside-of-the-us-will-occur-on-a-per-country-basis/"&gt;consider launching in other countries&lt;/a&gt; on a case-by-case basis. The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple will ship the hash database of known CSAM on the operating system in all countries, but it will only be used for scanning in the US. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; further clarifies that there will be an independent auditor who can verify the images involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7QNze"&gt;Federighi also offered more detail on when the scanning system will notify an Apple moderator of potential illegal content. Apple has said before that a single match won’t trigger a red flag — a measure intended to prevent false positives. Instead, the system generates “safety vouchers” for each match and alerts Apple if the number hits a certain threshold. Apple has declined to publicize the exact threshold, saying this could let abusers evade detection. But Federighi says it’s “on the order of 30 known child pornographic images.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFkTE8"&gt;Some security experts have offered cautious praise of Apple’s system and acknowledged the importance of finding CSAM online. But many have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;criticized Apple’s abrupt rollout&lt;/a&gt; and a lack of clarity on how the system worked. In his interview with the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Federighi acknowledged the confusion. “It’s really clear a lot of messages got jumbled pretty badly in terms of how things were understood,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft’s flagship subscription combines Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold in one attractive package. | Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xJPIOV"&gt;If you’re a gamer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22530941/xbox-game-pass-e3-2021-bethesda-yakuza"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best deals in town. Microsoft’s popular subscription service — which touted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250795/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-growth-microsoft"&gt;more than 18 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year — has been dubbed the “Netflix of video games,” namely because it provides access to more than a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fgames%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DTnL5HPStwNw%26ranSiteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-NG1EGejqTZh7KDYouebdEQ%26epi%3DTnL5HPStwNw-NG1EGejqTZh7KDYouebdEQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__0thgbaanw9kfqhhygvquhus6yn2xr3dfzggxj29e00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528TnL5HPStwNw-NG1EGejqTZh7KDYouebdEQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_0thgbaanw9kfqhhygvquhus6yn2xr3dfzggxj29e00&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22622197%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscription-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-apple-watch-series-6-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hundred Xbox titles&lt;/a&gt; for a flat, monthly fee. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate takes things a step further, combining Xbox Game Pass with Xbox Live Gold, giving subscribers access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, EA Play titles, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, which is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;widely available on iOS and PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQE5WR"&gt;Typically, a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate runs $45. And while &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate%2Fcfq7ttc0khs0%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s ongoing promotion&lt;/a&gt; will knock the price down to $1 for new subscribers, it’s not available for returning players. Thankfully, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers can purchase a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global%2Fbest-pick&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22622197%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscription-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-apple-watch-series-6-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month subscription at Eneba for $30&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. The sale price will fluctuate around $30.85 (with service fees), but if you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;XGPU3VERGE&lt;/strong&gt;, the price should come in just shy of $30 at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e1485R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MdR7AP"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t a direct sequel to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s better off for it. The midrange Chromebook hits all the right marks, while retaining an affordable price tag that becomes even more appealing when you factor in its &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-13-3-qled-touch-screen-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-fiesta-red%2F6448525.p%3FskuId%3D6448525&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;current sale price at Best Buy: $600&lt;/a&gt;. For the money, you get a functional laptop with a gorgeous QLED display, all-day battery life, and a bright, eye-catching finish that’s sure to turn heads no matter where you go (it’s also available in a “mercury gray”). It’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; you can buy, and it comes with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a Core i3 processor, which should be enough for everyday use. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only does the Series 6 boast a wealth of health features and an always-on display, but it comes with built-in sleep tracking and a strong ecosystem of third-party complications, a hallmark no other smartwatch manufacturer has yet to replicate. The watch’s deep integration with the iPhone only bolsters the wearable’s appeal alongside watchOS 7, a mobile operating system built to handle all the basic features we’ve come to expect in a smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZaCmI"&gt;Normally $430, you can purchase the 44mm, GPS-enabled &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/b3Do0m"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6 at Target right now for $360&lt;/a&gt;, one of the better prices we’ve seen on this particular model in recent months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
