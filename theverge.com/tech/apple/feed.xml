    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>

      &lt;img alt="The best phone of 2021: iPhone 13, Pixel 6, iPhone 13 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 13 Mini, Pixel 5A, and Samsusng Galaxy Z Fold 3." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QthQgLW_qoVuV8_gEhvnwYZf3x4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_Fall_2021.12.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="k1bPmC"&gt;Due to a confluence of factors in 2021 — from production delays thanks to the ongoing pandemic, rising costs of labor and components, to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; — prices for flagship phones have been higher than ever. The absolutely premium phones, like the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G, now cost well over $1,000, or about the price of a good laptop. Even if you’re willing to shell out top dollar for the best smartphone of 2021, it’ll take lots of luck and patience to get one into your hands this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxr7Qk"&gt;Thankfully, you no longer have to spend a huge amount to get something amazing, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $600 to 800 this year. In fact, if you like Android, the best phone for your buck this holiday season is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$599 Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. For everyone else, our pick for the best overall phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;$829 Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ugNMR"&gt;And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even less. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I7S1w"&gt;A great smartphone should last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. After all, upgrade cycles are slowing down: people are holding onto their phones for longer, so they’re looking for features that will last a few years. Believe it or not, most top phones are pretty neck and neck in terms of their user experience and features these days — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 can do it all: it hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="63WdF8"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="meCBEI"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2xAh9b"&gt;Out of the four iPhone 13 variants that Apple launched in 2021, the $829 iPhone 13 (unlocked) hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWggHi"&gt;It has a new processor, a bigger battery, 128GB of internal storage, and uses the same large camera sensor as the acclaimed iPhone 12 Pro Max, but you wouldn’t know it from its compact size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtOjH2"&gt;In fact, the 13 looks almost identical to the 12 but is just a bit thicker and heavier, with substantially bigger camera bumps and lenses that swapped places. (No, you won’t be able to reuse your iPhone 12 case for the 13.) Otherwise, it has the same overall design, a brighter 6.1-inch OLED display, the same 12-megapixel selfie camera, the same MagSafe wireless charging, the same water and dust resistance (IP68), and the same support for both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks. On top of all that, it comes in five colors (including pink), one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfcR8W"&gt;What’s different with the iPhone 13’s new A15 Bionic chip is that it should still feel fast in years to come, but it’s difficult to measure significant speed improvements with iPhones. The new chip helps the iPhone 13 run more efficiently, which lasts well into the evening without needing a top up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZlh8X"&gt;Using the same camera sensor that made the iPhone 12 Pro Max the best smartphone camera for photos and videos in 2020, the iPhone 13’s main wide-angle camera has &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jyZ2NJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt; For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BzMqAW"&gt;significantly improved. Photo details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional. Its ultrawide camera, on the other hand, has only been minorly updated for better low-light performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwNczv"&gt;Video quality is also great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow-mo and handles them all super well. It even lets you record videos in Cinematic mode, which helps you smoothly switch focus between subjects by changing the depth of field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymvwy3"&gt;The iPhone 13 starts with 128GB of storage. Because its storage is not expandable, and depending on how you’ll be using the phone, you might want to bite the bullet and upgrade to the next tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice: it offers similar performance, design, camera features, and (sometimes) better battery life than other iPhone 13 models, for less money.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 (right) is Google’s first flagship phone, and it’s already right up there with the best from Apple and Samsung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1IUao"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5xQzeU"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HijJkz"&gt;The Pixel 6 is a lot of phone for $599. As Google’s first true flagship phone since 2019, the Pixel 6 gets many things right and is right up there with the iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in camera quality, overall performance, and battery life. When you consider the fact the Pixel 6 is a good $200 less than its rivals, it’s simply the most value-packed flagship phone for Android fans this year. Sorry, OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKm2Sq"&gt;You can tell the Pixel 6 from the Pixel 6 Pro by its slightly smaller 6.4-inch, 1080p OLED flat display and bolder color choices like two-tone red or green (black is also an option). For a relatively big phone, the Pixel 6 is not too thick yet feels substantial. That said, its glossy body is super slippery, so you’ll need to budget for a third-party case (forget the Google ones, they aren’t worth the money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j9tZm"&gt;At the heart of the Pixel 6 is Tensor, Google’s first proprietary mobile processor that is on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip inside other Android flagships. Tensor allows the new Pixel to lean into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to learn some new tricks. You can use the Magic Eraser to remove photo-bombers from your photos, take &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fUDR1d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s simply the most value packed flagship phone for Android fans this year.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2QbW6"&gt;photos that better reflect real skin tones, as well as use Google Assistant to handle automated calls for you. The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, and runs the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12 software&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s new Material You theming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmSNYb"&gt;Inside its sizable rear camera bar are dual cameras, 50-megapixel wide and 12-megapixel ultrawide cameras, along with a laser detection autofocus sensor for low-light and depth. Unlike the Pixel 6 Pro, the 6 doesn’t have a telephoto camera. Still, its images are very good in both normal and low light and very competitive with the best from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;The Pixel 6 has a 4,614mAh battery (should last two days for light users), supports Qi wireless charging, and has some protection from rain storms (IP68). Its main weakness is a slow under-screen fingerprint scanner, and the phone lacks a face unlock option. While not perfect, the Pixel 6 is an all-around good phone for $599 and is our pick for the best Android phone to buy right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IyREhz"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ny6ArzeT0abX7U_ZwlO2TJfb_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863285/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same camera system, so either Pro models will be good for content creation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ovaxxT"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dctrOj"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BudYKV"&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same top-of-the-line camera system this year, and they are our pick as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;iPhone for photos and videos. This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system — you get the same experience with either of the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CewoNz"&gt;The three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, particularly in low light. If photo and video quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 13 Pro is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYma8C"&gt;The 13 Pro has a physically larger camera sensor compared to prior models that allows its main 12-megapixel camera to gather more light and produce better-quality images, especially in dark or challenging lighting conditions. Its ultrawide camera is able to take stunning macro photos, thanks to its new close focus capability. In addition, the 3x optical &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fKFScJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jxI2pw"&gt;zoom on the telephoto lens makes for great portrait photography. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization make for stable and beautiful videos, even in low light. You can even shoot and edit videos directly in &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212832"&gt;ProRes&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone 13 Pro (as long as you have a 256GB or higher storage model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;For those looking for the best Android camera system available, we recommend getting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$899 Google Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, especially if a telephoto lens is a must. We pitted the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769156/iphone-13-pro-vs-pixel-6-pro-camera-comparison-photos"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro cameras in a comparison video&lt;/a&gt;, and the results are pretty evenly split. While the Pixel 6 Pro’s video capabilities are still behind the iPhone, it can more than hold its own on stills, and its telephoto camera is even better than the iPhone 13 Pro’s. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini has all the same cameras and features as its siblings but packs a smaller battery for light users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fEdsxM"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fRQPIp"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yu67SC"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 13 Mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 13 Mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALR5kS"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the Mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="OR8NaU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rLWG16"&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery that probably won’t last a power user through a whole day without a charge. It’s really designed for a lighter user who isn’t glued to the phone all day. Otherwise, the Mini is the same phone as the iPhone 13: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 13 Mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has a built-in S Pen and a battery that can last two days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cGzRrM"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="osyeHY"&gt;If you’re looking for a premium phone with a stylus and amazing battery life, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is still the one for you. Because this device originally launched in 2020, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;rumors that Samsung will be discontinuing the series in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iczza1"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant 6.9-inch OLED display is 4K in resolution and supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM, so it can perform without a hiccup. Together, these elements make the S Pen sing by cutting down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G41prk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOPhPE"&gt;the latency between inking and what you see on-screen. While its triple rear camera system is not as good as the iPhone 13 Pro’s, it’s still one of the most advanced you can get. With its 4,500mAh battery, you can expect about two days of use before you’ll need a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;Although you can technically use the S Pen with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, it isn’t built into the phone like it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. If you want your S Pen and phone in one clean color-coordinated package, you’ll need to get the Note 20 Ultra while it’s still available.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the perks of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is its 1.9-inch exterior screen for widgets and notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PoZM83"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kSVtiN"&gt;Best flip phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PDkqPQ"&gt;Sick of smartphones that only get bigger and heavier when all you want is for some new ways to use your phone? Samsung’s third go at a flip phone seems to strike the right balance of whimsy, technical prowess and price that make the Galaxy Z Flip 3 appealing to mainstream users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdAmnF"&gt;For $999.99, this 4.2-inch pocketable device can transform into a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display that is bright and has a fast 120Hz refresh rate. The screen can also be used as a split screen for multitasking. When closed, you can use the 1.9-inch outer second screen, which displays handy widgets like app notifications and audio player controls without making you open the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="77t8Vy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxcXpK"&gt;The Galaxy Flip 3 has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM as any other flagship phone released in 2021. Battery life is also just fine, providing between four and five hours of screen time between charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLTJff"&gt;It’s too bad its dual cameras did not get an upgrade from the previous iteration. Both the 12-megapixel standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, as well as the 10-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, take good but not great photos. Due to the Z Flip 3’s form factor, it can double as a mobile tripod for the cameras, which makes for some fun new ways to take photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;$1,400 Motorola Razr (2020&lt;/a&gt;), the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone. It’s hard to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;how durable this foldable screen&lt;/a&gt; will be, but at least you can be among the first to find out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZtA5cf"&gt;Best phone under $300 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o8vynA"&gt;Not everyone needs a premium flagship phone, and even a budget phone can be a delight to use these days. If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S will defy your expectations for what a budget should look and feel like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI5uYL"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’s vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional security option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xa3xoR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’s vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WI8Y8C"&gt;While the 20S’s camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1ZKhC"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even a $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, good battery life, for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A will receive three years of OS and security updates from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R9fmdS"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r9nZkH"&gt;Best Android phone under $500 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nicCXJ"&gt;The Google Pixel 5A is a bit like the hidden track on the b-side of an album: those who are in the know love it, but most casual Android users may not even know it exists. It’s only available from Google’s online store because carriers don’t carry the Pixel 5A, but it’s worth the effort to get this hidden gem of a $450 5G phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62kYmA"&gt;The Pixel 5A has made some key upgrades from the discontinued Pixel 5: its screen is now a bit bigger at 6.3 inches, it has a slightly bigger battery at 4,680mAh, and it provides some dust and water protection (IP67). Otherwise, it has the same beloved camera sensor, Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, 6GB RAM, as well as 5G connectivity (sub-6GHz 5G). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="DFlWgw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Google Pixel 5A is a bit like the hidden track on the b-side of an album&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xRhhw"&gt;Like its predecessors, the Pixel 5A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with flagships that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually a few years old now. It means the Pixel 5A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the benefits of getting a Pixel is that it’ll be first in line for the latest Android updates. Google has committed to providing three years of OS and security updates to the 5A. Android 12 is already available for it, and it will be one of the first models to get the next version after that.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third time’s the charm for the $1,800 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, but it’s still too expensive for most.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xBwOAb"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PiiTyN"&gt;Best folding phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fWZzLE"&gt;If you’ve been waiting patiently for the foldable phone to mature before dropping some serious coin for one, this might be the year to get the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22738082/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-folding-phone-dual-screen-multitasking"&gt;Microsoft’s dual-screen Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt; is a distant second to the Fold 3, in this early two-device race.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ADSUM"&gt;The Fold 3 is Samsung’s third-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a skinny smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WScnfM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cJXDD"&gt;browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone. It also has an extra 6.2-inch screen on the cover with 2268 x 832 resolution, so you can use it for quick tasks when you don’t have enough time or space to unfold the main screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WmHwM"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 3 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, all its cameras are sub-par, and its 4,400mAh battery is a bit small to power so many screens. While the Fold 3 is water resistant (IPX8), the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;durability of its foldable screen and hinge&lt;/a&gt; remains an open question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 3 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. At $1,800, you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half. If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 3 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rsSZIW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fO6Eoz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Business Essentials subscriptions support small businesses that only use Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Business Essentials" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/214E4eCO0GHP-fXd2cfEyioGrgM=/0x33:1500x1033/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70141412/Apple_Apple_Business_Essentials_11102021_1500.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Business Essentials | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="epZ2WM"&gt;This week Apple unveiled another beta program, but instead of offering early previews of software for your Mac, iPhone, or iPad, it’s a new initiative &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/business/essentials/"&gt;called Business Essentials&lt;/a&gt;. In line with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;recent shift toward selling services&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a subscription package aimed at small businesses with three different plans and a move that has been anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.fleetsmith.com/fleetsmith-acquired-by-apple"&gt;since it acquired the device management platform Fleetsmith&lt;/a&gt; a little over a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOgfna"&gt;Starting at $2.99 per device per month, they can cover employees across a single device, more than one device, or a more expensive plan that covers multiple devices and adds more cloud storage. An AppleCare+ package will be available when it launches full in spring 2022, adding 24/7 phone support, access to training, and on-site repairs from Apple-trained technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cpUisD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OushE7mq0Ak?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mgUa2W"&gt;Like many other device manage platforms, it streamlines the onboarding process, preinstalled apps, as well as management of security settings like FileVault for disk encryption and Activation Lock to secure devices if they’re lost or stolen. There’s also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212754"&gt;a new Business Essentials app&lt;/a&gt; for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that puts all of the various settings in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSjMeu"&gt;I spoke to Vox Media senior VP of IT, Oumar Sall, who points out that it could be beneficial for startups during periods of high growth. Particularly while dealing with more remote workers, it can help get new employees up and running as quickly as possible even if a business doesn’t have the other parts of its network fully formed yet. It could also be helpful for schools if Apple’s existing &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/education/k12/it/"&gt;School Manager&lt;/a&gt; system isn’t a good fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bYN5BX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vox Media’s Eric Arredondo on working as IT support","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22444109/it-support-slack-macbook-keychron-zendesk"},{"title":"How Apple’s enterprise app program became the new Wild West of mobile apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18232583/apple-ios-developer-enterprise-program-store-mobile-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H9JRyT"&gt;It also has the advantage of being available from Apple itself. However, it’s unlikely to challenge mainstays in the industry since, at least so far, it is limited by the number of employees supported, and it isn’t available across different platforms. There’s also the question of how exporting data works if a company wants to leave iCloud, endpoint security management, and the other issues that can crop up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nsP40"&gt;Jamf is one of those companies, as it provides device management to a number of organizations, including Vox Media. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4468740-jamf-holding-corp-jamf-ceo-dean-hager-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;On an earnings call Friday&lt;/a&gt; after Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-introduces-apple-business-essentials/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Dean Hager said that he expects the service will help improve Apple’s built-in management tools that Jamf also relies on, without competing directly with many features Jamf provides. If Business Essentials helps kickstart adoption among small businesses or startups, it gives them a basis to buy even more Apple devices and services as they grow, even if they eventually move to more on-premises support or another provider altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly relying on states to pay for digital ID rollouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MSYOHsRuYaylI_sE51MNxp6dFS0=/129x0:2871x1828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70141339/license.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ftM9p0"&gt;Apple will soon let users in participating states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;digitally store their driver’s licenses&lt;/a&gt; or state IDs on their iPhone’s wallet, but according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/apple-sticking-taxpayers-with-part-of-the-bill-for-digital-id-rollout.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, the initiative will be partially funded by the states — and their taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPDAbi"&gt;CNBC got ahold of contracts signed by Georgia, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Kentucky, and found that Apple will maintain tight control over its deployment. It reports that Apple gets “sole discretion” over a number of aspects of the program, including its device compatibility, the service’s launch date, states’ marketing campaigns, as well as how states report on the initiative's performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qXNBn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple gets “sole discretion” over a number of aspects of the program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R1qbG0"&gt;The contract also says that each state will have to “allocate reasonably sufficient personnel and resources (e.g., staff, project management and funding) to support the launch of the Program on a timeline to be determined by Apple.” This includes testing out the service on different types of Apple devices “in accordance with Apple’s certification requirements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9AUXV"&gt;Additionally, states are responsible for promoting the digital ID service to citizens, as well as encouraging its adoption among members of the federal and state government, including local police and the Internal Revenue Service. State agencies are required to “feature the Program in all public-facing communications relating to Digital Identity Credentials,” which is subject to Apple’s review and approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNp0wG"&gt;And if that isn’t enough, Apple is holding states accountable for the authenticity of the program’s identity verification. The contract absolves Apple from any discrepancies in its verification system, stating: “Apple shall not be liable for any Verification Results, and Agency acknowledges that all Verification Results are provided ‘AS IS’ and without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, regarding its accuracy or performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i54w6P"&gt;Despite being an Apple-led program, taxpayers are footing the bill to roll out this single-platform digital ID program in their states — even if they don’t have an iPhone. The contract clearly says “except as otherwise agreed upon between the Parties, neither Party shall owe the other Party any fees under this Agreement,” meaning that the participating states will be funding its promotion and adoption using taxpayer’s tender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQQcCq"&gt;Having a digital ID program — especially one paid for by states — raises a number of concerns, the most obvious one being security. Users are expected to transfer their most sensitive documents to their iPhones, essentially establishing their identities on a single device. If implemented incorrectly, it sets a precedent for surveillance; what happens to user information when a digital ID is scanned at an airport or at an age-restricted concert? This type of tracking information is tempting to abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDQ6WF"&gt;Much like what Apple is trying to do with its digital ID program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516653/clear-identity-health-covid-airports"&gt;Clear, a digital identification app&lt;/a&gt;, serves as a fast pass to the front of security lines in airports and sports stadiums, or as an app to store proof of your COVID-19 vaccination. As an article by &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/clear-conquered-u-s-airports-now-it-wants-to-own-your-entire-digital-identity-15d61076e44d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, Clear considered selling user data in the past, but instead uses that data to promote relevant ads to users. No matter how Apple chooses to leverage this data, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652051/apple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15"&gt;digital ID system is making its way to Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, Iowa, Maryland, and Utah, in addition to the four aforementioned states, very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG3sqF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest beta fixes macro mode confusion for iPhone 13 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5W9JkytYNdBsQxGz5QGhWFNy_2M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70134949/vpavic_210916_untitled_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b87aYY"&gt;Apple’s latest iOS 15.2 beta is making the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro mode simple by adding a button to let you turn it on and off (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/12/iphone-gets-macro-mode-toggle-in-camera-app/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The icon, which looks like a little flower, pops up whenever you’re close enough to an object to take a macro photo and lets you easily switch between having Auto Macro mode on and off without having to go into settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzPf58"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/aD0QQhaPAwQ?t=324"&gt;video from &lt;em&gt;ZolloTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;shows how the feature currently works in iOS 15.2 beta 2: if you have  Auto Macro turned off, the button will appear when you get close to something. Tapping it seems to basically turn Auto Macro back on, and your phone will switch into macro mode. Tapping the button again turns Auto Macro off and switches you back to the regular camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yggmfd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10861923"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5kTaPV"&gt;When the iPhone 13 launched, some reviewers said the automatic transition to macro mode could be jarring, as the phone was switching lenses without showing that the change had happened in the UI (the lens indicator doesn’t change from 1x to 0.5x as it normally would). Apple fixed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713135/iphone-13-camera-features-prores-macro-ios-15-1-beta-3"&gt;by introducing a toggle&lt;/a&gt; (Settings &amp;gt; Camera &amp;gt; Auto Macro) that let you turn off the automatic switching, but that made things a little complicated. Just switching to the ultra-wide camera and getting close to your subject would get you different results than macro mode would — to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745578/iphone-13-pro-macro-mode-how-to"&gt;fully replicate the macro effect&lt;/a&gt;, you’d also have to manually zoom in to 0.9x. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jxO38N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This change makes things simple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1I1VST"&gt;The change in 15.2 beta 2 makes things simple. If you don’t want to think about it, you can leave Auto Macro on, and your iPhone 13 Pro will take a macro picture if you’re close enough to an object. If you’d prefer finer control, or find the switch jarring, you can turn Auto Macro off but still have easy access to the mode if you want it through the button that will pop up when the phone thinks you’re trying to take a macro picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSgYI9"&gt;While this is probably how the system should’ve worked from the start, it’s good to see that it’s finally making its way on to phones. Hopefully this fix will stay the same through the beta process and be part of the 15.2 final release.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4dFljI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NJIBjo"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5095084519&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VCtrBf"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter, along with managing editor Alex Cranz and senior reporter Sean O’Kane, discuss electric vehicle startup Rivian becoming a publicly traded company after executing one of the biggest initial public offerings in history. This leads to a discussion on how Rivian got to this point where other EV startups have failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QP0FZb"&gt;There’s a whole lot more news covered on the show, especially from Apple. This week, we saw:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Invasion’s creepy alien reveal was worth the wait</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Invasion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45mkUDYvyjJwkq1vLDS5JPcRWdM=/480x0:3360x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132841/Invasion_Photo_010508.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GFjmVk"&gt;It took half of a season, but we’re finally here: the aliens have shown themselves in &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt;. The Apple TV Plus series got off to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"&gt;a slow start&lt;/a&gt; when it debuted in October. The first handful of episodes were tense character drama, focusing on a few characters spread across the globe, each of whom was dealing with some personal issues in addition to the titular attack on the planet. That was all well and good, but the sci-fi elements were so scant that you could blink and miss them. No one even said the word “alien” until episode five. But now that we’re halfway through the season, that’s changed. The latest episode finally shows the creepy off-world invaders, and it has given the show the purpose it needs — along with some scares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dbcps"&gt;If you haven’t watched the show yet, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is probably best described as &lt;em&gt;This is Us&lt;/em&gt; mashed up with &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. It takes a big idea — aliens are invading seemingly every part of the world — but explores it through a series of small, intimate stories. There’s a mother learning about an unfaithful spouse, a US soldier on his own in Afghanistan, and a bus full of English teens that crashes in the middle of nowhere, among others. Each of these characters is not only dealing with their own shit but also the early stages of the invasion. No one even knows what’s going on. Amidst power outages, mysterious objects crashing from space, and the occasional synchronized nosebleed, there’s a lot of misplaced blame on “the Russians” or unspecified terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZFX68"&gt;Viewers, of course, have known all along that it’s aliens. It’s right there in the title of the show. But the hints for the actual characters living through the invasion have been sparse, sporadic, and confusing. Now things are becoming more clear. In episode five, we got a tease of just how strange these invaders might be when a doctor named Aneesha (played by Golshifteh Farahani, whose distraught performance remains a highlight of the show) notices a spiky little blob while stitching up a patient. It’s gross and dangerous-looking. It also seems alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSdAaW"&gt;It turns out that was just a taste. In episode six, after a brief detour that started out as a hunt for food and ended up as a short-term residency at a field hospital, Aneesha returns to the house her family has been staying in, only to find it empty and boarded-up like something from a zombie movie. Except it’s not empty; &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is lurking around. You see and hear it in brief, terrifying flashes. The whole house will start to shake unexpectedly. Giant, spider-like legs scurry in the background. At one point, you can see the full creature but as a tiny reflection in a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="invasion" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l8WLDrnD0FTv56naoDQp2I_dQKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005242/Invasion_Photo_010503.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UTLTEV"&gt;Like everything else in &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt;, the build-up is slow and methodical. But it works: it’s almost like a horror movie, one that takes its time before showing the monster in its full, terrifying glory. And the reveal here is wonderful, as you watch a tortuous sequence where the creature terrorizes the family as they attempt to make an escape. Seeing the alien doesn’t take away from its mystery or menace at all. In fact, it just raises more questions about how these spindly black blobs managed to coordinate a planet-wide attack and what exactly it is they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW7K68"&gt;What I’m saying is, the slow-burn reveal was worth it. Not only are the aliens unexpected and scary, but their arrival also makes almost every character’s arc more interesting. Before, as engaging as many of the personal stories were, it felt a lot like a bunch of people floundering around during the end of the world. Now there’s some purpose. That’s especially true with Mitsuki Yamato (Shioli Kutsuna), an obsessed Japanese space technician who appears to be the only one close to figuring out what’s going on with the invaders. More than just moving the plot forward, though, the blobby bugs from space have introduced a tangible threat. It’s no longer just some weird stuff going on — it’s a bunch of killer spiders sneaking around every city on the planet for unknown reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dncTTx"&gt;I’m glad I stuck it out to see the aliens. But they do introduce a new problem for &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; because now the show has to do it all over again. The first five episodes were a slow build-up that ultimately paid off, but we’re just over halfway through the story at this point, so there’s plenty to go. The reveal worked, but the next test will be seeing if the show can connect all of its many stories into something satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>World’s first USB-C iPhone sells on eBay for $86,001</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMn_XL__RTecS6p-9n3QoN3_Ueg=/0x0:768x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70131929/msedge_8C53o6F5aS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OXksGg"&gt;A modified iPhone X that has a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F165161363347&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22777988%2Fusb-c-iphone-x-lightning-ebay-auction-86001" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sold on eBay&lt;/a&gt; for the princely sum of $86,001. The phone, which is the work of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722123/first-iphone-usb-c-port-robotics-engineering-student-custom"&gt;robotics engineering student Kenn Pillonel&lt;/a&gt;, can use the physical connector for both charging and transferring data. But Pillonel warns that the buyer &lt;a href="http://vi.vipr.ebaydesc.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItemDescV4&amp;amp;item=165161363347&amp;amp;t=0&amp;amp;category=9355&amp;amp;seller=geeken&amp;amp;excSoj=1&amp;amp;excTrk=1&amp;amp;lsite=0&amp;amp;ittenable=false&amp;amp;domain=ebay.com&amp;amp;descgauge=1&amp;amp;cspheader=1&amp;amp;oneClk=2&amp;amp;secureDesc=0&amp;amp;oversion=f3d3fc33"&gt;shouldn’t use the groundbreaking device as a regular phone&lt;/a&gt;, take it apart, or update the OS — any of which could risk breaking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2qoMU"&gt;The fact that the mod has sold for over eighty times its original sale price shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Although Pillonel has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759704/usb-c-iphone-hack-mod-open-source-github-repo-ken-pillonel-design-video"&gt;open-sourced his work on the project&lt;/a&gt; in a Github repository containing technical details, CNC instructions, and information on the custom PCB the design uses, actually replicating the modification is no mean feat. Especially since it involves installing extra circuitry into the phone’s chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MvNfAL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVEQJNRmfDQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dWWc7L"&gt;The auction started at just $1, but bidding had reached over $3,000 by the end of its first day, before quickly climbing into the tens of thousands. There were also a couple of much higher bids of around $100,000 that were retracted before the auction came to an end. It attracted a total of 116 bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXaW8w"&gt;Although the prototype has now been sold, Pillonel has previously said he intends to continue working to improve elements like the USB-C iPhones’ fast-charging, waterproofing, and adding support for USB-C accessories. With the design open-sourced, and the prototype released into the world, it’s a project that’ll hopefully become a team effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szUoit"&gt;If you’d like to hear more about Pillonel’s project, check out his appearance on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772024/vergecast-podcast-usb-c-future"&gt;the Vergecast&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 has often recieved the biggest discounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year — and we’re bound to see far more as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday approach&lt;/a&gt;. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwEyX"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 by $30, bringing the price down to $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $199 instead of $229. Like the 38mm model, it’s also available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-42mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101062" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, though, not at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="title"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version with a silver aluminum case and an abyss blue sport band for $270 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F305879066&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other configurations — as well as the larger, 44mm model with GPS — are currently only available at full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. Right now, for instance, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red variant &lt;/a&gt;at Amazon right now for $349, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm model with GPS is your fancy, it’s available in white, navy, and red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $379, slightly more than its best-ever price. The red configuration is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for the same price, as is the black model at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-44mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band%2F-%2FA-80606297" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hZHCRf"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. There are very few deals to speak of right now, however, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model with a green Sport Band and green aluminum casing for $390 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a $10 discount. The 45mm model with GPS is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in red for $420.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vE4BzP"&gt;Although both deals are slight, it is possible that we’ll see bigger discounts as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday, especially given Amazon has taken between $30 and $40 off a number of different sizes and configurations of the Series 7 in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4m59DD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s unexciting 2021 Mac and iPhone software prove it should take a break from annual OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qRq7SHCJLRJiiCNR0ulhJp0cwg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130116/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZnL4b"&gt;Apple’s fall software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, are officially out in the world for everyone. But Apple’s latest software has arrived with more of a whimper than a bang; the two updates aren’t so much bad as they are &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Which has me wondering: why is Apple still clinging to its annual release schedule at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lXVnu"&gt;There are two problems that Apple’s annual cadence causes. The first, as is the case this year, is that iOS and macOS are increasingly mature operating systems with fewer issues to fix or missing features to add. Which, in turn, means that there are fewer opportunities for sweeping upgrades like there were in the early days when the iPhone getting copy and paste support was headline news. Short of Apple changing its mind about how its operating systems and the rules that govern it work — &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;like when it allowed for third-party email and browser apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;in iOS 14 &lt;/a&gt;— there’s just less room for big additions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s8ks4Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple macOS 12 Monterey review: the best is yet to come","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"},{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pjaj8I"&gt;Second is the fact that — because Apple silos off virtually all its updates, big or small, to help pad out the “big” iOS release — smaller but useful quality of life improvements often get stuck waiting around months for the fall cycle to line up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXjwLc"&gt;Take iOS 15, which added a grid view and the ability to blur a background in FaceTime, core features that have already been a key part of Zoom and Google Meet’s toolkits for making larger virtual conversations more organized. Neither appears to be the kind of earth-shattering, OS-level feature that would require waiting for a new version of iOS, but Apple saved the updates to be part of iOS 15 anyway, despite the fact that they undoubtedly would have been more useful during the height of the pandemic when video chatting was more heavily in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV2Lpr"&gt;Apple has, in fairness, already started to trend away from its one-and-done updates, if only because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;it’s missed its self-imposed deadlines&lt;/a&gt; multiple times. Major features for iOS and macOS like SharePlay or Universal Control have been delayed from the initial dot-zero builds for more development time. Point releases have gotten more and more important, too, used to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936510/apple-ios-13-2-airpods-pro-compatible"&gt;debut new emoji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265019/apple-ios-13-5-out-now-unlock-iphone-face-mask-id-exposure-notification-covid-19"&gt;critical Face ID updates for better mask support&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;Apple’s high-profile App Tracking Transparency requirement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MNSTz5"&gt;To solve the issues of lackluster annual updates, Apple should do two things. First, it should continue to build out point releases with additional features throughout the year or even unbundle app updates from its annual releases entirely. Did the FaceTime team come up with a great new feature that’ll make pandemic chatting easier? Release it when it’s ready! Second, it should start to space out its major software releases, waiting an extra year or two between iOS or macOS versions to ensure that when it does release a “new” operating system, there are actually big changes to be excited about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzPZiA"&gt;Spaced out software updates wouldn’t even be a new idea for Apple, at least on the macOS side of things. Apple spent almost a decade spacing out OS X releases every two years before it brought back annual releases with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mZbllQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spaced out updates aren’t a new idea for Apple, either&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxo47T"&gt;Sure, Apple does get some benefit from its current cadence. On a basic level, bundling iOS and macOS updates gives Apple a single, cohesive marketing push, a package of features that it can point to and say, “Look, here are all the ways the new software makes your life better.” The annual releases also mean that Apple can count on journalists writing roundups of the new features every year at WWDC and reviews of those new features in the fall, and Apple might have to risk that consistent coverage if it changes things up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j59DEI"&gt;But while the boosted public awareness is nice, I doubt that Apple would be missing out on much if it spaced out annual releases. New iPhones are not sold on the strength of having Apple’s new software installed; customers praised the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Airs&lt;/a&gt; because of their battery life and processing speed, not because they shipped with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck9iBC"&gt;People install iOS and macOS updates, but outside of the tech sphere, it’s not something that people are &lt;em&gt;eager&lt;/em&gt; to do. More often than not, Apple updates are installed out of a grudging frustration at push notifications and a desire to banish alert bubbles, not because Focus modes allow power users to set up more granular do-not-disturb settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1NH9kX03zjMNoq8Xubjz6hdSLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864029/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wl2uuH"&gt;Spacing out iOS and macOS updates for when Apple actually has big marquee features to show off (like it did during the OS X days when it actually &lt;em&gt;charged&lt;/em&gt; for new updates) could go a long way to fixing that unenthusiastic update cycle. Less frequent iOS updates could help make sure that there’s actually something to get excited for, like a new visual design or substantial new features (like Siri). Additionally, Apple would get more time to develop new versions of its software, which could theoretically cut down on the bugs and glitches in the final versions of whatever it does ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Crtfgq"&gt;Smaller updates, meanwhile, can be doled out over the year when they’re ready, instead of waiting to cluster every minor update into a massive, overwhelming grab bag once a year where they’re more likely to be overshadowed anyway by the more substantial parts of the new operating system. More gradual updates that aren’t tied to a single major release is an idea we know works, too, because it’s how every other third-party app on iOS already handles updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0w6US"&gt;But right now, Apple’s system of annual releases leaves it with the worst of both worlds: siloed updates that come too infrequently for minor features while still not having enough major features to be worth the hype. If Apple can’t make macOS and iOS updates more substantial, it might be time to leave the annual release cycle behind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Apple Pay and Touch ID on an external Magic Keyboard can get complicated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mropuN"&gt;Publications like &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/11/apple-pay-doesnt-work-on-your-magic-keyboard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported some odd behavior when trying to use Apple’s Magic Keyboard with Touch ID to authenticate for Apple Pay — specifically, that it won’t work if you’re trying to do it with a MacBook that has its display closed, as it would be while running it in “clamshell mode” hooked up to an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECgIvc"&gt;Obviously, when the MacBook’s lid is closed, you can’t use the built-in Touch ID sensor, so it’s easy to see how this limitation was put in place. But in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Apple sells an external keyboard with the sensor&lt;/a&gt; (starting at &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK293LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english"&gt;an eye-watering $150&lt;/a&gt;), it’s an awkward limitation. That’s especially true given that the keyboard’s Touch ID functionality only works with Apple Silicon-powered Macs and comes with all but the base-level iMac. That means that most of the people buying it will likely be laptop users looking for a way to type while their laptop is docked (maybe even with the screen closed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rYYp5l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If it’s safe enough for an M1 Mac Mini, it’s safe enough for a docked MacBook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fiiiec"&gt;Hopefully Apple will let its users make payments with their external keyboard soon, no matter what the state of their laptop’s lid is. It’s understandable that Apple wants to make sure that payment authentication is a secure process — &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;’s article&lt;/a&gt; mentions a load of other security settings that can affect being able to use Touch ID with Apple Pay — but if it’s safe enough to use with the M1 Mac Mini, it should be safe enough to use with a docked laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6CIcJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated November 11th, 4:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that this behavior appears to be intentional, rather than a bug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
