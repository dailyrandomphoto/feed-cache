    <title>How to use iOS 15’s Focus modes to quickly customize your iPhone’s homescreen </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KscCOx"&gt;Customizing your iPhone’s homescreen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21448712/customize-iphone-home-screen-app-icons-widget-ios14"&gt;took off last year&lt;/a&gt; when iOS 14 introduced widgets and the ability to hide default app icons in favor of your own cool, customized ones. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; opens up a new dimension to homescreen customization, thanks to Focus modes — which give a quick and easy way to hide and reveal groups of homescreens with just a single tap. Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAEVvN"&gt;Focus modes are ostensibly an extension of Apple’s Do Not Disturb mode — the intended idea behind the feature is that you can tie specific homescreens to different use cases, like having a work homescreen with your calendar and email widgets that automatically pop up when you’re in the office, and a regular homescreen with social media apps and music widgets for when you’re off the clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0KNUM"&gt;But since Focus modes let you choose homescreens, you can also use them to quickly swap between a slate of custom-themed icons that you’ve made with matching shortcuts and widgets, without having to manually hide all your homepages every time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKn1sJ"&gt;To use the new feature, you’ll first need to set up a Focus mode — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"&gt;fortunately, we’ve already got a guide here&lt;/a&gt; on how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zATjrr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use Focus modes for notifications on iOS 15","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pSu6wg"&gt;You’ll also need to set up your themed homescreen with widgets and custom icons, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change"&gt;which you can learn how to do here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ptSivc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to customize your iPhone’s app icons","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="AK2oT3"&gt;Once you’ve done all that, you’ll want to go to Settings &amp;gt; Focus, select the specific Focus you want to use to trigger your custom homescreen or screens. Then select the Home Screen menu, toggle the “Custom Pages” switch, and select the homepages you’d like to appear when you enable the Focus mode. Then, all you have to do is turn on your Focus mode, and your phone will turn into your perfect themed style whenever you’d like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfPmGx"&gt;If you’re really willing to go the extra mile, though, you can take advantage of Shortcuts and create an automation that changes your iOS wallpaper whenever you turn on that Focus mode. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work great — at least with the current iOS 15 beta — but it is an option for those willing to muck around with Shortcuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGA1iL"&gt;All of this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still a lot of effort for a themed homescreen, of course. But unless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451649/apple-ios-14-widgets-custom-app-icons-shortcuts-design-jailbreaking-wallpaper"&gt;Apple relents and gives us better customization tools next year&lt;/a&gt;, the new tricks in iOS 15 are the best way to get your homescreen looking stylish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3iBhv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is now available for the lowest price yet in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVt8BXx7RQzj8cl9pq1P2rxEWX8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839164/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is no longer the latest model, but its value is hard to beat. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bblCn7"&gt;The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K has long been considered one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;best streaming devices&lt;/a&gt; on the market, especially if you’re already tapped into Amazon’s ecosystem. The arrival of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662985/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-announced-features-price"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; may complicate things next month, however, if you couldn’t care less about Wi-Fi 6 and improved processing power, the current model should suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I94XLn"&gt;As far as specs go, the last-gen Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K checks all the boxes. The 4K streamer offers everything HDR (Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10), as well as Dolby Atmos sound, access to all major streaming apps, and an Alexa-enabled remote that lets you issue commands without having to shout across your living room. Normally $50, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is now on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfybDjfQNAO#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $35&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the lowest price we’ve seen on the budget-friendly streaming device to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vqNBJZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10710076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjvmu8"&gt;The school year may have already begun, but if you’re still in need of a competent laptop with fantastic battery life, Apple’s M1-equipped MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is back down to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$850 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. Our team thinks the 2020 Air is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, with lightning-fast performance, a tried-and-true clamshell design, and a battery that allows for a full day of work or play before it needs to be recharged via USB-C. Sure, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, September 14th, might bring a few MacBook surprises — potentially even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; — but, in the meantime, the latest model should be more than enough for most people. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HPgnco"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 39,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="03WruI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="riZ5tC"&gt;The original HomePod may have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;met its demise earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but the HomePod Mini lives on. And if you’re looking to pick up Apple’s scaled-down smart speaker in lieu of an Amazon or Google device, Best Buy is currently offering the Siri-equipped HomePod Mini alongside a Philips Hue Lightstrip Plus Starter Kit for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfx5Ky0zA6i#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, a healthy $30 off the bundle’s list price. The starter kit — which includes a power adapter and a Philips Hue Bridge — is also compatible with the HomePod Mini, meaning not only can it use Apple’s compact speaker to play music and answer questions, but it can control your lighting via HomeKit. Like all products in the current Philips Hue lineup, the flexible light strip can showcase an array of 16 million colors, ensuring you can always find one that strikes your mood. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our HomePod Mini review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YXnnJC"&gt;If the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393879/polaroid-go-instant-camera-tiny-selfie-timer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced Polaroid Go&lt;/a&gt; is any indication, instant cameras are far from over. And while Fujifilm might not have been in the game for quite as long as Polaroid, Fujifilm’s current Instax lineup offers a heavy dose of old-school nostalgia at a more affordable price point. Typically $88, you can pick up the Fujifilm Instax Wide 300 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TGOWK3Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon today with delayed shipping for $75&lt;/a&gt;, the second-steepest discount it has received since its debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xDf7F"&gt;Film-wise, the battery-powered instant camera uses a larger Instax Wide film that’s about twice the size of a credit card. That means you can use it for various types of photography, whether it be fashion, landscape, or portraiture. Other noteworthy features include a tripod socket, an image finder, and a dial that allows you to better adjust the focus. It’s not as portable as some of the competition, but if you’re looking for a simple instant camera that’s cheaper than &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Instant-Camera-16670522/dp/B08G5YV1Q6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fujifilm’s newer Instax Square SQ1&lt;/a&gt;, the Instax Wide 300 is a solid contender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTlR3b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744408"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DHNDq4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eXriQ5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHxZDU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eo5hKN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly overcomes Watch Series 7 manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sw59Vp6iuCSMLr2W7hB1I19xOFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838523/apple_watch_series_6_dbohn_821.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year’s Apple Watch Series 6.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hnmit8"&gt;Apple has reportedly overcome the production issues it’s been having with its unreleased smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 7, and will now begin mass manufacturing the device in mid-September, according to a report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/kuo-apple-watch-series-7-ship-late-sept/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes as Apple gears up for a major launch event on September 14th. The fall event will presumably be focused on its latest iPhone models with the new Apple Watch also expected to make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAzCXE"&gt;Late last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had temporarily halted production of its latest smartwatch while it fixed the problems. The issues were thought to be related to the Series 7’s revamped design, which is said to consist of “&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;a flatter display and edges&lt;/a&gt;” than seen on previous models. The new design has reportedly forced Apple to use new production processes that created “reliability issues” in early test runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bzzk4o"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On Watch 7 from last weekend: “We’ll see an announcement during the usual September event alongside the iPhone, but there will be a mix of the models shipping late or in small quantities.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/xkvN14Mv3O"&gt;https://t.co/xkvN14Mv3O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LGjrET"&gt;Now, however, these issues are thought to have been resolved, with shipments expected to begin in late September. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, however, although Apple will announce the new Watch next week, some of the models could ship “late or in small quantities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0nXvk"&gt;As well as the flatter display, the new smartwatch is expected to come with slightly larger 41mm and 45mm cases (up from 40mm and 44mm currently), bumping the largest display from 1.78 inches to 1.9 inches diagonally. The watches are also rumored to have a faster processor and updated wireless tech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music is adding more DJ mixes with new features powered by Shazam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2ZQnxXtXtKmSK-HQGqIANMbcsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838305/acastro_210831_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="quFQc3"&gt;Last year Apple showed how it could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;embed Shazam’s music identification features even more deeply within iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s taking things another step forward within Apple Music. Apple Music initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11235428/apple-music-stream-remixes-dj-mixes-dubset"&gt;introduced DJ mixes and mash-ups in 2016 through a partnership with Dubset Media Holdings&lt;/a&gt; to identify and pay for licensed music within mixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj1TvW"&gt;Now Apple says that by building upon the Shazam tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;acquired in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and partnering with various labels, Apple Music has the tools to identify and compensate individual creators, event promoters, labels, etc. It also allows subscribers to see the names of individual tracks, skip songs within the mix, listen with lossless audio on “most mixes,” and save them to their library for viewing offline. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cNlCJzWhvaL4iJTap0cLoW47L58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839129/applemusic_6001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Music DJ Mix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mQg5zT"&gt;So yes, the same fingerprint ID tech that tells you the name of a song playing in the mall can apparently figure out which festival it’s from, which DJ’s mix it is, and pick out different sounds as they blend together. This is apparently detailed enough, relying on matching across Apple Music’s database of 75 million songs or so, to enable recurring revenue streams for the clubs that host sets and the DJs that make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTumey"&gt;There’s a dedicated genre page for DJ mixes within the Apple Music app, and the company says engagement has tripled in the last twelve months, with over 300 million streams of DJ mixes so far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Un-C3A-NrrZPin1pIWYhKSifwl0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839132/applemusic_600t.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Music DJ Mix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHBPrU"&gt;Apple has already been on a tear adding mixes over the last year or so, including some from Charlotte de Witte, Tiësto, Carl Cox, and others. Studio K7! founder Horst Weidenmueller said in a statement that “Through the partnership with Apple we finally have a place to celebrate DJ-Kicks with additional 14 editions which haven‘t been in the market for over 15 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PERn2v"&gt;Apple Music says it’s commissioning more mixes (following series released earlier this year to mark Black Music Month and Pride) and working closely with DJs to get additional content on the service. This is a new path for getting DJ mixes onto Apple Music alongside older ones like Dubset’s platform. If you already enjoy existing mixes on Apple Music, we’re told they aren’t going anywhere, even if they don’t have all the new features included. Still, it isn’t yet accessible for bedroom DJs or lesser-known names posting their mixtapes to SoundCloud, so there’s some room between this and the wild days of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muxtape"&gt;Muxtape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple won’t let Epic bring Fortnite back to South Korea’s App Store</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLYuio"&gt;Apple says it won’t let Epic Games back in the App Store until they agree to “play by the same rules as everyone else.” Earlier today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665826/epic-games-apple-reinstate-fortnite-ios-korea-app-store-payment"&gt;Epic asked Apple&lt;/a&gt; to reinstate its developer account so that it could re-release the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in South Korea, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; forcing Apple and Google to allow alternate in-app payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BVTLT"&gt;Apple, however, maintains it’s under no obligation to let Epic in the App Store at all. “As we’ve said all along, we would welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,” an Apple spokesperson says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Epic has admitted to breach of contract and as of now, there’s no legitimate basis for the reinstatement of their developer account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="N0dBfY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"All the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Yl5sa3"&gt;The South Korean legislation has not yet gone into effect, but if and when it does, according to Apple, that wouldn’t have any bearing on the company’s process for approving developer accounts. Until Epic agrees to comply with the App Store’s app review guidelines, Apple isn’t going to consider its request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlEPyh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most popular video games in the world, has been unavailable on the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;since August of last year&lt;/a&gt;. Apple ultimately terminated Epic’s developer account in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; update&lt;/a&gt; that dodged the App Store’s in-app payment requirement in order to get around paying Apple the 30-percent cut. Epic then sued Apple and went to trial in May, with a verdict yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fires senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly leaking information</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MpOe7Q2Tn1pUSlE7lq2TwQwZi2A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838038/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xfqpAL"&gt;Apple has fired senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly violating the company’s rules against leaking confidential information. For months, Gjøvik has been tweeting openly about allegations of harassment, surveillance, and workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fO2x3"&gt;“When I began raising workplace safety concerns in March, and nearly immediately faced retaliation and intimidation, I started preparing myself for something exactly like this to happen,” she says. “I’m disappointed that a company I have loved since I was a little girl would treat their employees this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0K58X"&gt;Gjøvik has raised concerns that her office is in an Apple building located on a superfund site, meaning it requires special oversight due to historical waste contamination. She also says that she faced harassment and bullying from her manager and members of her team. More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;she’s begun raising privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; related to Apple’s policies on how it can search and surveil employees’ work phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0nYUnz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sooo, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; has pics of my boobs. During a discovery thing 3yr ago, legal forced me to hand-over all my texts. They refused to let me delete anything, even "fully personal," even when I said "by fully personal I mean nudes." They said they're in their "permanent evidence locker"&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1428495420917837826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4dviGK"&gt;She was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610112/apple-female-engineering-manager-leave-sexism-work-environment"&gt;placed on administrative leave in early August&lt;/a&gt; while Apple investigated some of these concerns — a placement she says she requested as a last resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ayee9"&gt;A member of Apple’s employee relations team reached out to Gjøvik earlier today saying the company was looking into a sensitive intellectual property matter and wanted to speak to her within the hour. Gjøvik said she wanted to keep all communications in writing, and noted she was forwarding the correspondence along to the NLRB, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;where she recently filed a charge&lt;/a&gt;. The employee relations representative responded to say that because she had chosen not to participate in the discussion, they would move forward with the information they had and — “given the seriousness of these allegations” — suspend her access to Apple systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TWdgdI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Any bets if I get a literal knock on my physical door from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; today? &lt;a href="https://t.co/oFqw4VFaGi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oFqw4VFaGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1436078307859066890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXSOMR"&gt;Hours later, Gjøvik received an email that her employment at Apple was being terminated, effective tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDhGAH"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock said: “We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic tests Apple with new request: let us relaunch Fortnite in Korea</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7TZ6sK9iqu192z0_337ftVRFx2I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69837530/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAkiU5"&gt;Epic Games has asked Apple to reinstate its &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer account so it can release the game in South Korea, following the passage of a bill that will force Apple and Google to let apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;use alternative payment systems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IR6usc"&gt;“Epic has asked Apple to restore our &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer account,” Epic said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1436105346184056832?s=20"&gt;in a tweet on the official &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; account&lt;/a&gt;. “Epic intends to re-release &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on iOS in Korea offering both Epic payment and Apple payment side-by-side in compliance with the new Korean law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4mLcOx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Epic has asked Apple to restore our Fortnite developer account. Epic intends to re-release Fortnite on iOS in Korea offering both Epic payment and Apple payment side-by-side in compliance with the new Korean law.&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1436105346184056832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rGDyc8"&gt;It’s unclear if Apple will agree to the request, or if Epic’s intentions are genuine: after all, Epic used Apple’s responses to its prior demands &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;to help spring its original #FreeFortnite legal trap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZdOAo"&gt;In August 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; hours after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;Epic introduced a direct payment system&lt;/a&gt; to the game that bypassed Apple’s own. Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;then sued Apple&lt;/a&gt;, starting off a contentious legal battle between the two companies. The case went to trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;, and we are still awaiting a verdict. The entire time, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t been on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfsEsi"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch exec takes over secretive car project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/glD8qhJRzYoj4Ep5u5PO-wfaL5o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836415/acstro_190902_apple_event_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svd8NW"&gt;Just two days after Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661291/apple-car-chief-ford-doug-field"&gt;hired away Doug Field, the head of Apple’s secretive car project&lt;/a&gt;, the tech giant has tapped Apple Watch exec and former Adobe CTO Kevin Lynch to take his place, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-09/apple-s-watch-software-chief-takes-over-self-driving-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4s1eN"&gt;It’s the latest changing of the guard for the project, known as Project Titan, which has rotated leaders about as much as it has reportedly shifted focus. To wit, Korea’s &lt;em&gt;Maeil Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/apple-chose-to-develop-apple-car-alone/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier Thursday that Apple may no longer be trying to work with other automakers to bring its autonomous electric car to life. Rather, the report states, Apple now plans to go it alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tpGcU"&gt;Lynch started working on the project in July, when he was brought on to help develop the vehicle’s software. He joined Apple in 2013 from Adobe, where he was the company’s chief technology officer. While there, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4124972/adobe-cto-kevin-lynch-allegedly-leaving-to-join-apples-ranks"&gt;he somewhat famously wrote Adobe’s official response&lt;/a&gt; to Apple’s decision to keep Flash out of iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="armIzd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lynch wrote Adobe’s defense of putting Flash on ios, once upon a time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bHNbMM"&gt;Curiously, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;writes that Lynch still reports to Apple’s chief operating officer Jeff Williams and not John Giannandrea, the company’s head of AI — who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;was tapped last year to oversee the car project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gsfmvh"&gt;Field, meanwhile, ran Project Titan from 2018 up until this week when he was poached by Ford. Before that, he spent years at Tesla helping bring cars like the Model 3 to market. (Before that, he worked at... Apple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKqP82"&gt;Launched in 2014 as a reported effort to build an electric car, Apple eventually pivoted the project to focus on the self-driving technology stack. But recently, it seems to have pivoted back, striking up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;conversations with major Asian automakers along the way&lt;/a&gt; (as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;considering buying electric vehicle startup Canoo&lt;/a&gt;). At this point, though, it might as well exist in a quantum state to anyone not actually working on the project. Until it’s observed, the Apple Car is both everything and nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams is getting more hybrid work improvements and Apple CarPlay support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7y_9eAfhshqtkAPmRhp2wS3gjBQ=/127x0:1468x894/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834656/Qd9KibJ.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams with Apple CarPlay support.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RuWeCQ"&gt;Microsoft is continuing to improve the remote meeting experience in Microsoft Teams with better camera support and other improvements that will let you stay in meetings 24/7, if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Wm34P"&gt;After rolling out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Together Mode last year&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;vision for the future of meetings&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Microsoft Teams will soon be updated to support intelligent cameras. These cameras will be supplied by partners like Jabra, Neat, Poly, and Yealink and will enable AI-powered active speaker tracking, multiple video streams, and people recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxrLwu"&gt;They’re the type of cameras that can actually deliver on some of Microsoft’s promises for the future of meetings, enabling cameras in meeting rooms to use audio, facial movements, and gestures to detect who’s in a room and speaking. These cameras are designed to improve and bridge the gap between remote and office meetings, as more and more businesses look to strike a balance between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9I8wnOirDMJGQaHmZFQM0VZdk6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836460/Companionmode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated companion mode for Teams mobile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="taBG5b"&gt;Microsoft Teams on mobile is also being updated to include quick access to chat, live reactions, and the Microsoft Whiteboard. This updated companion mode will also include easier access to controls like mute or camera on / off and will be available “in the next few months,” according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3Fu13"&gt;Speaker coach, an AI-powered Teams feature that monitors your pace during meetings, is arriving in early 2022, and automatic lighting corrections for Teams video meetings will appear in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ydpi8TJL1ztLVbdxdbX3TVfS9w0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836461/cameopowerpoint.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Cameo feature in PowerPoint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UH3Ynd"&gt;Microsoft is also bringing Microsoft Teams to Apple CarPlay this month, so you can be part of Teams calls while driving. You’ll be able to join calls on the road hands-free using Siri, but it appears you’ll only join in audio mode to prevent video from creating a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xG32uu"&gt;It’s not just Teams that’s getting meeting improvements, though. Microsoft is also bringing a new Cameo feature to PowerPoint that lets you integrate a Teams camera into your presentation slide deck. Cameo will start appearing in early 2022 and is designed with remote presentations in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s leather AirTag loop drops to its lowest price yet at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s leather AirTag loops are finally on sale. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zhNQnQ"&gt;Apple’s AirTag accessories are, ironically, often more expensive than the Ultra Wideband-ready Bluetooth tracker itself. Today, however, you can pick up a leather AirTag loop in either brown or red at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932PNC7S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $29&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price Amazon has sold the accessory for since its release in the spring. That’s a great thing given the nature of AirTags, which controversially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;lack a lanyard hole&lt;/a&gt; that would make accessorizing so much easier and likely cheaper, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HqRRM"&gt;The Apple AirTags Leather Loop is made from tanned leather and normally retails for $39. The stylish case allows you to clip your AirTags to backpacks, keys, and other accessories, while securely holding your AirTag in place. There are other third-party options available that are more affordable — Nomad &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-14527713?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-leather-loop-rustic-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sells similar-looking leather loops&lt;/a&gt; for $25, for example — but this could still be a worthwhile deal to consider if you’re a big Apple fan.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can score 50 percent off of their first year of 1Password, which can be used on unlimited devices.

&lt;p id="ebINTO"&gt;Our exclusive promo applies to both the &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-15026552" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;individual subscription&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-15026551" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;family plans&lt;/a&gt;. The discount — which is only available for a limited time — brings individual plans down from $2.99 to $1.50 a month for up to a year, which means you’re only paying $18 annually. Families of up to five individuals, on the other hand, will pay $30 a year instead of the typical $60, or $2.50 a month instead of $5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3YBvDb"&gt;Apple lovers, rejoice: we’ve got a second deal today you’ll love. For a limited time, you can score one of the best prices Amazon has ever offered on the 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Keyboard-Numeric-Wireless-Rechargable/dp/B071ZZTNBM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, which features a built-in numpad. Regularly $129, this wireless keyboard is on sale for $111 in silver (the latest, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Touch ID-equipped version&lt;/a&gt; retails for $179).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1a4VP"&gt;Outfitted with Apple’s scissor key switches, the keyboard works well with both the iPad and various Mac models. It also features a floating design and a Lightning port, allowing you to top off the rechargeable keyboard after about a month of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JYVg0G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ANoE9m"&gt;The newest Hisense 4K TVs are already relatively affordable, which is why their current discount, which runs up to $250, is such a great deal. Prices start at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Premium-75U6G-Quantum-Compatibility/dp/B091YM7DP5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$480 for the 50-inch model&lt;/a&gt;, with the larger 75-inch model going for $1,000 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Premium-75U6G-Quantum-Compatibility/dp/B091YK9W9S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (temporarily out of stock, but the deal is still available) and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHIS75U6G%2FHisense-75-Inch-U6G-Series-4K-ULED-Quantum-HDR-Smart-Android-TV-75U6G-2021%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F9%2F22662055%2Fapple-airtag-loop-hisense-4k-tv-asus-gaming-mouse-playstation-xbox-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,250. BuyDig’s deal is especially attractive, as the discount also comes with an extended four-year warranty. The cost is slightly higher from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxglaJ8lo5#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; at $1,150.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOPGYw"&gt;After in-depth testing, the &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/hisense/u6g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review site &lt;em&gt;Rtings.com&lt;/em&gt; concluded&lt;/a&gt; the 4K Android TV is packed with features that should please most people. &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; also praised the &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hisense-u6g-uled-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;excellent image quality&lt;/a&gt; and the fact it offers a wide selection of streaming apps thanks to its incorporation of Google Play. The TV also comes with support for Dolby Vision, HDR, HDR10+, and Google Assistant, as well as four HDMI ports and a voice-enabled remote. If you’re a gamer, however, you may want to look elsewhere, as the entry-level model doesn’t boast advanced gaming features such as HDMI 2.1. &lt;/p&gt;

Right now, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R14HS3R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus ROG Keris at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for an all-time low of $68, about $32 less than its typical $100 price tag. The sturdy, lightweight mouse boasts 78 hours of battery life and USB-C charging, and it can provide up to 12 hours of gameplay on a single, 15-minute charge. The peripheral also comes with replaceable side buttons, a 16,000 DPI sensor, and a 70-million-click life span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="OqWFMj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lC7Ffh"&gt;More of a PlayStation fan? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered! You can enjoy complimentary PlayStation games every month and exclusive sales on new releases with an annual subscription to PlayStation Plus, which is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=Verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states%2Fgamepilot" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available at Eneba&lt;/a&gt; for several dollars off with discount code &lt;strong&gt;HITMAN4PSPLUS&lt;/strong&gt;. Typically $60 a year, Eneba’s limited-time deal knocks the price down to $36, though, depending upon payment fees, the total could come out to be closer to $39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6oRl9"&gt;It’s a worthy investment for gamers given the savings the membership offers. PlayStation Plus comes with other perks, too, including access to online multiplayer and the PlayStation Plus Collection, which allows you to download &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, and a host of other classic PS4 games without any additional fees. &lt;/p&gt;
