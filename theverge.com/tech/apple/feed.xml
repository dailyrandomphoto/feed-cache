    <title>Apple’s new privacy ad imagines Thanos-snapping your stalkers out of existence</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRQCgvfwt6mkNNe6ISXkydwj5Ak=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319196/vlcsnap_2021_05_20_12h43m26s445.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xs6JLW"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; feature in iOS 14.5 doesn’t seem to be a difficult concept to grasp; initial estimates suggest &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/"&gt;as many as 96 percent of US users&lt;/a&gt; are leaping at the chance to tell their apps “No, you can’t track me across the internet.” Now, Apple is taking a victory lap with a full ad campaign, too, one that turns the feature into a selling point for the iPhone and furthers the attempt to pitch itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282158/apple-services-privacy-credit-card-tv-data-sharing"&gt;as the only tech company you can trust&lt;/a&gt;. And, if you ask me, its new ad spot “Tracked” is just about perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jjBXj"&gt;Just give it a watch, above: Who wouldn’t want to Thanos-snap ad trackers into dust? It’s no wonder Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;thinking long and hard about following Apple’s lead&lt;/a&gt; with an anti-tracking feature of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1qIbzV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to&amp;amp;nbsp;use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"},{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"},{"title":"Google is weighing an anti-tracking feature for Android, following Apple’s lead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"},{"title":"Can Apple live up to Apple’s privacy ads?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/22/21076245/apple-icloud-backup-encryption-loophole-privacy-ads-fbi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dmdztJ"&gt;Critics claim these moves &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;will make the internet more expensive&lt;/a&gt; and potentially harm small businesses, and are updating their apps to warn you about that — as well as the idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436944/twitter-ad-tracking-ios-14-5-app-transparency"&gt;that ads might be less relevant&lt;/a&gt; if you opt out. But that’s a tough sell compared to the privacy fears that exist these days, and it’s hard to argue with Apple’s idea that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;users should get to choose for themselves&lt;/a&gt;. The company also launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;privacy “nutrition labels”&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXl5OL"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that its own ad platform and apps don’t track users, and that the Ad Tracking Transparency prompt applies to its own apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MagSafe PopSockets are here: we tested to see if they stick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqlNFFCpe7-xJ9TASP5mQEOavfE=/13x0:4887x3249/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319172/DSCF2173.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PopGrip for MagSafe is bulkier than the regular PopGrips, but is easy to take off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pxHvXB"&gt;MagSafe PopSockets are finally here, after the famous phone handle company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225701/popsockets-magsafe-accessory"&gt;announced  they would be coming in January&lt;/a&gt;. The PopGrip for MagSafe sells for $30, which is two to three times more expensive than the adhesive versions, but the bigger question that people have been asking since the announcement is whether they’ll be as trustworthy. I decided it was time to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NcqiV"&gt;The PopGrip for MagSafe is a retractable grip for your phone (as the name implies) that can also work as a stand for watching video or a hands-free video call. PopSockets has made versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PopSockets-PopGrip-Swappable-Phones-Tablets/dp/B07P29XQR4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PopGrip&lt;/a&gt; for years now (and if you’ve got a collection of fun design tops, this will still work with those), but they’ve traditionally used an adhesive to attach to your device. The MagSafe version uses Apple’s system of magnets that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;it introduced on the iPhone 12 models&lt;/a&gt; and is compatible with everything from the iPhone 12 Mini to the gargantuan iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6swZQw"&gt;There have also been &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/METISINNO-MagSafe-Socket-Compatible-iPhone/dp/B08RDBZH6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some attempts by third parties&lt;/a&gt; to make MagSafe mounts that you can stick to your iPhone, then stick a PopSocket to, but the PopGrip for MagSafe is an integrated, first-party version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vb2ojW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1UrbXV"&gt;PopSockets makes it clear on the box that this shouldn’t be used with bare iPhones, and it’s easy to see why: the iPhone’s glass back doesn’t provide a lot of grip. But sometimes the question with accessories isn’t “what do the directions say” but “can I get away with using it like this?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/obBI70G9XJXgJXiM6dfR0iUhAXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528842/raw_phone_couch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goodbye!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hYY5rb"&gt;Looks like the answer is no! Listen to PopSockets, and do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use this thing with a bare phone. If you put it on and shake it around a few times you may get lucky and think that it’s fine, but I promise it will come off very easily at some point. Probably while you’re on some sort of perilous precipice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9NaThJHHHBX8_5IWRvlmlZTpFHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528854/DSCF2160.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: a terrible idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yks3rD"&gt;That did make me wonder, though, what would happen if I had a plastic case that wasn’t MagSafe compatible. Would the magnets still reach through, and would the plastic be less slippery than the iPhone’s glass? I can’t answer the second question, because the answer to the first one is absolutely not. It basically just falls off, even with a reasonably thin MagSafe-less case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ct2pov0pujZLr7ES3PnUTOHAiSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528889/Non_Magcase.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hGIc9Z"&gt;Okay, well let’s give the PopSocket the best-case scenario: how well will it stick to Apple’s silicone MagSafe case, which has both magnets and a reasonably grippy texture?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lgZc9xYyZ9T5MwzGn4UqB0oDUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528870/Silicone_Case_Couch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d call that a pass!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="47Zj35"&gt;As you can see, it’s not coming off — at least not until you want to pop it of to, say, wirelessly charge, in which case it’s actually very easy to remove. But maybe it’s just the specific way I was shaking it that let it perform so well. I will admit that I haven’t historically been a heavy PopSocket user, but I’ve been told that people put a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of faith in the PopSocket adhesive. So that made me wonder what was the silliest thing I could do to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; put the MagSafe case / PopGrip connection to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wW5Siz"&gt;And obviously the answer &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJchhTeDZhM"&gt;was karate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K33n3i4e3YpvbTKRvU-DWpYQZeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528824/karate_test.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike my form after years of not practicing, my phone is still intact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EhAYRD"&gt;Make no mistake, if you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to dislodge the PopSocket from the phone, you can. If I’m holding the phone at a perfect parallel angle to the floor and shaking with all my might, it will eventually come off, but that doesn’t seem like a terribly realistic scenario and it’s been rock-solid in all my other tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ut0Jkv"&gt;It’s also worth noting that I wasn’t able to test the MagSafe PopSocket with other case materials, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Leather-Case-MagSafe-iPhone/dp/B08L5NRTFJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s leather&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Clear-Case-iPhone-Pro/dp/B08L5NRTRR?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;clear plastic cases&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s hard to say if it would do as well. But it does seem that, with at least one of Apple’s cases, the MagSafe PopSocket can hang with the adhesive version. And if you use your phone with a non-MagSafe case, or no case at all? Well, you may have to stick with the sticky PopSockets, or buy a MagSafe case if you really want that sweet magnetic removability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BO7UM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants users to trust iOS, but it doesn’t trust iOS users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEGhukoMXQ3jbIcj5hR2SZQrAt8=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316368/1232992744.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="itNUqx"&gt;Apple’s software engineering head Craig Federighi had a tricky task in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;trial&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;explaining why the Mac’s security wasn’t good enough for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z65mDK"&gt;Mac computers have an official Apple App Store, but they also allow downloading software from the internet or a third-party store. Apple has never opened up iOS this way, but it’s long touted the privacy and security of both platforms. Then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;Epic Games sued Apple&lt;/a&gt; to force its hand, saying that if an open model is good enough for macOS, Apple’s claims about iOS ring hollow. On the stand yesterday, Federighi tried to resolve this problem by portraying iPhones and Macs as dramatically different devices — and in the process, threw macOS under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K95LbS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“iPhones are very attractive targets”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7hokj"&gt;Federighi outlined three main differences between iOS and macOS. The first is scale. Far more people use iPhones than Macs, and the more users a platform gets, the more enticing that audience becomes to malware developers. Federighi argued iOS users are also much more casual about downloading software, giving attackers better odds of luring them into a download. “iOS users are just accustomed to getting apps all the time,” he said, citing Apple’s old catchphrase: “There’s an app for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0TgRc"&gt;The second difference is data sensitivity. “iPhones are very attractive targets. They are very personal devices that are with you all the time. They have some of your most personal information — of course your contacts, your photos, but also other things,” he said. Mobile devices put a camera, microphone, and GPS tracker in your pocket. “All of these things make access or control of these devices potentially incredibly valuable to an attacker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnZXcz"&gt;That may undersell private interactions with Macs; Epic’s counsel Yonatan Even noted that many telemedicine calls and other virtual interactions happen on desktop. Still, it’s fair to say phones have become many people’s all-purpose digital lockboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaO4St"&gt;The third difference is more conceptual. Federighi basically says iOS users need to be more protected because the Mac is a specialist tool for people who know how to navigate the complexities of a powerful system, while the iPhone and iPad are — literally — for babies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Psg99x"&gt;As Federighi put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ttwNKA"&gt;The Mac from the beginning has been part of a generation of systems where the expectation is you can get software from wherever — you can hand it to your friend on a floppy disk and run it, that’s part of the expectation. But Mac users also expect a degree of flexibility that is useful to what they do. Some of them are software developers, some of them are pros running their unique tools, and having that power is part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUhnG6"&gt;I think of it is as if the Mac is a car — that you can take it off-road if you want, you can drive wherever you want. And that comes with as a driver, you gotta be trained, there’s a certain level of responsibility in doing that, but that’s what you wanted to buy. You wanted to buy a car. With iOS, we were able to create something where children — heck, even infants — can operate an iOS device, and be safe in doing so. So it’s a really different product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KuDAns"&gt;Federighi expanded on the metaphor a little later, when Apple’s counsel asked if macOS was “safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PwNnbL"&gt;Safe if operated correctly, much like that car. If you know how to operate a car, and you obey the rules of the road and are very cautious, yes. If you’re not — I’ve had a couple of family members who’ve gotten some malware on their Mac. But ultimately, I think the Mac can be operated safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="t6VTp5"&gt;I find the mental image of slowly, cautiously “driving” a Mac around the internet hilarious, because cars are deadly two-ton metal boxes that crush obstacles at superhuman speeds, while my MacBook starts losing keys if I type on it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHRkbD"&gt;If you pair these comments with some earlier statements about macOS, though, it’s a bit less funny. Federighi was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;bluntly critical&lt;/a&gt; of macOS security, saying Apple saw “a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable.” If you used the Mac’s security model on the iPhone, “with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac,” Federighi said. “iOS has established a dramatically higher bar for customer protection. The Mac is not meeting that bar today.” It’s a distinctly negative evaluation of open computing systems, implying only&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a relatively small platform could afford that openness without disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzU8Lt"&gt;Federighi took a far broader view of security than Epic’s own expert witness James Mickens. Mickens testified earlier that iOS wasn’t meaningfully more secure than Android, but he analyzed mostly technical threats to the platforms. Federighi focused on scams, phishing, and other apps that target human psychology instead of computer code — many of which pose serious dangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIJu8"&gt;Sometimes, though, the protectiveness felt patronizing. When Federighi explained Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming, he focused partly on tangible security issues, like how to grant device permissions for different titles on a single gaming app. But he slipped seamlessly into discussing how the concept would be simply too confusing — that iPhone and iPad owners would be befuddled by the notion of launching a separate game catalog. Apple wants iOS devices to feel trustworthy, but at times like that, it seems more like Apple just doesn’t trust its own users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zagg’s new iPad cases are affordable alternatives to the Magic Keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zs1gbbziPIX9enVihJVvr94SiW8=/125x0:875x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69315396/zagg_ipad_pro_keys_with_trackpad_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DmLdno"&gt;Zagg has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zagg.com%2Fen_us%2Fkeyboards%3Fcj_aid%3D12670080%26cj_pid%3D9173227%26cj_sid%3D%26cjdata%3DMXxOfDB8WXww%26cjevent%3De4ff189fb8f911eb80f200050a1c0e13&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F20%2F22444822%2Fzagg-pro-keys-trackpad-keyboard-case-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new selection of iPad keyboards&lt;/a&gt;: the Pro Keys with Trackpad, a case with a detachable Bluetooth keyboard; the laptop-style Rugged Book with an adjustable magnetic hinge; and the trackpad-less Pro Keys case (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/19/zagg-pro-keys-ipad-trackpad-case/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50rNSG"&gt;The accessories support several of Apple’s newest iPads, from the M1-enabled iPad Pro on the high-end to the entry level 10.2-inch iPad. Good alternative keyboard cases to Apple’s trackpad-equipped Magic Keyboard are mostly limited to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395219/logitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro"&gt;Logitech’s Combo Mix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287000/brydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch"&gt;Brydge’s Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;, so Zagg’s version is more than welcome, if a bit less sleek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6nqDP"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;the Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, the Pro Keys with Trackpad has a case that wraps around your entire iPad and a detachable backlit Bluetooth keyboard that also doubles as an adjustable stand when magnetically attached. Along with the trackpad, which can be independently turned off to save battery, the case also includes a built-in protective cover for the Apple Pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjpBf1"&gt;Based off Zagg’s photos, it seems pretty thick, but the keyboard case is almost half the price of the Magic Keyboard. The Pro Keys with Trackpad costs $149.99 for 11-inch iPad Pros and the 10.9-inch iPad Air. For the less powerful 10.2-inch iPad, it costs $139.99. There’s no version for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zagg’s Pro Keys with Trackpad case has a detachable keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="41bH6b"&gt;Zagg’s new Rugged Book is much closer to Brydge’s laptop-style keyboard cases. It’s thick, though in this case intentionally, and Zagg claims it has 6.6 feet of drop protection. The keyboard is still a backlit Bluetooth keyboard, but attaches via an adjustable magnetic hinge that should offer more viewing angles. It’s trackpad-free in this case, but the same price as the Pro Keys with Trackpad. The Rugged Book costs $149.99 and works with both the 11-inch iPad Pro and the 10.9-inch iPad Air. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hU0Rtj3oF1EOmZbAE1HUIwUIqP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22527012/01_hero_33_3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zagg’s Rugged Book has better drop protection, but lacks a trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2pNcc0"&gt;Finally, there’s the Pro Keys case, which is the most stripped down and straightforward of the bunch. Like its name suggests, it shares a lot of similarities in design to the Pro Keys with Trackpad, just without the trackpad. Like Apple’s Smart Keyboard Folio cases, the Pro Keys case offers two main viewing angles, but since it’s technically an iPad case and a keyboard cover, you can theoretically stay protected without the keyboard attached. The Pro Keys case costs $109.99 for the 11-inch iPad Pro models and 10.9-inch iPad Air. For the 2018 to 2021 12.9-inch iPad, the Pro Keys case costs $169.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zagg’s Pro Keys lacks a trackpad, but is also less expensive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Apple announces a slew of accessibility updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person’s wrist showing an Apple Watch. On the screen of the Watch is an option to end a run, highlighted with a small cursor hovering over it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SWKaurK8b9bqtr9jfqXcQwibWgI=/100x0:880x520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312971/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_2.42.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch with the Assistive Touch cursor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R3hyNc"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444137%2Fapple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a variety of new and updated features for people with disabilities today. Beginning May 20th, customers can use the new SignTime sign language interpreter service to contact AppleCare and retail customer care through their web browsers. Software updates later this year to iOS, watchOS, and iPadOS will bring improved options for Assistive Touch, VoiceOver, hearing aid support, and background sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="inBvEa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We believe everyone should have the tools they need to change the world. Accessibility is a fundamental right, and we’re always pushing the boundaries of innovation so that everyone can learn, create and connect in new ways. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GAAD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GAAD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oZwQNG7p5x"&gt;https://t.co/oZwQNG7p5x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1395074896791674885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OzzyD6"&gt;The new SignTime service is launching first in the US, UK, and France, and offers remote interpreter access for American Sign Language, British Sign Language, and French Sign Language. People can also use the service in Apple stores to get interpretation without booking it in advance, potentially preventing the hassle of wrangling an interpreter on short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GElgH8"&gt;People with limb differences will be able to use Assistive Touch on watchOS, which should enable them to use Apple Watch without touching the screen. (Apple did not verify which Watches this will work for.) Apple says the Apple Watch can detect muscle movement and tendon activity through its built-in sensors, allowing users to control a cursor on the watch screen, answer calls, access notifications, and more by making various movements and gestures. (You can see it in action in the video &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444137%2Fapple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on this page&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gg8fFG"&gt;iPadOS will support third-party eye-tracking devices, allowing people with low mobility to move a cursor with their gaze and perform actions by holding eye contact, rather than tapping the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGGMmo"&gt;VoiceOver, Apple’s built-in screen reader, will be updated to include more details in images. According to Apple, it will allow people to navigate images with text and data tables by rows and columns, and describe people and objects in images. People will also be able to add image descriptions with Markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OSdE9"&gt;Apple plans to upgrade the Made for iPhone hearing devices program, too, with support for bidirectional hearing aids. Users will also be able to upload their hearing test results to Headphone Accommodations to more easily customize how the feature amplifies sounds and adjusts different frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three smiling Memojis, showing one with a cochlear implant on the left, one with nasal oxygen tubes in the center, and one with a soft helmet on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xafYxYSX8o60kVdNupxHnTZbpls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526096/apple_gaad21_new_memoji_05192021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/e1e4026d-01e3-40da-bea5-aee0f1e19a09" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UCeQKs"&gt;For neurodiverse people (or anyone who likes white noise), Apple is introducing Background Sounds that can be incorporated with other audio and system sounds. They include “balanced, bright, or dark noise, as well as ocean, rain, or stream sounds” that can be set to play continuously and mask distracting or overwhelming noises.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emW7wY"&gt;Other features Apple is planning for later in the year include the ability to use mouth sounds like clicks or pops instead of using physical buttons, the customization of display and text size settings in individual apps, and new Memoji options with cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, and soft helmets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNKugC"&gt;Companies large and small always have room for improvement when it comes to making their products accessible, but Apple has generally been a leader in the space. These updates hopefully signal a continued commitment to designing with disabled people in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDofnN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qKNPY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The level of Mac malware is not acceptable, says Apple’s Craig Federighi at Epic trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKC7LIxZ9HPRsGn7Ta9ZY_QK5yY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312798/967357020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjuVel"&gt;The antitrust case between Apple and Epic continued today, and it brought Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, to the stand. Federighi’s mission was pretty clear from the outset: to extol the security benefits that come with iOS’s walled-off ecosystem and warn of the dangers that would come with breaking the App Store model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTIwUX"&gt;But in building that argument, Federighi also made some surprisingly blunt concessions about security on macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fGp6j"&gt;“If you took Mac security techniques and applied them to the iOS ecosystem, with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac,” Federighi said in the testimony. “And as I say, today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable and is much worse than iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XqAfB"&gt;Federighi made the claim as part of a broader argument for why iOS could not adopt the same software model as macOS, which allows for alternate software sources like the Epic Games Store. But in making the case for iOS security, the software chief ended up painting a bleak picture of security on the desktop platform. The full exchange is presented in context below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0ncbts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Rogers:&lt;/strong&gt; There are multiple stores on the Mac. So, if that can happen on the Mac, why should we not allow the same stores to exist on the phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gO2e1B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craig Federighi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it’s certainly how we’ve done it on the Mac and it’s regularly exploited on the Mac. iOS has established a dramatically higher bar for customer protection. The Mac is not meeting that bar today. And that’s despite the fact that Mac users inherently download less software and are subject to a way less economically motivated attacker base. If you took Mac security techniques and applied them to the iOS ecosystem, with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac. And as I say, today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable and is much worse than iOS. Put that same situation in place for iOS and it would be a very bad situation for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="g1xvsS"&gt;Federighi also cast the difference between the two platforms in unusual terms, describing the desktop platform as something akin to a car. “If operated correctly, much like that car, if you know how to operate a car and obey the rules of the road and are very cautious, yes,” he said when asked directly whether macOS is safe. “If not, I’ve had a couple of family members who have gotten some malware on their Macs.” macOS allows software to be downloaded and installed from the web, but &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-your-mac-from-malware-mh40596/mac"&gt;Apple advises customers&lt;/a&gt; that restricting this functionality to the App Store is “the most secure setting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiPm6h"&gt;In contrast, Federighi presented iOS as a child-safe version of the less restricted macOS. “With iOS, we were able to create something where children — heck, even infants — are able to operate an iOS device and be safe in doing so. It’s really a different product,” Federighi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BriuCU"&gt;Federighi’s testimony comes in the final days of the trial, with much of the remaining time devoted to testimony from Apple executives. CEO Tim Cook is expected to take the stand on Friday, with closing statements from both sides given on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple asks court to rule iOS is not an ‘essential facility’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lj2NFTGo5oCxlnN603zOw__94tU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310699/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cfvrvd"&gt;After two and a half weeks in court, Apple is taking aim at one of the central elements of Epic’s antitrust case. &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20761616-apple-motion-to-dismiss-essential-facility-claim"&gt;In a filing Tuesday night&lt;/a&gt;, Apple asked the court to dismiss one of the 10 counts alleged in the initial complaint, arguing Epic had failed to establish any evidence for the charge that Apple had violated the essential facilities doctrine by failing to provide access to software distribution tools on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cptEsS"&gt;“At trial, Epic adduced no proof in support of this claim,” Apple’s filing reads. “On the contrary, Epic’s principal expert expressly disclaimed any opinion on essential facility, and (in response to a direct question from the Court) rejected the notion that iOS should be treated as a public utility. The Court should enter judgment for Apple on this claim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ccReMg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It sounds to me like what Epic is saying is ‘We want Apple to allow us to deal on their platform,’” says the judge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A1oReY"&gt;Filed as a motion for partial findings, Apple is pushing to split off the essential facilities charge from the other nine charges made in Epic’s initial complaint. In essence, Apple believes it can win a quick victory on this specific point. That won’t settle the case entirely since the other nine charges still require a ruling, but it would be an unexpected and embarrassing loss for Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6KoVn"&gt;Epic hasn’t talked about the essential facilities doctrine much in court, and Apple’s lawyers are responding in part to vocal skepticism from the court. On May 12th, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers specifically confronted Epic about the weakness of its evidence for the charge. “I’ve heard quite a bit of evidence throughout the trial regarding how big Apple is and how anticompetitive it is,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1392558985643970564"&gt;Gonzalez Rogers said&lt;/a&gt;. “It sounds to me like what Epic is saying is ‘We want Apple to allow us to deal on their platform. And there are only two of these platforms, and because there are only two platforms, all these competitors can’t succeed without access to these platforms.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYdqrB"&gt;Epic’s counsel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1392558958972391424"&gt;clarified that&lt;/a&gt; it had “not abandoned that theory” — but it hasn’t substantially raised it in the days since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8WYHR1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple controls iOS, which is essential to effective competition in the iOS App Distribution Market,” argues Epic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w7qpA0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_facilities_doctrine"&gt;The essential facilities doctrine&lt;/a&gt; is a long-standing element of antitrust law that prevents dominant firms from using bottleneck services to box out competitors. &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/224/383/"&gt;In a foundational example from 1912&lt;/a&gt;, a railroad consortium prevented competitors from offering passage to and from St. Louis by denying access to switching yards around the city. The Supreme Court ruled that the arrangement was an illegal restraint of trade, establishing that companies must provide reasonable use of facilities that are essential for competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNnUoX"&gt;In its complaint, Epic argues that app distribution on iOS is the same kind of bottleneck, charging that Apple has used its control over the iOS platform to prevent Epic and other competitors from offering competing app stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoQU0Z"&gt;“Apple controls iOS, which is essential to effective competition in the iOS App Distribution Market,” the complaint argues. “Through its denial of its essential facility, Apple maintains its monopoly power in the iOS App Distribution Market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKEwJA"&gt;But Apple is now countering that Epic has reasonable access to iOS through the App Store itself — and that iOS customers are plainly not essential to the operation of its business since the company has been broadly successful without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QIGvj"&gt;“Epic’s own experience, as established by the trial evidence, confirms that there is nothing ‘essential’ about iOS,” Apple’s filing reads. “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was a success before it was made available on the App Store, and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s revenues from iOS (prior to its removal) accounted for just 7 percent of its total revenue. And native apps are not the only way Epic can reach iOS customers—it also is free to distribute its products (including by selling V-Bucks) to iOS customers over the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbx0cb"&gt;Apple’s motion asks for a hearing on the issue on Monday, May 24th — or “as soon thereafter as the matter may be heard by the Court.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPad Pro (2021) review: dream screen </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Mini LED, major improvement&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TZBslC"&gt;How much do you care about having a great screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPrMnJ"&gt;That, really, is the only question that matters with the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro. It has a new kind of display so good I think it is the best thing for watching movies that isn’t a high-end television. It starts at $1,099 for a 128GB version, but increased storage and accessories like a keyboard or the Apple Pencil can shoot the price up fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsmZOW"&gt;Both the 12.9 and the smaller 11-inch iPad Pro (which starts at $799) feature Apple’s M1 processor and some other updated specs, all of which are excellent. But even that fancy processor — the same as you’ll find in the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; — doesn’t fundamentally change the story of what the iPad Pro is and what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOJ3Hc"&gt;It is an iPad, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVndsY"&gt;But the 12.9-inch version of the iPad Pro is an iPad with a very beautiful display. And so again, the question is what that screen means to the experience of using an iPad, especially since the price has jumped $100 compared to the last model. How much do you care about having a great screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="RUGlvz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10507195"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="GlN0SG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10507198"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bxLxtR"&gt;Here is a very brief, wildly incomplete, and necessarily oversimplified education on flat panel screen technology. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Chris Welch has a longer one&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glK9JS"&gt;There are two basic types you usually see, LCD and OLED. Both have pixels that combine red, green, and blue subpixels to create colors, but in order for you to actually see those colors the display pixels need to be lit up. OLED pixels are self-lit; LCD panels light up the display pixels by putting one, several, or many LED backlights behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOzHr1"&gt;The benefit of LCD panels with LED backlighting is that they’re relatively inexpensive, long-lasting, bright, and unlikely to burn in. The benefit of OLED is that the black pixels are not lit at all, meaning you get superb contrast, but they are relatively expensive and don’t get as bright. Each technology’s strength is the other’s weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTEgYk"&gt;Mini LED, the technology powering the 12.9-inch iPad Pro display, is designed to bring the LCD panel as close as possible to OLED’s contrast and black levels. Its display pixels are not self-lit, but instead lit from behind. The trick is that they’re lit by 10,000 tiny LED lights split up by software into 2,500 local dimming zones. It’s almost like the backlight itself is a lower-resolution screen behind the screen, tracking the image and making sure the black parts of the picture aren’t lit up.  &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iPad Pro models have the same shape, and though the 12.9 model is slightly thicker, it still worked with an old Magic Keyboard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Both new iPad Pros. The 11-inch lacks Mini LED, but it still has a great screen with ProMotion." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TD9l8Cm0L-hGMBoQJVkkJbTLogY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524104/vpavic_210516_4592_0267.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Both new iPad Pros. The 11-inch lacks Mini LED, but it still has a great screen with ProMotion.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OpKAFs"&gt;I would never call the display on the 11-inch iPad Pro bad, because it’s a stellar display. But because it uses a more traditional LCD backlight system with fewer dimming zones, you can see that the blacks are actually just a little gray. On the 12.9-inch version, Mini LED lets blacks be truly black, offers a high contrast ratio, and can also get very bright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3NWvg"&gt;Apple is calling this screen the “Liquid Retina XDR display.” And it has all the benefits of Apple’s previous iPad Pro displays: it’s very high resolution, color-accurate, and it has fairly good viewing angles. It supports ProMotion, Apple’s term for a variable refresh rate to increase smoothness and match the frame rate of videos. (“Liquid Retina,” as far as Apple has ever told us, refers to the Apple-specific method of making round corners on an LCD.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvyitW"&gt;The funny thing about the 12.9-inch iPad is that it is very easy to miss the benefits of Mini LED in normal day-to-day use. At first you don’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTXo1z"&gt;Sure, there’s great contrast when you’re browsing the web, texting, playing games, and so on, but really it’s not very different from any other iPad. Apple still limits the max brightness in most scenarios to 600 nits, which is bright enough but not eye-popping (the iPad and iPad Air max out at 500 nits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1OD89Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iMac brings M1 goodness to the desktop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hdr4QH"&gt;The magic kicks in when you are viewing videos or photos in full-screen. When you do that, the iPad Pro kicks into a different HDR mode (or in Apple’s parlance, XDR, for “Extreme Dynamic Range”) that really is stunning. The overall max brightness of the screen jumps up to a powerful 1,000 nits and peak brightness for certain lighting can hit 1,600 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWAArh"&gt;You don’t see it until you see it — but then you &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iPad Pro with the Liquid Retina XDR display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JdPAM8"&gt;The joke I’ve been telling people is that the display is so good that &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; actually makes sense when you watch it on this iPad Pro. HDR content is incredible on this screen. I am not a display quality enthusiast, but this screen is functionally equivalent to a high-end OLED TV to my eyes, especially in a dark room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgFjb7"&gt;If you are also not a display quality enthusiast, you might be left unimpressed with descriptions of nits and contrast ratios. I get it, but there are intangibles to the screen that I struggle to describe and have struggled even harder to capture in photos and video. For example, some colors just look better and more accurate to me, especially textured yellows. It just does a better job showing fine detail in situations where dark and light elements get mixed together, like with hair or a building reflecting sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Both Kindle and Apple Books in dark mode, in a very dark room, have a weird gray halo around text not due to normal blooming (Click to enlarge.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Both Kindle and Apple Books in dark mode, in a very dark room, have a weird gray halo around text not due to normal blooming (Photo edited to best replicate what I saw with my eyes)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="svXalO"&gt;The display isn’t perfect, of course. If you run a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYtvehF9-Z8"&gt;local dimming test&lt;/a&gt; you will see blooming on brightly lit pixels against a black background. I only noticed this when running tests that are specifically designed to surface blooming, though. In regular use, everything looked great, sharp, and evenly lit across the entire screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeeXCq"&gt;There was one odd bug I experienced. Putting either the Kindle app or Apple Books into dark mode and viewing them in a near-pitch black room, I noticed a strange gray haze around all of the text blocks. It’s too big to be blooming; it’s more like the local dimming algorithms got a little confused. It’s a minor thing that I hope gets fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLJ1Re"&gt;For me, the quality of the display when watching video on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is impressive, but it’s also not at the top of my list of priorities when picking a computer. I care a little more about portability, weight, and — yes — functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsPVW"&gt;So let’s talk about that M1 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPad Pro is great for video editing" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lF20kEwDsHsYdlIqMirweSX1rmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524091/vpavic_210512_4592_0110.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iPad Pro is great for video editing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9s9wDu"&gt;What does it really mean that the iPad Pro now has the same chip that powers Apple’s latest Mac computers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPHtDd"&gt;It does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean that iPads will be able to run Mac apps now. While Apple is happy to let the Mac run iPad apps and generally let you do whatever you want on it (except touch the screen), the iPad Pro continues to be a more, shall we say, curated experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzhiBg"&gt;One interesting consequence of the M1 is that for the first time in the history of iOS devices, Apple is publicly disclosing how much RAM these devices have. It’s 8GB on models with 512GB or fewer of storage and 16GB on models with 1TB or more. Whether or not that’s actionable information is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znAEml"&gt;The M1 is obviously fast, and in benchmarks it’s faster than the last A12Z Bionic that Apple put in the previous iPad Pro models. But in my usage, I didn’t actually perceive any speed improvements in any of the apps that I use — because everything was already very fast on the iPad Pro. I got the exact same export speeds in Premiere Rush on the brand new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the M1 as on my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;2018 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The 2021 11-inch iPad Pro. This review has focused a lot on the 12.9, but other than the screen and size the 11-inch is the same. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4eZjQC"&gt;Both the RAM and the M1 processor are specs that won’t make an appreciable difference to the vast majority of iPad users. They’re specs that will matter to certain “pro” users who have found specific apps and workflows that push the limit of what an iPad can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uzcos1"&gt;Apple touts soon-to-be released capabilities in apps like &lt;a href="https://luma-touch.com/lumafusion-for-ios-2/"&gt;LumaFusion&lt;/a&gt; and AR effects, and I have no doubt that there are benefits for power users of those apps. For the rest of us, the reasons to get an iPad Pro are less about speeds and feeds and more about the overall experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqGSWd"&gt;Another consequence of the M1 is that the USB-C port now supports Thunderbolt accessories. In theory, that’s great. I plugged my iPad into my very fancy CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt dock and was gratified to see my monitor light up right away. From there, though, I ran into the same old iPad problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3C3LZ7"&gt;I have a USB microphone interface hooked into the dock, and for whatever reason I was unable to get any audio out of it on the iPad, just silence. I also tested out some admittedly old LaCie Thunderbolt 2 drives with an adapter and couldn’t get them to show up in the Files app. Oh and just to remind you: the monitor still can only mirror the iPad Pro — it can’t serve as a second display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgXxNV"&gt;Similarly, the dock has an audio-out so it shows up as a speaker. On the Mac, I can easily change settings to let my computer know to play audio out of its own speakers since I don’t have anything hooked up to the dock for sound. Nothing doing on the iPad Pro — if there’s a setting that would let me move the audio back to the iPad’s own excellent speakers, I couldn’t find it. (Long pressing on the AirPlay icon in Control Center only listed the dock as an option.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIqTMo"&gt;Seemingly every new iPad Pro inspires an admittedly exhausting but also necessary discussion about whether or not iPadOS is actually capable enough to justify the price of the hardware that runs it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmRBkP"&gt;The M1 processor sharpens that discussion. To me, the biggest difference between the Mac and the iPad at this point isn’t the touchscreen, it’s Apple’s approach to the operating system. On the iPad, Apple would rather not offer a feature than have it work in a non-iPad way. That’s noble, but it means the company has committed itself to reinventing a lot of wheels in computing: files, peripheral support, multi-window interfaces, and all the rest have to be re-thought and re-done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIP8dU"&gt;Sometimes that reinvention results in some genuinely great features. The iPad’s “windowing” system takes some getting used to and has its limitations, but it can be a joy to use and makes organizing your digital stuff a bit easier. The problem is that all that reinvention is taking a very long time — it’s been six years since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9288241/apple-ipad-pro-announced-specs-price-release-date"&gt;original iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Center Stage works very well to keep you in frame. And as a bonus, the camera doesn’t blank out when you multitask in Zoom calls anymore.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AQ163j"&gt;One new invention I love is the Center Stage feature. It zooms and follows human faces to keep them centered in the frame of the iPad’s wide-angle front facing camera. It works in any video conferencing app without the need for setup and it performs very well, better than similar features on smart displays like the Echo Show or Facebook Portal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRhVtw"&gt;I’d love it even more if the front-facing cameras on the iPad Pro weren’t &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; in the wrong spot when attached to a keyboard — off to the side instead of centered on top. It’s great that the camera can keep my face centered in frame, it’s not so great that I am literally giving my coworkers the side-eye because I’m looking off to the right of where the cameras are to see their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xz45W"&gt;One more note: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399095/apple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-2020-models-magic-keyboard-incompatible"&gt;Apple has said&lt;/a&gt; that the original 12.9-inch Magic Keyboard “may not precisely fit when closed” as the new iPad Pro is slightly thicker. But when I tested it, I couldn’t discern any difference between the fit on the original and the new, white Magic Keyboard. Both worked — and closed — fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssOGZn"&gt;In any case, set aside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186312/ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-future-computers"&gt;“What’s a computer” argument&lt;/a&gt; and let’s be more pragmatic. A 256GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard costs $1,548. A 256GB MacBook Air with the same processor costs $999. And just to be realistic: most people can get more done on the Mac than on the iPad. Taken strictly as a work machine, the Mac wins out on both price and functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgIJTi"&gt;That includes battery life, by the way. Both iPad Pros have good battery life, but it’s not significantly improved over previous iPads. And as many people have discovered during the pandemic, if you actually use the iPad for work all day (especially if you do a lot of Zoom calls), the iPad Pro can conk out in eight hours or less. The MacBook Air edges it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoOX4n"&gt;Last and certainly not least, Apple’s refusal to offer multi-user support on the iPad has gone from being mystifying to obstinate. The company clearly intends this to be a single-user device, despite the fact that it would theoretically make for an even more compelling family computer than the pastel-colored iMacs that share the same processor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="l4a7Tt"&gt;But to give Apple the benefit of the doubt here, if you’re looking strictly at the iPad Pro as a work machine, you’re probably missing the point. The iPad Pro is simply a more beautiful, more premium object than even Apple’s own laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hESvSF"&gt;It’s easy to take for granted, but the hardware in this tablet really is amazing: Face ID, dual rear cameras that are quite good and paired with LiDAR, quad speakers with superb sound and decent volume, excellent microphones, support for the Apple Pencil, the best screen you can get on a portable device, and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A1C1Ni"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The justification for getting an iPad Pro isn’t its feature set, it’s the experience of using a well-made, high-end object&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bECkFJ"&gt;The reason to get the iPad Pro 12.9 (or even the 11) is simply to get the best, nicest iPad. Unless you can specifically answer right now which app in your workflow is slowed down by the specs on a lesser iPad, the $599 iPad Air or even the $329 base iPad offer the same core features that most people really use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3C51wb"&gt;Except for a slim minority of people, the justification for getting an iPad Pro isn’t its feature set, it’s the experience of using a well-made, high-end object. Until I hit the limits of iPadOS (which I hit regularly), I enjoy using an iPad Pro more than I do any other computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaAv9f"&gt;The wonderful Mini LED display on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro doesn’t change any of those equations, it just makes the nicest iPad Pro even nicer. And so my yearly refrain about the iPad Pro remains. If you want the very best iPad, this is the very best iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SrTvAP"&gt;Just remember, it’s an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ohf59d"&gt;Phil Schiller is one of the biggest names at Apple, and at the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, his job was to make Apple feel small. Over two days of testimony including several hours of cross-examination, he didn’t always succeed — but he left the stand without facing some of Epic’s harshest lines of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0iCoi"&gt;Schiller, whose title is simply “Apple Fellow,” has spent more than 30 years with the company. In his testimony, he recounted joining Apple in the ‘90s and watching Steve Jobs reorganize the then-failing computer maker. He reminisced about the iPod and name-dropped largely forgotten competitors like Handango and BlackBerry Messenger. In court, Epic Games has portrayed Apple as a scolding, disingenuous bully that locks users into a walled garden and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429267/epic-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-trial-peely-day-6"&gt;gets mad at cartoon bananas&lt;/a&gt;. Schiller countered with an iOS product showcase and Apple history lesson, and Epic didn’t do much to stop him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zsPov4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Schiller countered Epic with an Apple history lesson&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L4INfY"&gt;The iPod bit was a great encapsulation of Schiller’s time on the stand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;As my colleague Liz Lopatto notes&lt;/a&gt;, Schiller famously served as Apple’s longtime marketing head. But at the prompting of an Apple lawyer, Schiller mentioned on Tuesday that he’d also helped invent the iPod clickwheel — one of Apple’s most distinctive hardware designs. And why, Apple’s counsel asked, was a marketing executive working on hardware design? “Product marketing works hand-in-hand with engineering on all of our projects,” Schiller explained. Different parts of Apple simply aren’t siloed into neat divisions; it’s one tight-knit company that makes a many-featured product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or3Ysc"&gt;That anecdote buttressed a more legally pertinent claim: because of this management system, Apple allegedly has no idea how much the App Store makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbpYiD"&gt;One Epic-paid expert witness has pegged Apple’s operating margins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;between 70 and 80 percent&lt;/a&gt;, something Epic calls evidence of monopoly power. Epic used one of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2017%2F06%2Fdeveloper-earnings-from-the-app-store-top-70-billion%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F18%2F22442395%2Fat-the-epic-trial-phil-schiller-got-away-clean" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s PR statistics&lt;/a&gt; to estimate the App Store made $20 billion or more in commissions by 2017. Schiller didn’t dispute the number. But he said Apple never calculated its overall profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iSlQkC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Product marketing works hand-in-hand with engineering on all of our projects”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vcyx62"&gt;“We don’t deny that it likely is. It’s just that we haven’t managed the business that way,” Schiller said of the App Store. He rattled off iPhone features that require lots of work and benefit App Store developers, but don’t involve spending money on the store itself. Epic attorney Katherine Forrest was incredulous: “Apple can do accelerometers, and machine learning, and have some of the most sophisticated technology around, and it can’t figure out if the App Store is profitable — is that what you’re saying?” Schiller, however, never changed his story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QtsNu"&gt;Apple used Schiller to put a new spin on Epic’s other evidence against it. Epic has cited a 2008 message where he said opening up iOS would mean “throwing out the whole plan” for the operating system. But where Epic described that plan as a single monopolistic gambit, Schiller says he was just describing the straightforward goal of a central App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bkt8Dr"&gt;“You keep going back to that sentence referring to ‘the plan,’ as if there was one special plan that we referred to,” he complained at one point. Where Epic has pointed out phrases like “lock-in” and seeking “stickiness” on iOS, Schiller emphasized that the “stickiness” involved trying to add features that would discourage phishing. “If there’s any plan here, it’s simply to come up with new features to help protect users from security and privacy scams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n72rMO"&gt;Some choices are tougher to spin as fair-minded altruism. One court filing suggests Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;kept iMessage off Android&lt;/a&gt; to discourage switching ecosystems, and another recounts a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;list of sweetener deals&lt;/a&gt; that Apple discussed offering Netflix, despite claims to not favor individual developers. iMessage and the App Store play a huge role in consumer technology, and Epic’s counsel had a chance to push Schiller on them, helping the rest of us better understand how Apple makes these calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjggQl"&gt;But mostly, Epic... just didn’t. Cross-examination touched on topics like iMessage, but Epic’s counsel favored exhaustive readings of policies and lists that could show Apple in an unfavorable light, including every time it mentions relying on open source software and the search results for “BDSM” on the App Store. Little of this related to Schiller himself, although we did glean details like his favorite &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins (&lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Rogue_Agent"&gt;Rogue Agent&lt;/a&gt; and the New England Patriots), his use of Reddit (“I tried it once”), and whether knows what Pornhub is (allegedly, no.) And while Schiller occasionally sounded frustrated, he stuck to his central claims: the App Store can’t be carved out or measured, and even if it’s made Apple rich, it’s helped everyone else as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>

      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air has the same design and shape as the 11-inch iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There is also a sale on the 256GB, which is available for $490 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NHN9W4J?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQeiGK"&gt;Walmart, however, offers an even steeper discount; the 64GB iPad mini is currently available for $369 in either &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeiPadDeals032921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F816033343%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeiPadDeals032921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now at $540, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has been discounted in every color minus space gray at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $670, which is nearly $80 off its usual price of $749. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Green%2F705887437%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeiPadDeals032921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is also having a sale&lt;/a&gt; on the iPad Air 256GB, offering it for as low as $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-gen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394227/apple-ipad-pro-2021-how-where-to-buy-preorder-link"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt;, which means there are plenty of deals to be had on the now-discontinued 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro. The fourth-gen iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch, fourth-gen model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
