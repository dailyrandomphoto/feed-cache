    <title>Apple’s Series 6 Watch is down to $320 at Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OYnGU6"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can save $80 on the Apple Watch Series 6. Normally $400, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 40mm model with GPS for only $320 if you buy the wearable in red&lt;/a&gt;. The sale price on the product listing notes $385, but the retailer will knock an additional $65 off that price at checkout to bring it down to $320. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yssRql"&gt;The Series 6 is currently the flagship watch by Apple and features an always-on display in addition to new sensors that allow users to keep tabs on their blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dyKFO4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IV8gv8"&gt;If you are looking to buy Apple’s most affordable iPad, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737008739520232562#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has a deal on the 128GB storage model, which you can buy for only $380&lt;/a&gt; — $50 off its usual retail price of $430. This iPad model includes a 10.2-inch display, an A12 Bionic processor, a Smart Connector to connect to a Smart Keyboard, and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3b6LRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431710"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5fNuD9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers &lt;/em&gt;is a sequel to the critically acclaimed JRPG game &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with gameplay similar to the &lt;em&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/em&gt; franchise. If you are looking to buy the game on either &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737009243776759335#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737010170367657302#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt;, Best Buy has knocked $20 off its usual retail price, bringing it down to its lowest price yet of $40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdU617"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yy8cIC"&gt;PlayStation Plus is an online subscription service that allows both PS4 and PS5 owners to play games (that are not normally free to play) online. But the service also includes some other incentives, including regular discounts on the PlayStation Store, access to free games each month, and, if you have a PS5, access to the PlayStation Plus Collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhnEpJ"&gt;If you are looking to renew your membership, Eneba is offering a deal to readers of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; based in the US. From now until April 11th, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals04062021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership for $27&lt;/a&gt; when you enter code &lt;strong&gt;APRILVERGE &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The long overdue Apple TV refresh may offer 120Hz support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/77g2c5m5yj_buMEQU2PmaZt4R9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69081252/akrales_170919_1976_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vSzAlX"&gt;The Apple TV 4K hasn’t been updated for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;more than three and a half years&lt;/a&gt;, which is an eternity in technology. But &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/05/tvos-14-5-beta-code-suggests-120hz-support-coming-to-a-new-apple-tv-model/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the new tvOS 14.5 beta references support for 120Hz refresh rates — a capability that no currently available Apple TV models have — which could indicate Apple is working on a new version of its set-top box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFM1DX"&gt;While it’s not clear what Apple may use a 120Hz refresh rate for in a new Apple TV, one of the more intriguing possibilities is for smoother gaming, like what’s offered with 120Hz support on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Apple has been showing increased interest in gaming as of late, so it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if the new Apple TV had more gaming-focused features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni0cS9"&gt;For example, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad"&gt;just added&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of new games to its Apple Arcade gaming subscription service, which lets you play games on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV and carry your progress across platforms. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;the iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/macos-big-sur-113-adds-fixes-for-ios-apps-on-desktop-support-for-ps5-and-xsx-pads"&gt;macOS 11.3&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1612241720"&gt;tvOS 14.5 betas&lt;/a&gt; also all include support for the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller and the Xbox Series X controller — presumably, that support will carry over to the final software releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3a7Zc"&gt;The rumored 120Hz support for Apple TV would also line up with a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from December&lt;/a&gt;, which said Apple was working on a new Apple TV for sometime this year with a “stronger gaming focus.” (That report also said the new set-top box would have a redesigned remote, which will hopefully be easier to use.) While we don’t know exactly when Apple will announce this rumored device, or if it will announce it at all, if you’re in the market for a new Apple TV, you might want to wait just a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook says Apple wants to use AR to make conversations better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XyXtioEn6PU0aevifVg7fblDyMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076836/dbohn_170912_1993_2091.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wsz98c"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook rarely provides details on unannounced products, but he offered some hints about Apple’s thinking on augmented reality and cars in an interview &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/is-apples-privacy-push-facebooks-existential-threat.html?"&gt;with Kara Swisher for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;this morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtLk2O"&gt;When it comes to augmented reality, he agreed with Swisher’s framing that the tech is “critically important” to Apple’s future and said it could be used to enhance conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aob5ZT"&gt;“You and I are having a great conversation right now. Arguably, it could even be better if we were able to augment our discussion with charts or other things to appear,” Cook said. He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0sM9yy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jVcUXn"&gt;Apple has been rumored for years to be working on an augmented reality headset, and the latest leaks suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;a mixed reality device&lt;/a&gt; could launch next year. Augmented reality features are already available on the iPhone and iPad, but outside of some fun Snapchat filters, augmented reality hasn’t become all that widely used yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlxGHp"&gt;Cook also talked broadly about Apple’s approach to products during a question about cars. Leaks from Apple have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194032/apple-car-self-driving-battery-tech"&gt;made it unclear&lt;/a&gt; if the company is developing self-driving tech that it could license to other companies or if Apple plans to develop an entire car by itself. Cook’s latest comments suggest the latter, assuming the project comes to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4ruuF"&gt;“We love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs,” Cook said. “And so that’s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that’s around that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmCy6m"&gt;Cook referred to “autonomy” as a “core technology” and said there are “lots of things you can do” with it in connection with robots. But he warned that not every Apple project eventually ships. “We investigate so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day,” Cook said. “I’m not saying that one will not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtEzfH"&gt;Swisher also asked Cook about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;Elon Musk’s comments&lt;/a&gt; about a failed attempt to discuss selling Tesla to Apple around 2017. “You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon,” Cook said, “although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change Siri’s voice in the iOS 14.5 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFsYk_I7SRkTLJ2YqLOOcBYLeUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067730/akrales_190522_3444_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvbuiG"&gt;Until recently, the default voice for Apple’s Siri assistant has been stereotypically female-sounding. However, studies have found that having AI assistants default to female-sounding voices can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634322/amazon-alexa-apple-siri-female-voice-assistants-harmful-gender-stereotypes-new-study"&gt;reinforce harmful stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple has tried to fix that in its upcoming iOS 14.5, which is now in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KGYdg"&gt;When you update your phone to iOS 14.5, you’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;prompted to pick a default voice for Siri&lt;/a&gt; — and Apple is including two new voice options. However, if you’ve changed your mind and want to use a different voice (or are using the 14.5 beta and weren’t prompted), this guide will show you how to change the voice after setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhB1LI"&gt;It’s a reasonably simple process. First, go to the Settings app, then to Siri &amp;amp; Search, and tap Siri Voice. There, you’ll be presented with the list of options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/583JirAdCoNcghR8xipu6St_0-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416486/Image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap Siri Voice to be taken to the list of options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mph8AS"&gt;At the moment, the American variety is the only one with four voice choices; Australian, British, Indian, Irish, and South African versions only have two. The four US voice choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yS4oPO"&gt;Voice 1, which is a soft-spoken male-sounding voice &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="swUqtC"&gt;Voice 2, an energetic, confident female-sounding voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6YrCC"&gt;Voice 3 is similar to Voice 2 but male-sounding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OtUBen"&gt;And finally, Voice 4, which is similar to the default Siri voice that’s been around all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tZcBH0"&gt;If you want to hear what the voices sound like for yourself, they’re in the embedded tweet below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ZG9v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Siri's new voice options in the latest iOS 14.5 Beta &lt;a href="https://t.co/25pUA8kP7V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/25pUA8kP7V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1378024607962128384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5h6cp"&gt;Tapping on a voice will play a snippet of it saying “Hi, I’m Siri. Choose the voice you’d like me to use.” If you choose voices 1–3, it will have to download them before you can use them, but you don’t have to stay in the Settings app while it does so. Once it’s finished downloading, Siri will respond with your chosen voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlKF9C"&gt;This process is unlikely to change in the final version, but if it does, we’ll be sure to update this how-to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: WWDC rumors, Clubhouse competition, and the cookiepocalypse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ImdIdIa4RQmHOha3iu0cbhMxLvI=/0x52:1472x1033/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066606/hero_m1_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urvyXL"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obF0zU"&gt;This week, Nilay and Dieter talk with &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;deputy editor Dan Seifert about this week’s rumors about the next big Apple product announcements after invites were sent out for the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22320961/apple-wwdc-2021-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos"&gt;annual WWDC event&lt;/a&gt;, which will again be virtual-only. After more &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/22/kuo-apple-headset-to-have-ultra-short-focal-length-lenses-and-weigh-less-than-150-grams/"&gt;AR headset leaks&lt;/a&gt;, the crew also discusses whether Apple has the bandwidth to support all of its product categories, especially with the Apple TV left alone for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ivet70"&gt;Later in the show, senior reporter Ashley Carman joins to discuss her coverage of social audio platform Clubhouse. Recently, we’ve seen a rise in potential competition in the social audio space from already-established platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505519/slack-instagram-stories-push-to-talk-audio-calls-new-features"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;. Ashley analyzes whether there is a winner-takes-all scenario or a more segmented space dedicated to genres of content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUdJLu"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in the show — like Dieter’s explanation of the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;cookiepocalypse&lt;/a&gt;” brought by Google Chrome’s changes to ad tracking on the browser — so listen to the full discussion here or on your preferred podcast player to hear it all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade just got a huge update of new games, including some mobile classics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3yyBfDi59-rgjwgEpSr71IKT38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69065582/akrales_190918_3645_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1avaZy"&gt;Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362624/fantasian-release-date-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;the latest release from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which is joined by other titles like new versions of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Oregon Trail&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; World of Demons &lt;/em&gt;from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehBqNs"&gt;For the greats, Apple is adding a number of high-profile mobile hits to the service, including &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mini Metro&lt;/em&gt;, and a remaster of &lt;em&gt;Cut the Rope&lt;/em&gt;. Timeless classics, meanwhile, refers to iconic games like backgammon, solitaire, and Zach Gage’s recent takes on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13262994/really-bad-chess-zach-gage-iphone-ipad"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334116/good-sudoku-iphone-ipad-app-game-zach-gage"&gt;sudoku&lt;/a&gt;. While most Arcade games are playable across Apple TV, Mac, and iOS, these new categories will only work on iPhone and iPad. The update adds more than 30 titles to the service, bringing the entire library to more than 180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYldDU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20870146/apple-arcade-launch-best-top-games-iphone-ipad-apple-tv"&gt;Apple Arcade first launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman"&gt;a new option for premium games&lt;/a&gt; on a platform that had become dominated by free-to-play experiences. The original pitch was a service full of new, largely exclusive games from developers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt; and a number of indie stalwarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4Th5X"&gt;However, despite the quality games and relative low price (an Arcade subscription is $4.99 per month), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308657/apple-arcade-canceling-games-subscription-service-engagement"&gt;Apple is reportedly not happy&lt;/a&gt; with the amount of engagement games are getting, which may be a reason behind this most recent shift in direction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple knew it was selling defective MacBook displays, judge concludes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Flexgate issue causes the display’s backlight to malfunction, dimming at regular intervals near the bottom of the screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0BIfEdVZzmkrPxXolKisYVu6Gs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064097/flexgate_vladsavov1__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DAzbE4"&gt;When Apple introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13548052/the-macbook-pro-lie"&gt;controversial MacBook Pro redesign&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, the company probably didn’t know it was setting itself up to get sued — but not only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344397/apple-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-switches-defective-class-action-lawsuit-certified"&gt;is a class-action lawsuit now underway&lt;/a&gt; for their infamous butterfly keyboards, it’s looking likely there’ll be a second one for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251264/macbook-pro-2018-flexgate-fix-display-cable-2mm-longer"&gt;their notoriously fragile display cables&lt;/a&gt;, too. Judge Edward Davila has decided to let the “flexgate” lawsuit go forward, ruling that Apple should have known that they would fail and yet kept selling them anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGd5Oh"&gt;“The court finds that the allegations of pre-release testing in combination with the allegations of substantial customer complaints are sufficient to show that Apple had exclusive knowledge of the alleged defect,” the judge wrote (via &lt;a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_161732083860310&amp;amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;amp;libId=kmzhlj98010023dg000DLcw7ilyuh&amp;amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F04%2F01%2Fdefective-macs-stage-light%2F&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.law360.com%2Farticles%2F1370714%2Fapple-must-face-trimmed-defective-laptop-display-suit&amp;amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.asana.com%2F&amp;amp;title=Defective%20Macs%20%27knowingly%20sold%20by%20Apple%27%20in%20stage%20light%20case%20-%209to5Mac&amp;amp;txt=Law360"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Law360&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/01/defective-macs-stage-light/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). You can read the full order at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xokUox"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Also known as stage light&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsXos0"&gt;To see what the issue looked like, just take a peek at our picture atop this post; it’s sometimes called the “stage light” issue because of how the cable damage would produce those dark spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kQg0j"&gt;Part of the flexgate controversy is around how Apple addressed the issue when it first got publicity in late 2018 — first by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251264/macbook-pro-2018-flexgate-fix-display-cable-2mm-longer"&gt;silently swapping a new, slightly longer cable&lt;/a&gt; into newer MacBooks, and only opening up one of its typical &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634438/flexgate-repair-program-macbook-pro-apple-announced"&gt;free repair programs&lt;/a&gt; months after 15,000 users signed a petition and it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18271733/flexgate-display-problem-macbook-pro-apple"&gt;called out in the press&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s been a lot more responsive with issues ever since, such as with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275582/apple-free-replacement-program-macbook-pro-batteries-2016-2017-one-percent"&gt;this free battery replacement program&lt;/a&gt; for a small number of those 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro laptops that won’t charge anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPhNBv"&gt;Unlike the butterfly keyboard suit, the flexgate one doesn’t appear to be a certified class-action lawsuit yet — but there are now nine different plaintiffs lined up in this single case, and the judge is inviting them to submit a new amended complaint. We’ll be watching to see where it goes from there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s H-1B visa freeze is over</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="American Conservative Union Holds Annual Conference In Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jr4QIiF5bYCA9st8ypuNWxUAZ0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064073/1304610267.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhGpRs"&gt;Former President Donald Trump’s ban on guest worker visas has expired, allowing foreign workers to reapply for entry into the United States. The news is a win for tech companies including Apple, Twitter, and Google, each of which vocally opposed the policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SZewo"&gt;Former President Donald Trump said the ban was a response to rising unemployment in the United States, due to the coronavirus pandemic. On the campaign trail, Joe Biden pushed back on this claim, calling it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1275430918946263041"&gt;an attempt to distract from the Trump Administration’s failure on the virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQ0KB6"&gt;The ban focused on H-1B visas, but impacted a broader range of workers, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/01/983579103/biden-allows-trumps-freeze-on-skilled-worker-and-other-visas-to-expire?utm_term=nprnews&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=npr"&gt;NPR reports&lt;/a&gt;. Executives at big corporations and students participating in work-study programs were also caught up in the fray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r59ye1"&gt;Workers already in the United States also had their lives upended. In June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21306188/guest-worker-ban-trump-h1b-visa-immigration-stamp-entry"&gt;an Egyptian tech worker in the Bay Area told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he’d planned to go back to Egypt for his brother’s wedding, but now couldn’t leave the country. “I feel like I’m selectively imprisoned,” he said. “If someone from my family gets sick, I can’t go back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1CfwqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The human cost of Trump’s guest worker ban","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21306188/guest-worker-ban-trump-h1b-visa-immigration-stamp-entry"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5OzA7d"&gt;In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300573/h1b-visa-ban-tim-cook-twitter-donald-trump-statement"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was&lt;/a&gt; “deeply disappointed” by the ban. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1275192967658119169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1275192967658119169%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F6%2F23%2F21300573%2Fh1b-visa-ban-tim-cook-twitter-donald-trump-statement"&gt;Twitter said it undermined&lt;/a&gt; “America’s greatest economic asset: its diversity.” Both companies rely on H-1B visas to hire foreign workers without going through the traditional immigration process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lek4YZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like Apple, this nation of immigrants has always found strength in our diversity, and hope in the enduring promise of the American Dream. There is no new prosperity without both. Deeply disappointed by this proclamation.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1275407136256712707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest you can grab a pair right now is for $199 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $34 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has knocked $30 off this model’s retail price as well, bringing it down to $174. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is $289 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
