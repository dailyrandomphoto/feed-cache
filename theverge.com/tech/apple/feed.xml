    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0FT5Ir"&gt;With Siri now socializing on other smart speakers, Apple took to the stage at its October event to announce a new look for its HomePod Mini smart speaker. In addition to white and black, you will soon be able to pick up a HomePod Mini in yellow, orange, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ql281U"&gt;The new, colorful smart speakers cost the same, $99, and will be available in November.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 Pro processor takes its in-house Arm-based chips to new heights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_atC6FAolFlAq_mPFxTRXv_XVkQ=/194x0:2084x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011926/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_1.16.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lzy4HC"&gt;Apple has officially announced its most powerful chip ever: the M1 Pro, a souped-up version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558095/apple-silicon-m1-chip-arm-macs-soc-charge-power-efficiency-mobile-processor"&gt;the M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; that it debuted last fall and the heart of its new MacBook Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MyN0q"&gt;The original M1 chip was announced a little less than a year ago as Apple’s first in-house, Arm-based chip for laptops. At launch, it was featured in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s revamped MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;the entry-level Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;2021 iMac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad Pro refreshes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MulTxQ"&gt;But as good as the M1 chip was, it was only a solution for replacing Intel on Apple’s entry-to-mid level hardware, with its high-end MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini models (meant for developers, programmers, graphic designers, and other more demanding workloads) all notably still sticking with Intel’s chips for the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8R39h"&gt;The M1 Pro is Apple’s long-awaited answer to that issue. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s new voice-only plan costs $4.99 per month</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g3viTf"&gt;Apple unveiled a new Voice plan for Apple Music during its Unleashed event on Monday that will be $4.99 per month. You can use only your voice and its Siri voice assistant to access all Apple Music content across Apple devices. It will be available later this fall in 17 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eE9bgi"&gt;The plan seems in response to Amazon Music’s Echo plan that’s priced at $3.99/month, which lets you use its Alexa voice assistant to request music via an Echo or Fire TV device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces third-generation AirPods for $179</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NyOewOw7VnmjT0zzEC6Im56oKuQ=/238x0:2659x1614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011892/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_1.11.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M1fVSZ"&gt;Apple has just introduced its third-generation AirPods, the latest set of the company’s massively popular true wireless earbuds. With a new design that blends aspects of the prior AirPods and AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods retain a hard plastic, one-size-fits-most fit in the ear. But the form factor is seeing significant change for the first time since 2016: the new earbuds have much shorter stems than before. Priced at $179, the third-generation AirPods will be available to preorder today and will go on sale next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4qpkZ"&gt;They’re now water and sweat resistant. Battery life has been extended to 6 hours of continuous listening. With the case, you’ll get a total of 30 hours. The new third-gen AirPods have a redesigned custom driver and adaptive EQ that automatically tunes and optimizes audio output. Apple has carried over the “force sensor” controls of the AirPods Pro, and it also says the new AirPods are compatible with its MagSafe charging system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tsMQ-2fUlOhjub7vCA_vircYgig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936579/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_1.14.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s list of features for the third-generation AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mLFgKo"&gt;The company is also putting a big emphasis on spatial audio and Dolby Atmos music mixes with the new AirPods. They’ll support the same head tracking capabilities as the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ6Tic"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;original AirPods&lt;/a&gt; were released in 2016 and were followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;a second-gen pair&lt;/a&gt; that added wireless charging and other modest improvements. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; arrived in 2019 with a more traditional in-ear fit with silicone ear tips. Last year, Apple expanded the AirPods line to cover over-ear headphones for the first time with the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;the $549 AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbkDkL"&gt;There’s a lot riding on the latest AirPods to sustain the huge popularity of their predecessors. Above all else, the earbuds are well regarded for their ease of use and seamless integration with Apple’s ecosystem of hardware, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3CNfp"&gt;But Apple faces more competition than ever before — especially at lower price points. Aside from the latest alternatives from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, Jabra, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Sony, and others, newer entrants like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing&lt;/a&gt; have sought to set themselves apart on design and value with starting prices around $99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pro event live blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple’s event invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15YLNFd7PH2RbmgL3kbAafD-J4s=/61x0:2047x1324/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011638/Screen_Shot_2021_10_14_at_9.13.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s event invitation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple says something is getting “unleashed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="95O0lC"&gt;Apple is kicking off the very best week in tech with a rare Monday event, one it’s decided to call “Unleashed.” That could refer to any number of things, but at a high level we are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/17/22725365/apple-october-macbook-event-unleashed-rumors-pro-airpods"&gt;expecting it to be about new, redesigned MacBook Pro laptops with Apple’s own processors&lt;/a&gt;. Will they be called M1X, M2, or something else? What will the GPU performance be like? Will battery life match the excellent quality of the original generation of M1 Macs? All open questions we hope to see answered today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqn21b"&gt;There should be two sizes, with 14- and 16-inch screens. There have been long-standing rumors that Apple will bring back an SD card reader slot, MagSafe for charging, and may even switch these Macs over to more advanced, Mini-LED displays. Apple is also said to be doing away with the unloved (except by a few) Touch Bar and will have a regular row of honest-to-goodness function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LemsyG"&gt;There’s also a late-breaking rumor that Apple will put an actually good webcam inside these MacBook Pros. The disappointing webcams were really the only notable downside with the M1 MacBook Air and base-spec MacBook Pro, so that’s overdue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUoNvQ"&gt;The other side of that webcam rumor is talk that the MacBook Pros will have thinner bezels and therefore an actual notch for the webcam. That likely won’t mean it will use face unlock for unlocking the Mac — a feature many Windows computers have had for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAJy6O"&gt;What else? Tough to say! There are a handful of products that we’ve been expecting, ranging from new AirPods to updated Mac Minis — plus of course we need a final release date for macOS Monterey. We’ll be live blogging the whole event, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h8mNjQ"&gt;Apple Unleashed keynote live blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="3JYFI2"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/17647/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple’s ‘Unleashed’ Fall 2021 Mac Event: rumors, news, and announcements </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple October 18th event invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PmHxoyaa0VlCwLB0M0BQXVBBz0c=/94x0:1330x824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70010469/image__7_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT today&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Qjl0gC"&gt;Ever since the MacBook Pro line made significant departures from its winning formula with the introduction of the Touch Bar and the removal of MagSafe charging, people have been clamoring for a return to form. Last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1-powered MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; were a step in the right direction — as was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;revised M1 Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; — but there’s still room to revitalize the “Pro” in MacBook Pro. That is a big part of what’s expected at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;Apple’s next event&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed “Unleashed,” which is scheduled for Monday, October 18th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPOayy"&gt;The rumors have been widespread that Apple will be refreshing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pro with its own silicon&lt;/a&gt; and that a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;new 14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; will be the proper successor to the old 13-inch models long left behind with their MagSafe plugs, SD card slots, and an array of versatile I/O. With new MacBook Pros might also come a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;new, super-powered Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; that sports a revised design, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;third generation of the standard AirPods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORxf4H"&gt;Regardless of what’s announced, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will keep you updated on all the latest news and announcements to be “Unleashed” by Apple on October 18th, including all the rumors and news leading up to the virtual event.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XmKgkS"&gt;It’s been hard to be an Apple power user for the last half-decade. The glory days of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/13/3082649/macbook-pro-review-retina-display-15-inch"&gt;original Retina MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; have long since vanished into the sunset, and recent years have seen computers with too many compromises and too few ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sHmmI"&gt;And while Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;first wave of M1-powered computers&lt;/a&gt; have been excellent, they’ve all been — relatively — low-powered. The MacBook Air, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;M1 MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; are the cheapest computers Apple makes, meant more for checking email, writing essays, and the occasional light photo editing than they are for cranking out 4K video or Photoshop projects hundreds of layers deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGc7pu"&gt;That may be about to change with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;presumed announcement&lt;/a&gt; of new, high-end MacBook Pro models, computers that are rumored to be Apple’s biggest laptop update in years. And new MacBook Pros are an opportunity for the company to get back the professional users that have been underserved and disappointed by the lackluster laptop options that the company has been releasing for several cycles. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GiGuga82ESb5W11HZbajTPY8QeI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7461807/jbareham_161108_1263_0105.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;James Bareham&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="It3gls"&gt;Apple’s last major redesign for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13616404/apple-macbook-pro-touch-bar-review-2016-13-inch-15-inch-laptop"&gt;MacBook Pro came in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and made several missteps: the stripping away of SD card, HDMI, and USB-A ports (all essential tools for photographers, video editors, musicians, and other professional workers) in favor of exclusively using USB-C. There was the addition of the largely useless Touch Bar instead of reliable function keys. And, of course, the extremely fragile keyboard, which was prone to breaking on contact with dust or debris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQ213a"&gt;Subsequent models have tried to address some of those complaints (Apple finally reverted back to the older style keyboard and added a physical escape key to newer models of the MacBook Pro), but the overall approach of what should be Apple’s most functional devices still focus more on the form. Life as a professional on a Mac has meant dealing with too many dongles, buying new cables, and endlessly hunting around for an SD card adapter just to import files. All while getting processors that are years behind Windows devices, with screens that haven’t meaningfully changed since 2012, on computers that Apple charges a premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyk7gX"&gt;And hardcore users have been waiting for a while, especially compared to Apple’s last chip changeover. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;Apple first announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be transitioning its entire product lineup over to Apple Silicon products in 2020 (and away from the Intel chips that it had used since its last major architecture switch in 2005), it announced a two-year goal of getting all its products switched over. But a year in, and only Apple’s least powerful devices have made the change. If you want a more powerful laptop or desktop, then you’re still getting the old Intel models — models that, while still not on Apple Silicon hardware, also haven’t been updated with new &lt;em&gt;Intel&lt;/em&gt; hardware in over a year and a half either. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hblvj1"&gt;The most powerful 16-inch MacBook Pro you can buy right now — ostensibly Apple’s best and beefiest laptop — features a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950968/intel-9th-gen-core-chips-2018-desktop-processors-8-core-i9-9900k"&gt;9th-generation Intel Core i7 processor from early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Mac users aren’t just missing out on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;new 11th Gen Tiger Lake chips announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, bringing generational changes in battery life and performance; they didn’t even get the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21203222/intel-10th-gen-h-series-laptop-processors-comet-lake-14nm-5-ghz-clock-speeds-gaming"&gt;more modest upgrades&lt;/a&gt; from Intel’s 2020 10th-gen chips, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJxb3I"&gt;Compare this whole sluggish Apple Silicon transition to the original Intel one, which happened much more swiftly; Apple announced the change in June 2005, released the first Intel-based Macs in January 2006, and had completely switched over its full product line with the Intel-powered Mac Pro in August 2006 — just eight months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2sH5E"&gt;Apple managed to change its entire lineup to Intel in just over a year, from announcement to release, the last time around. But with Apple Silicon, we’re already a year into this transition, and there are still a lot of crucial, unanswered questions. The current M1 chips only offer integrated GPUs, with no discrete graphics options available for more graphically intensive tasks (like those that video editors or graphic designers might need). Apple doesn’t sell an M1 device with more than 16GB of RAM, nor does it offer a laptop with more than two USB4 / Thunderbolt 4 ports — all areas that the company would likely have to address in some fashion on a pro-focused machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XZas6"&gt;Plus, if Apple does fail at translating the success of its M1 chips to its more powerful machines, Intel is still ready and willing to try and pick up the slack. “I never give up on the idea of anything not running on Intel chips,” commented Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/axios/status/1449891228099694597"&gt;in an interview with Axios&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple decided that they could do a better chip than we could, and they did a pretty good job. So what I have to do is create a better chip than they can do themselves...  I’m gonna fight hard to win Tim [Cook’s] business in this area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tPsYqp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A year in, and there’s a lot of unanswered questions for professional-level Apple Silicon computers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1eL96N"&gt;There are theoretical benefits to the delay: developers have had a full year to transition their apps over to Apple’s M1 architecture. Things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176548/microsoft-office-native-m1-apps-apple-silicon-support"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584992/adobe-premiere-pro-apple-m1-support"&gt;key creative applications&lt;/a&gt; like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere, and Lightroom have all been natively ported to Apple’s new chips, and those updates took months to roll out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuS6ZX"&gt;Plus, a switch to Apple’s own in-house chips might not just mean the kind of performance and speed boosts that customers have been enjoying on the company’s less powerful machines. It also could mean an end to the glacial pace of upgrades for Mac processors. With Intel chips, Apple’s computers almost universally lagged behind their Windows-based competitors, taking months or even years to upgrade to Intel’s latest chips (and the performance and power benefits that newer silicon provided).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSxEtV"&gt;And if the rumors are correct, Apple is taking the new chips as an opportunity to roll out a new design for its MacBook Pro line, with bigger, better Mini LED displays, smaller bezels, more ports, and even the return of its breakaway magnetic MagSafe chargers — changes that would both modernize the lineup to be more on par with Windows competitors (which have long since lapped Apple in things like display technology) in addition to rolling back some of the more controversial aspects of the Touch Bar era. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um9Ija"&gt;With the first wave of Apple Silicon Macs, Apple proved it could make the best laptops around for &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people. But Apple’s new MacBook Pros aren’t just about winning over power users — it’s a chance to prove that Apple Silicon (and the traditionally mobile-focused Arm technology it uses) can not only match but exceed what Intel and AMD have accomplished for years with x86 for high-end use cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5Ephw"&gt;And if Apple can succeed at that, it won’t just mean better laptops or desktops, but what could be the start of changing how we fundamentally think about designing computers — at least the inside of them — going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apuU1H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZJaLg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s October ‘Unleashed’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vAoo21g2vesfpuBQi45zuAl_5pI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009811/acstro_190902_apple_event_0005.0.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5tZSlE"&gt;Apple is hosting its next big hardware event at 10AM PT / 1PM ET. The event is titled “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810"&gt;Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;,” and while we’re not totally sure what Apple will be unleashing, the dotted-font design on the invitation could be a hint at the higher-res &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590004/macbook-air-mini-led-display-apple-silicon-2022-redesign"&gt;Mini LED displays&lt;/a&gt; expected for new MacBook Pros. These new, more powerful MacBook Pros will probably come in 14- and 16-inch screen sizes and may have SD readers, HDMI, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;MagSafe&lt;/a&gt; ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1FC9o"&gt;And possibly (finally) Apple may release new AirPods as well. It also seems likely we’ll get a release date for macOS Monterey, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;which was announced&lt;/a&gt; at the same time as iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 but remains in beta. The rumor mill also has been predicting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;end of the Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CR1IjE"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE APPLE “UNLEASHED” EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You can tune into the livestream, which starts at 10AM PT / 1PM ET on Monday, October 18th. If you miss the livestream, it’s likely you’ll be able to catch a replay after the event wraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH IT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XbxczI"&gt;Apple is hosting the stream on its &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and it is also streaming it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exM1uajp--A&amp;amp;ab_channel=Apple"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. The YouTube stream is embedded above for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s October ‘Unleashed’ event: what to expect</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ee4V3fDWnHBA-iJFEDSDi6kmhE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70006949/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNYIIT"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;announced an event for October 18th&lt;/a&gt;, with a video containing the title “Unleashed.” If you’ve been watching the rumor mill, it won’t come as a surprise — the company still has a lot of products that are expected to come out this year but haven’t shown up in an Apple keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGTo0P"&gt;Chief among those are new, more powerful MacBook Pros, which will follow the incredible Apple Silicon-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;launched last November&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also expected to release new AirPods, and it’s got an entire OS that was announced but hasn’t shipped. Read on for a deep dive into the rumors surrounding these products and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8GOXLV"&gt;Redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JOdB06"&gt;Most of the rumors about the event concern redesigned MacBook Pros, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;expected to feature 14- and 16-inch screens&lt;/a&gt;, along with a new Apple processor. Mark Gurman and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/"&gt;Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt; (who have pretty solid track records when it comes to rumors) have both said that the laptops will feature iPhone 12-esque flat sides with a redesigned MagSafe charging port and that they’ll no longer have the Touch Bar that’s been a staple of many MacBook Pros since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X7XVE4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ports, glorious ports&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yUBXN1"&gt;Apple is also rumored to be bringing ports back to its laptops with the redesign. The new MacBooks Pros may include an SD card reader and HDMI &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;and MagSafe ports&lt;/a&gt;, which will be familiar (and possibly beloved) by people who miss the days when MacBooks had more than one type of port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IPyTE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-set-for-first-macbook-pro-revamp-in-five-years-on-oct-18"&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt; that the laptops will be powered by new chips, which are expected to be more powerful variants of the M1 processor found in today’s computers. The “M1X” (or M2, or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1448040028832034817"&gt;whatever name Apple actually goes with&lt;/a&gt;) is expected to have more high-performance cores than its predecessor (eight instead of four) and even offer a choice of 16 or 32 graphics cores (compared to the M1’s seven or eight). What’s still unclear is whether the new processor will do away with any of the seeming limitations of the M1: none of the Apple Silicon Macs are configurable with more than 16GB of RAM or 2TB of storage, they can’t run more than two displays, and none of them have more than two Thunderbolt ports (the iMac has at most two Thunderbolt ports and two USB-C ports). Traditionally, the higher-end MacBook Pros have four Thunderbolt ports, though the inclusion of MagSafe and HDMI may make that less necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hi34v1GQ6fbP3rgqAvJmkjaDtJQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22848631/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_5.21.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The configuration screen for an Intel-based MacBook Pro. Just having options for graphics cores would be much easier to explain to new buyers than Turbo Boosts and base clocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrfJmQ"&gt;If you’re thinking, “Wow, these new computers sound like everything I ever could’ve wanted,” you’re not alone — a lot of people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1448073292401815552?s=20"&gt;are hyped about the rumors&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s worth keeping in mind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"&gt;that those don’t always pan out&lt;/a&gt;). If it turns out that Apple has taken all of the community’s feedback to heart, the chip shortage could make these laptops hot-ticket items for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PcLJiF"&gt;A Pro Mac Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xpSfDk"&gt;Gurman also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that a more powerful Mac mini would be coming soon, featuring the same processor found in the updated MacBook Pros and more ports than are currently available on the M1-powered Mini. It’s an interesting rumor because the M1 Mini has one of the widest port selections available on an M1 Mac with USB-A, HDMI, two Thunderbolt ports, and optional 10-gigabit ethernet. But the 2018 Intel-based version, which a lot of people think of as the Mac Mini Pro (in part due to its space grey color), has all of that &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; two more Thunderbolt ports. For those looking for a powerful Apple-powered desktop, a replacement for the 2018 Mac Mini could be a great option, given the lack of rumors about a 27-inch iMac.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QY8S1M6eh04Y9-69e2-O4oqQJ9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925277/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_4.51.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is still selling the Intel-powered 2018 Mac Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zOUVY6"&gt;New AirPods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chmWak"&gt;Gurman, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/12/kuo-airpods-3-to-be-announced-at-september-event-airpods-2-to-remain-in-the-lineup/"&gt;Kuo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;all reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple is working on a follow-up to its regular, non-Pro AirPods and have said that the headphones will feature the shorter stems found on their more expensive counterparts. It feels like AirPods would’ve fit in better at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s iPhone event&lt;/a&gt;, but given that they were absent, we may end up seeing them on the 18th. There is also always the (hilarious) possibility that Apple just announces them via press release like it did the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936454/apple-airpods-pro-new-release-date-price-noise-cancellation-design-immersive-sound"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt;, but with how popular the original ones were, it feels like their successors should get some event time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple announced macOS Monterey in June.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EePdlG"&gt;A macOS Monterey release date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRQ2vB"&gt;Apple has released iOS and iPadOS 15, but macOS Monterey, which was announced alongside them, is still in beta. It would be a bit strange if Apple released new Macs that were running macOS Big Sur out of the box, especially given that Monterey was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;announced about three months ago at WWDC&lt;/a&gt;. If Apple doesn’t announce that the new version of macOS is shipping with the redesigned MacBook Pros, I’ll be pretty surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uUNI6p"&gt;On October 14th, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement"&gt;fired a leader of the #AppleToo movement&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly failing to comply with an internal investigation. The employee, Janneke Parrish, has been working behind the scenes for months to organize fellow employees who’ve faced harassment and discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mujZpQ"&gt;Now, Apple appears to be cracking down on those efforts — under the guise of trying to stop internal information from leaking to the press. In September, Apple fired Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly violating her confidentiality agreement. Then, it placed software engineer Cher Scarlett on medical leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQWGW4"&gt;Both Gjøvik and Scarlett have filed claims with the NLRB. Parrish’s lawyer, Vincent P. White of White, Hilferty and Albanese, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Parrish plans to sue for wrongful termination and will also be filing a charge with the NLRB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLOmo5"&gt;Parrish spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about her organizing efforts and the circumstances around her termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hhBFfR"&gt;
&lt;p id="wiYBzL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me what the last few months have been like for you. You started doing internal advocacy with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Antonio García Martínez&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;letter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9xD2s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janneke Parrish:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, and that was the first time I really saw employee activism at Apple having an impact. I was already in the remote work advocacy Slack channel at the time, wanting people to be able to make the best decisions for them in regards to how and where they work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoXJkT"&gt;But with the Antonio García Martínez letter, we saw that activism can be effective — that when we speak up, executives might listen. That led to more letters from the remote work group, asking for flexibility in terms of where we work. But we didn’t get the same response this time — the response was essentially, “We think it would be better to be back in the office.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOag5Q"&gt;Employee advocacy is incredibly important to help make our voices heard, but there’s a limit to what we can do internally. If you’re speaking to people who don’t want to listen to you, you might as well not be speaking at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I50LGh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you and Cher Scarlett start working together on #AppleToo?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga1VAc"&gt;While I was doing this work with remote advocacy, Cher was doing work with pay advocacy. We met through needing to advocate for pay equity and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;transitioned it into #AppleToo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTnJak"&gt;I led the employee stories component — telling the stories of workers who’ve been abused and discriminated against, who’ve reached out through the channels Apple tells us to and heard nothing. It’s the story of remote advocacy being told on a macro scale across the entire business — that we are consistently unheard and devalued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JwNQWB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple doesn’t need to know how much money I lost on GameStop.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wVM59P"&gt;I do not know how somebody looks at hundreds of stories like that and does not take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFBYg2"&gt;So I’ve been doing that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxFe7l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the impact been? It seems like you haven’t gotten the same pushback internally as Cher and Ashley.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OPwWQ"&gt;I have received a lot of supportive messages, and no, I haven’t gotten as much criticism. I honestly don’t know why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCsT6U"&gt;I’m a program manager. I’m not an engineer, and I’m in a department that doesn’t have the same visibility theirs does. I’m in Maps, and it just doesn’t have the same visibility. I also continue to put myself out of the limelight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E1v2n"&gt;And I’m in Austin, not California. A lot of Apple’s arguments around coming back to the office are very California-centric and don’t apply to people in Texas. They talk about running into people in the halls — I never run into execs in Austin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5Bb3L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did the investigation start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FzVHo"&gt;On September 18th, there was a town hall that was live leaked to you. And afterward, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;Tim Cook sent out a memo&lt;/a&gt; saying we’re disappointed and going to find the leakers. In the wake of that memo, Apple started doing investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYheQe"&gt;On September 30th, I was called into a meeting with HR and global security and told I was being investigated for possibly leaking the meeting. My devices were confiscated, but before they were, I deleted apps with personal information, like Robinhood. Apple doesn’t need to know how much money I lost on GameStop. I work on political campaigns, and Democratic political campaign information has to be kept private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbnYEu"&gt;So before turning in the devices, I removed this information. I was given a loaner and asked to continue working, which I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5p0Sp"&gt;On October 8th, I was reached out to again by global security and HR, and they said I was being suspended and took the loaner devices and deactivated all my internal accounts. I was in mid-conversation with some people, and then my internal accounts immediately showed “deactivated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MSsbqu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I believe I was fired in retaliation for speaking out”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C458fa"&gt;Doing this set my work back as well. The very fact that it happened at all — I work in Maps, we work with highly confidential information, and our need to keep stuff secret is vital for our success. So even being investigated, my career on Maps was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdFkzv"&gt;On Thursday, I received a call from global security and HR saying I had been terminated for deleting the files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hvbuT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was that personal information on your work device in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hcj7er"&gt;On Maps, we’re encouraged to test out the maps and new features. My particular role was the program manager for tools, so I needed to know our tools behaved correctly. For me, using my work phone as a personal phone gave me a great opportunity to test things in the field, which we are highly encouraged to do. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;Apple encourages us to integrate&lt;/a&gt; [our personal and work devices]. When I was first issued the phone, that seemed perfectly legitimate. But in hindsight, it probably was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydbDee"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your view on why you were fired?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjioA6"&gt;I believe I was fired in retaliation for speaking out, for my work with #AppleToo, and out of concern that I was organizing to help other employees tell their stories. In my view, this is entirely retaliation for trying to bring Apple’s actions to light and publicly asking the company to do better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBTLRZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is #AppleToo done now that you’ve been fired and Cher is out on medical leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzEsTo"&gt;I absolutely don’t think so. I think seeing that Apple would rather fire an employee for speaking out and asking the company to do better instead of actually &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; better says volumes about the company and its priorities. I hope people see the decision Apple has made and that it is a galvanizing decision. My goal is to make Apple better for everyone. And it seems like Apple is less interested in that than I am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVGtAb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vwVyz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
