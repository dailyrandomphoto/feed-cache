    <title>Apple’s $549 AirPods Max can’t play lossless Apple Music — even when plugged in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69d9CKC7JVxP7_zIM1EuPJy81d0=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301267/DSCF2705_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r06i0y"&gt;Streaming music might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;entering a new era of hi-fi audio&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple’s AirPods Max aren’t technically ready to go along for the ride. The company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its premium noise-canceling headphones do not natively support playback of lossless music files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnkub0"&gt;“Lossless audio is not supported on AirPods, any model,” an Apple spokesperson said by email. “AirPods Max wired listening mode accepts analog output sources only. AirPods Max currently does not support digital audio formats in wired mode.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq6ELI"&gt;It makes complete sense that the AirPods and AirPods Pro have no way of playing lossless audio. They’re totally wireless, and Apple supports the AAC codec over Bluetooth. AAC sounds plenty good, but it’s nowhere near the bit rate of CD-quality or high-resolution tracks. To do any better, Apple would need to come up with some new wireless codec — its own version of Sony’s LDAC, sort of — or make these things play music over Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth. None of that is happening today or by June when Apple Music will start offering lossless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shjiBP"&gt;Things are a little more complicated with the AirPods Max, which &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be plugged into audio sources with a cable. However, it turns out that even if you have Apple’s $35 Lightning-to-3.5mm cable plugged into a device that’s streaming lossless Apple Music tracks, you’re not going to hear the full audio fidelity of the source. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfLJy784kh1AUCVTFVHU8pIrOkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159226/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max don’t support digital audio formats when hard wired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qijZy4"&gt;So the natural question becomes... well, what &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you hearing in that scenario? Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that when you play a 24-bit / 48 kHz Apple Music lossless track from an iPhone into the AirPods Max using both the cable and Lightning dongle, the audio is converted to analog and then re-digitized to 24-bit / 48 kHz. That re-digitization step is the reason that Apple can’t say you’re hearing pure lossless audio; it’s not an identical match to the source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoOJMd"&gt;Is it still going to sound very good? Almost certainly. The AirPods Max sound exceptional — even with AAC over Bluetooth, and plugging in can make the experience richer. But if you’re a stickler for the technical details, this is why the AirPods Max can’t pull off lossless audio in the truest sense. It also leaves Apple in an awkward spot where other high-end headphones that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; support digital audio when hard wired — over USB-C, for example — could deliver the full lossless audio that the AirPods Max can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4HjWj"&gt;The Apple Music spatial audio feature also announced today &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; work on the AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. So any songs that have those Dolby Atmos mixes are going to feel more immersive than their stereo counterparts. I think Apple suspects spatial audio will be a bigger deal for many customers than lossless quality — and it may be right. But hopefully the company also has a long-term plan for increasing the fidelity on its wireless headphones, especially now that lossless doesn’t cost anything extra. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants you to know it chose not to take a cut of $400 billion in physical goods </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="phil schiller stock 2015" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRuNIiR8ZxOfS5m6Tc5J9TCzqA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300846/verge-2015-09-09_12-31-45.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUS15t"&gt;Apple is trying to convince a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423567/apple-epic-app-store-policies-fortnite-trial-day-4"&gt;that it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; milking the App Store for all it’s worth&lt;/a&gt;, and today the company dropped some big numbers to help make its case. Apple claims that its App Store drove $400 billion worth of physical purchases in a single year in 2019, and that — unlike digital purchases and subscriptions — Apple doesn’t take a cent of that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMyZWo"&gt;That’s according to App Store boss and longtime Apple marketing exec Phil Schiller, who also testified that the company spends a staggering $50 million a year to throw its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event. The company’s also building a new developer center at its Apple Loop headquarters in Cupertino, he says, though I didn’t catch how much the company’s investing in that. None of these are included in the App Store’s budget, Schiller testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ok6hdJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Schiller says in 2019 App Store drove $400 billion+ in transactions of physical goods, so food delivery, Amazon, Uber/Lyft, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Judge interjects. “Billion with a b?” It’s a big number, and Schiller confirms Apple doesn’t take a cut of that.&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Statt (@nickstatt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1394363213932863488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kScH5F"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Schiller’s going over the explanation Apple has given before for why it doesn’t take a commission on physical goods: it can’t guarantee they actually arrive. (This logic goes for things like Lyft/Uber as well, per earlier discussion.)&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1394362691859492869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6t7Er"&gt;Why isn’t Apple trying to take a cut of physical purchases? During his testimony, Schiller explained that Apple couldn’t guarantee they would actually arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9F1N9L"&gt;But I also imagine it might have been a hard sell with developers: can Apple really argue that it drove those $400 billion in purchases by itself? If I’m going to buy something online, I’ll probably start by whipping out my phone, but I’ve got a laptop with a perfectly good web browser right here to buy those same items, if an app doesn’t immediately do the job. Amazon knows this, and used it to bypass Apple’s digital cut on movies and shows, too, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"&gt;until it got a better deal&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller"&gt;Digital books are a different matter&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GwhEyz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Read Steve Jobs’ emails about why you can’t buy digital books in Amazon’s apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller"},{"title":"Why Amazon got out of the Apple App Store tax, and why other developers won’t","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="j1bzfO"&gt;Even without a cut of physical purchases, Apple’s App Store cut is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to rake in $64 billion for the company each year&lt;/a&gt;, with profit margins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;approaching a ludicrous 78 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Apple seems to attempting to argue that because things like WWDC aren’t included in the App Store’s costs, the real profit margin is lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oqDxaI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;basically, we are establishing in the law’s tedious way there are lots of App Store benefits that aren’t really… the App Store itself. attempting to undermine Epic’s claims about the profit margin, and establish that the App Store can’t be separated from the phone itself.&lt;/p&gt;— Elizabeth Lopatto (@mslopatto) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mslopatto/status/1394410945896607745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dXfgHH"&gt;Schiller testified that 84 percent of all App Store apps are completely free, with roughly 75 percent of all games on the App Store completely free. Of those games, approximately 17 percent are freemium (requiring in-app purchases to unlock content) and 6 percent are paid, leaving just 2 percent on a subscription model if we do the math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WH4w2j"&gt;Schiller also said today that Apple has spent $100 billion on research and development over the past fifteen years, $18 billion of that just last year in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr8LMI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 6:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added line and embedded tweet about the point Apple appears to be trying to make today by touting all of its investments in the iPhone and iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unannounced Beats Studio Buds appear in Apple’s latest beta software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZn4KWrHQuA-cJuq6ZJjQ6McE0c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300318/DSCF5800.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YVUMMi"&gt;Aside from churning out some limited edition colors, Beats has been in a bit of a quiet period since the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;the Beats Flex last October&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems that the Apple-owned brand is preparing to launch some new, high-end earbuds. As spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are images of “Beats Studio Buds” in the latest beta releases of iOS and tvOS. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/17/exclusive-these-are-apples-new-truly-wireless-in-ear-beats-studio-earbuds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also uncovered images of the charging case and some system animations of the earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0cddl"&gt;The unannounced earbuds look much different than the Powerbeats Pro, which have become a popular pick among the fitness crowd. These don’t have any ear hooks whatsoever, and they seem to have a diagonal steam that extends slightly upward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cRM2SAivqimLhJi-GGG5tQc_CXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520853/beats.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwUzHB"&gt;These images being included in “release candidate” builds of Apple’s software could mean that the Beats Studio Buds are due to be announced in the near future. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Beats for comment. According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;, the code pertaining to the earbuds confirms they’ll have noise cancellation, which is something that all Beats earbuds currently lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnnNfQ"&gt;Apple is also expected to update its main AirPods earbuds sometime this year with a revamped design featuring shortened stems and other aesthetic details borrowed from the AirPods Pro. But they’re likely to retain the hard plastic, one-size-fits-most fit. Beats, however, seems to be sticking with silicone tips for an in-ear seal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GisLML"&gt;Beats has been going through a transition period after former president Luke Wood departed Apple last year. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/05/14/apple-beats-isnt-dead-yet-with-new-designer-reportedly-designing-new-products"&gt;Recently, it’s been rumored&lt;/a&gt; that Scott Croyle, formerly of HTC, is playing a significant role in Beats hardware design. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to make an AirTag holder for your pet’s collar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzttfcZZg-DE7iVzlfQ8d3zQmGM=/0x88:2040x1448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298626/verge_IMG_7566_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hank being a good boy with an AirTag sleeve fitted to his existing dog collar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocCNe3"&gt;One seemingly obvious use for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag&amp;amp;sharedid=vergeairtagholderpet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29 AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt; is for pets. As a new dog owner, I wanted to add an AirTag to my dog’s existing leather collar, but the options currently available are lousy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjrJAr"&gt;AirTags are small, but they’re not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; small. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fairtag&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22439970%2Fpet-airtag-holder-dog-cat-collar-how-to-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Most AirTag holders&lt;/a&gt; currently available from Apple and its partners assume I’m okay with dangling a 0.39-ounce (11-gram) pendant off my medium-sized beagle’s neck. I’m not, which is how I came up with the idea for a DIY neoprene sleeve that keeps the IP67 water- and dust-resistant AirTag snuggly attached to Hank’s existing collar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mE3gf7"&gt;I’m not going to suggest that AirTags are the best way to track your pets — they’re not. But they’re relatively cheap, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-gps-pet-trackers/"&gt;dedicated GPS / GSM pet trackers&lt;/a&gt; that require monthly subscriptions. Apple’s Find My network coverage is also more limited. Nevertheless, an AirTag is better than nothing, especially in populated areas where any nearby iPhone can alert you to your missing pet’s location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="K7nISO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kZy_FBQ2NrPfmtHmQwYAGs9D_ro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519991/verge_IMG_7489_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sewn version of the AirTag sleeve and the dog collar it was designed for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F26NeP"&gt;Why not buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6OfWYP"&gt;A few companies have already announced AirTag accessories designed specifically for pets. The problem is that none of them are currently shipping, and most are downright expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ldl1as"&gt;There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeAirpodPetTags&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-pet-tag-airtag-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29.95 Nomad Rugged Pet Tag&lt;/a&gt; case, which can be engraved with your phone number for an extra $19.95. But it’s still just a pendant and doesn’t ship until August. There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.studioproper.com.au/products/dogtag"&gt;€19.95AUD Studio Proper DogTag&lt;/a&gt; that fits snuggly to existing collars but doesn’t ship until the end of July. And finally, there’s the expensive &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.followpaw.com%2Fproducts%2Ffollowpaw-dog-collar&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22439970%2Fpet-airtag-holder-dog-cat-collar-how-to-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$47.95 FollowPaw collar&lt;/a&gt; with built-in AirTag pocket, which doesn’t ship until June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGyXkk"&gt;One day, I’ll probably buy a dedicated AirTag holder for my dog — one that fits snuggly to his existing collar and comes engraved with his name and my phone number so that I can remove his redundant dog tag. Until then, DIY seems like the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtE_EAbr5Un32piTYC01K4HwHtY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519973/verge_IMG_7515_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll need scissors, neoprene fabric, and either neoprene glue (easy!) or the ability to sew (easy for some!).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YkkKlo"&gt;Materials needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IH6UIl"&gt;My AirTag sleeve is built from neoprene, a durable and stretchy material that’s easy to find. I’d suggest buying it from a local crafts or fabric store so you can check out the colors, thicknesses, and stretchiness in person. You might even be able to haggle for a few free scraps instead of buying in bulk as required by most Amazon sellers. The neoprene I used is 2mm thick and lacks any additional waterproofing, allowing it to be soft and stretchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3H7Irx"&gt;If sewing isn’t an option, then you’ll need some neoprene glue. As an avid surfer, I had easy access to scraps of neoprene, which I could assemble into a tube with the neoprene glue in my wetsuit repair kit. For everyone else, you can expect the glue and neoprene to cost no more than $10 in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EKn0AK"&gt;Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="bmAvKk"&gt;Cut the neoprene into a rectangle about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) in length and wide enough to wrap snugly around your pet’s existing collar with enough overlapping material to either glue or sew it into place. A longer tube might help prevent the AirTag from popping out over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="Xf6DhZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10504284"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KsQjok"&gt;Shape into a tube that just fits the width of the pet collar and then glue or sew the neoprene into shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="Njzclo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10504291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rVM5Yu"&gt;Slide the collar through the tube, then slowly work the AirTag into one end of the neoprene sleeve until it is centered. It helps to rotate the AirTag as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FNNAjX"&gt;Attach to dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Amazon stops charging extra for lossless music as Apple enters the fray</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tm0pn5XlTNwwYyvAmjOSZLokV1U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298248/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UN6rLG"&gt;Faced with new competition from Apple, Amazon today announced that it will no longer charge an added fee for the “HD” tier of Amazon Music that lets customers stream audio at CD quality and above. From now on, lossless audio will be available to all Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers at no extra charge. &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9573513/amazon-music-hd-unlimited-hi-fi-price-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; was first to report the development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ki5Wg"&gt;This makes Amazon the first company to offer lossless music at the industry’s standard $9.99 subscription rate. Amazon Music Unlimited is even cheaper ($7.99 per month) for Prime customers. And yes, the high-quality audio will also now be available for customers paying that price. Family plans are eligible for Amazon Music HD at no added cost, but student plans are exempt. Before Amazon entered the picture, the going rate for a lossless music subscription was $19.99; that’s what Tidal continues to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jByEyy"&gt;What’s making this change possible? Well, as &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; points out, with all the music streaming heavyweights now going in on lossless audio, music labels care more about pushing up subscriber count totals across these services than the higher subscription premiums that they previously demanded for hi-res audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f77R4W"&gt;The price drop for Amazon Music HD comes on the very same day Apple announced the launch of lossless audio on Apple Music. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439885/apple-music-tease-hi-fi-lossless-music-streaming"&gt;teased significant news&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend after rumors began swirling late last week about the possibility. The company’s Apple Music Android app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;spilled the details a bit early&lt;/a&gt; and signaled that an announcement could be imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZkkTB"&gt;Amazon Music HD has been performing strongly for Amazon. A previous &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; report said the service is up 100 percent year over year. The service offers over 70 million songs in CD quality, with over 7 million exceeding that and available in “ultra HD” quality. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces lossless Apple Music is coming in June at no added cost</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wvFk2LBC5fkulgzL0s-p--sSWlA=/0x0:2490x1660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298201/applemusic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIrmwc"&gt;Apple Music is getting two big updates next month: support for high-quality, lossless audio and for spatial audio through Dolby Atmos. But even more surprising, the features will be available for free to all subscribers, including those on family and student plans. The company says it’ll have 75 million lossless audio songs in its catalog by the end of the year and 20 million to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swGTf9"&gt;Apple has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that lossless audio is exclusive to Apple Music and thus subscription-only. The company won’t offer music purchases in lossless quality, nor will there be any way to upgrade owned tracks to lossless with the paid iTunes Match service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ZY83"&gt;To turn on lossless audio, subscribers must run the latest version of Apple Music and can go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Audio Quality. There, they can opt into different resolutions for different connections, like cellular, Wi-Fi, or for download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8F2ptn"&gt;Apple Music’s lossless audio starts at CD quality, which is 16 bit at 44.1 kHz, and goes up to 24 bit at 48 kHz natively on Apple devices. It tops out at 24 bit at 192 kHz. For the highest-quality “High-Resolution Lossless” experience, there’s one major catch: subscribers will need external equipment like a DAC to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiJjoi"&gt;Spatial audio and Dolby Atmos audio could prove to be an even bigger deal for Apple Music listeners. It’ll provide more immersive mixes for anyone listening through recent AirPods or Beats headphones that use the H1 or W1 chip. Spatial audio will also play through the built-in speakers on the latest versions of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac by default. To turn it on for other headphones, users will have to go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Audio and set Dolby Atmos to “Always On.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WP2Mt3"&gt;Spatial audio will be compatible with most Apple devices made in the last few years, including the Apple TV 4K connected to a compatible TV or receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DF8j3E"&gt;Lossless audio is now becoming standard across the biggest music streaming apps. Amazon just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s making Amazon Music HD available for free to Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, and Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;plans to launch&lt;/a&gt; its HiFi tier later this year. Tidal also offers what it calls “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://tidal.com/masters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22059314__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tidal Masters&lt;/a&gt;” that can even exceed high-resolution 96 kHz / 24 bit audio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler returns to Apple App Store with some content excluded</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Parler’s logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhBZOnx2uDbyOXB0f_Ta1m-KoEg=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298112/1230591653.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x7GbGt"&gt;The iOS app for conservative-leaning social media platform Parler is back in the Apple App Store today, after what the company says were “months of productive dialogue with Apple.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MU99pp"&gt;“The entire Parler team has worked hard to address Apple’s concerns without compromising our core mission,” Parler interim CEO Mark Meckler said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday. “Anything allowed on the Parler network but not in the iOS app will remain accessible through our web-based and Android versions. This is a win-win for Parler, its users, and free speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNY0VW"&gt;Parler, which bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook or Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;was banned by&lt;/a&gt; Apple and Google, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;suspended by&lt;/a&gt; Amazon following the January 6th insurrection at the US Capitol. The companies said Parler had not adequately handled violent threats and hateful content on its platform that encouraged the riot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgPcBu"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391943/apple-parler-app-store-lawmakers-hearing-google-play"&gt;reaccepted Parler&lt;/a&gt; last month, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324028/apple-parler-app-store-ban-upheld-nazi-symbols"&gt;initially rejecting its application&lt;/a&gt; for re-entry in March; Apple said at the time Parler still had “highly objectionable content,” including Nazi imagery and other hate symbols. Parler says its algorithm can now “automatically detect violent or inciting content, while still preserving user privacy. Such content has always violated Parler’s guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77C8aG"&gt;Parler remains banned in Google’s Play Store, although users can still sideload the app on Android. Parler sued Amazon, which had provided the site’s web hosting, but the suit has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;so far not fared well&lt;/a&gt; in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JCsSa"&gt;As Meckler noted in his statement, Parler’s iOS app adheres to Apple’s requirements and “excludes some content that Parler otherwise allows,” the company said in a press release. “However, that content is still visible, at the user’s discretion, on the web-based and Android versions of the platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPtXyE"&gt;After the January deplatforming, Parler struggled to resurface on the web. Former CEO John Matze said at one point even the company’s vendors and lawyers had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;“ditched” him&lt;/a&gt;. Matze was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265298/parlers-ceo-has-been-fired"&gt;fired in February&lt;/a&gt;, he said, by a board that included Rebekah Mercer, of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565344/parler-funding-conservative-mercer-app-trump-twitter-facebook"&gt;prominent conservative&lt;/a&gt; Mercer family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdXYkr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple teases major Music announcement as lossless streaming rumors mount</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/114Qih1BN4Gm7ubZptERHIF8OQU=/1x0:1111x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297485/msedge_ebejRVkHMS.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the teaser in Apple Music’s web app.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://music.apple.com" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MjXNwG"&gt;Apple is teasing a major Apple Music announcement. “Get ready,” a post in the service’s Browse tab reads, “music is about to change forever.” Tapping the image reveals an animated video, though it just consists of the music streaming service’s logo spinning in place. The teaser, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/16/apple-music-about-to-change-forever/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;first reported by MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is believed to refer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Apple Music’s rumored lossless and hi-res music streaming&lt;/a&gt; features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpuSpB"&gt;A launch of the new higher quality streaming is believed to be imminent after code referencing “Lossless” and “Hi Res Lossless” streaming tiers appeared in the service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/16/lossless-audio-references-found-in-apple-music-web-app-as-company-teases-special-announcement/"&gt;web apps&lt;/a&gt;. According to code in the Android app, the lossless tier will support music streaming at 24-bit/48Hz (a small step up from regular CD-quality 16-bit/44.1kHz), while the hi-res lossless tier will stream at 24-bit/192 kHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ScrJRu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/BEsuEUK7tr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BEsuEUK7tr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MacRumors/status/1394046356868771844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DlFqXh"&gt;Code in the Android app warns that these higher quality tiers will required more storage space and data to stream compared to existing quality. Apple Music’s current high quality tier consumes 6 MB of data for a 3-minute song, but this could rise to 36 MB with lossless, and 145 MB with hi-res lossless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFFxST"&gt;The benefit, of course, should be better sounding audio, similar to what’s already offered by the likes of Tidal, Amazon Music HD, and Deezer. Spotify has also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;its own lossless HiFi tier&lt;/a&gt; which is due to launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJTpjf"&gt;As well as lossless and hi-res streaming, code snippets also include mentions of “Dolby Audio” and “Dolby Atmos,” &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/16/lossless-audio-references-found-in-apple-music-web-app-as-company-teases-special-announcement/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The speculation is that the AirPods’ Spatial Audio features could be used in conjunction with Dolby’s surround sound technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAKwbk"&gt;Apple’s teaser doesn’t say when we should expect an official announcement, but some rumors suggest an announcement as early as Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdpd0a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy director’s Paralympics RPG is launching next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kVqUYWdXIIbeH2IwwvHMsjO8SQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297365/Rie_Ogura.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9sddg"&gt;The first project from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/em&gt; director Hajime Tabata’s new studio JP Games will finally be released next month, the company has announced. &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; is a mobile RPG themed around the Paralympic Games, and it’s the first video game ever to carry the official Paralympics license. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307399/pegasus-dream-tour-paralympics-game-hajime-tabata-2020"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; more than two years ago, but the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there’d been radio silence on the project ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOELvx"&gt;JP Games describes &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; as an “avatar RPG” set in Pegasus City. You can create a character based on a selfie from your phone, and train them in various para-sports. The game features illustrated versions of nine real-world para-athletes who compete in sports like javelin, athletics, and wheelchair basketball. Popular Japanese robot cat mascot Doraemon is also included as a guide to Pegasus City.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4bnldgiI3SheBdkRL0Rcz-HbVVY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519669/Rie_Ogura.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Badminton player Rie Ogura, who is featured in &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt;. The athletes are illustrated by Japanese artist Godtail.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="egel4u"&gt;The teaser trailer doesn’t give too much information away about how &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; will actually play, with very brief glimpses at the in-game action. The style and scope of the game appear to have changed quite a bit since its initial announcement, and Tabata suggests the Games’ delay altered the focus of the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oISx12"&gt;“The format of &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt;, which was originally planned to be a “Para-Sports RPG” was switched to that of an “Avatar RPG” in the wake of the global pandemic and the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Games,” Tabata says in a statement. “This is because I felt that the Tokyo Paralympics, which would be held after the postponement, could allow humanity to overcome their divisions and help bring our spirits together. No matter what the outcome of the Tokyo 2020 Games is, it is my wish that people everywhere will come and receive the positive energy that is abundant inside Pegasus City.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86ux3cd0xlWhOn5KKD3VaV_OHZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519667/PEGASUS_SS_02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G8EuoE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; will be available for iOS and Android on June 24th. It’s a free download with in-app purchases; JP Games says some of the profits will go to the Agitos Foundation, an organization that helps people with disabilities get involved in sports. Pre-launch registration for the game will open today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWfcNW"&gt;Despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Apple will keep its mandatory mask policy in place at its US retail stores for the time being,&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-15/apple-stores-keep-mask-mandate-as-company-evaluates-measures?sref=10lNAhZ9"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company informed stores that it is continuing to evaluate COVID-19-related health and safety measures, but that the policy requiring customers and employees at its Apple stores would stay in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6U0Bt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;CDC announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that people who had been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus could do away with wearing masks indoors and outdoors, and did not have to continue social distancing. There are some exceptions to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;CDC guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends people continue masking on public transit, airplanes, and trains, and in health care settings such as a doctor’s office. Immunocompromised people are advised to consult their healthcare professional before discontinuing masks, and someone who develops new COVID-19 symptoms should start wearing masks again to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLw1dp"&gt;Some retail stores across the US &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/05/14/mask-mandate-stores-change-fully-vaccinated-cdc-no-masks-indoors/5102169001/"&gt;began lifting their mask requirements&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, with large companies including Walmart, Trader Joe’s, and Costco updating their policies. But Target and CVS were among the retailers who said they would keep their mask requirements in place as they assessed the CDC guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tza6u7"&gt;In its stores that have reopened— some are open on a limited basis — Apple currently requires customers and store employees to wear masks, and provides masks for customers that don’t have their own. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbrowse%2Fstore%2Fplan_your_visit&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F15%2F22437593%2Fapple-masks-retail-stores-covid-cdc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The company’s FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; also says it requires temperature checks before anyone is allowed to enter an Apple store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd1X63"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
