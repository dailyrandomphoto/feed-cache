    <title>Apple says it will send a witness to Senate hearing on app stores after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxvfy5MYV2A2o2l-kYDwt8pylbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69109994/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjupRR"&gt;After several senators criticized the company, Apple said on Sunday it would send its chief compliance officer to an April 21st hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-11/apple-makes-top-executive-available-at-senate-app-store-hearing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday demanding that the company send a representative to the hearing, saying Apple was refusing to participate. &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter&lt;/a&gt;, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) ,and Mike Lee (R-UT) say Apple “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for the hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,” the senators wrote in the letter. “We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWbDfi"&gt;But on Sunday, it appears Apple sent a letter to the senators saying it was “surprised” by their letter and that it had intended to participate, but simply sought a change in the date. “We have a deep respect for your role and process on these matters,” the letter reads. The company will make Kyle Andeer— who Apple says has represented the company before the US House of Representatives and several states—available on April 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWqPC"&gt;“We look forward to sharing our perspective on our App Store,” the letter states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSug3"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday. Its App Store practices, including the 30 percent fees it charges developers, have been under scrutiny from lawmakers in recent months. Apple also has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;battling with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; publisher Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, which sued the iPhone maker for what it claims are violations of antitrust law. That trial is slated to get underway May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvbzcQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UDXOY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is shutting down its mobile Shopping app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkIEdBIgzWa_DEbdPRNDiZy3N68=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69109239/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0kWpia"&gt;Google is shutting down its mobile Shopping apps for both iOS and Android and directing users to its web Shopping site instead, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/google-shopping-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported. On Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-shopping-app-being-killed-off/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xda Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the term “sunset” had been added to several strings of code in the Shopping app, suggesting the apps were being discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxSVpZ"&gt;A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt; that the apps will continue to function through June. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Within the next few weeks, we’ll no longer be supporting the Shopping app. All of the functionality the app offered users is available on the Shopping tab,” the spokesperson said. We’ll continue building features within the Shopping tab and other Google surfaces, including the Google app.” The &lt;a href="http://shopping.google.com"&gt;shopping.google.com&lt;/a&gt; site will remain active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2C0bS3"&gt;The app allowed users to choose from among thousands of online stores and make purchases using their Google accounts. to quickly shop across thousands of stores and purchase stuff using your Google Account. This user found the Android app to be working normally on Sunday, but some users were already seeing a “something went wrong” message when they tried to use the Shopping app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic antitrust case versus Apple in Australia gets three-month stay </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGTM665yR__G3wga7bj27k3Pf-Y=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106057/apple_fortnite_1984_parody.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qF227E"&gt;An Australian judge has ruled that Epic’s lawsuit against Apple in Australia will be temporarily suspended as the two sides prepare for a trial in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/04/epic-vs-apple-australia-court-case-temporarily-suspended/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo Australia&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/03/apple-tried-to-kill-epics-australian-fortnite-lawsuit-this-week/"&gt;asked for a permanent stay&lt;/a&gt; of the case in Australia, arguing that the US and Australia cases were very similar, and that the matter should be settled in the original jurisdiction of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umZUrn"&gt;The two companies are fighting over Epic’s battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite, &lt;/em&gt;and the fees Apple charges&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; In August, Epic set up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;own in-game payments system,&lt;/a&gt; effectively circumventing Apple’s App Store payments and avoiding the 30 percent surcharge Apple collects on App Store purchases. Apple then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from its iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; for violating its rules. Epic fired back with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;antitrust lawsuit seeking to establish Apple’s App Store as a monopoly&lt;/a&gt; and tried to rally &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367924/watch-epic-nineteen-eighty-fortnite-short-apple-app-store-ban"&gt;protest video&lt;/a&gt; mocking Apple’s iconic “1984” ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6PyAm"&gt;In November, Epic filed a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-legal-proceedings-against-google-in-australia"&gt;similar legal claim&lt;/a&gt; against Apple in Australia, saying the iPhone maker’s conduct was “unconscionable, and breaches the Australian Consumer Law as well as various sections of the Competition and Consumer Act [of] 2010.” Epic has also filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323100/epic-google-australia-legal-claim-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;similar claims against Google&lt;/a&gt; and its mobile app store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLQHTl"&gt;Australian Judge Nye Perram ordered Friday that the case in that country be temporarily stayed for three months. He also said the proceedings will continue to be suspended in Australia if Epic continues to pursue its case in the US, but could bring the case back to Australian courts depending on the outcome in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clF5lN"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Apple and Epic filed proposed findings of fact documents&lt;/a&gt; for the US court case, which is set to open in California on May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnLt5y"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Saturday, an Epic spokesperson said the company “remained committed to our fight for increased competition on digital platforms in Australia and around the world,” adding that the company planned to “continue supporting the Australian government and regulators in their pursuit of fair competition in mobile app marketplaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Pnu3O"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SXbDJy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite vs. Apple and Google: everything you need to know about Epic’s mobile app stores fight","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="whZUWB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV4Ypo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: April 10th, 2:22PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Epic spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple refuses request to testify for Senate app store hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4ilqchlztE6YxiGVW2_jo2uWy8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103463/acastro_190322_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee leaders are demanding that Apple provide a witness for an upcoming hearing on app stores and digital competition after the iPhone manufacturer has refused to participate, according to a new letter to the company released Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imbRdT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter addressed&lt;/a&gt; to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) say the company “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for an April hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RT3z2o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8h7rdt"&gt;“Apple has been aware for weeks that the Subcommittee was planning a hearing on this topic and was engaged in discussions with our staff regarding who would testify on Apple’s behalf,” the senators wrote to Apple Friday. “Yet a little more than two weeks [16 days] before the planned hearing, Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness to testify at a hearing in April.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhNpZ6"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSug3"&gt;Apple’s App Store practices have been under intense scrutiny by lawmakers over the last year. In 2019, the House Judiciary Committee launched an investigation into competition in the tech industry, including Apple’s App Store. Throughout the probe, lawmakers homed in on the 30 percent fees Apple charges app developers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;interview last June&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman David Cicilline (D-RI) called the practice “highway robbery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvbzcQ"&gt;The criticism extends to the app developers themselves. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;publisher Epic Games sued Apple last year, accusing the company of violating US antitrust laws after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;removed the popular battle royale&lt;/a&gt; game from the App Store. The trial is set to begin on May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,” the senators wrote. “We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elx5N3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s big podcasting move is creating shows to promote TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WpownqYEXeHyOwgMrsJ06wAczEQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103100/VRG_ILLO_4520_Apple_Podcast_TV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mEJw9o"&gt;The podcasting world’s been waiting and watching for Apple to debut a full-blown revenue-producing podcast business. Spotify and other tech giants have been making moves in the space — signing exclusivity deals, acquiring companies, and generally trying to dominate the market. Yet, Apple has stayed mostly quiet, despite operating one of, if not the most, popular podcast apps on the market. Recently, however, it’s started to dabble in creating its own shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbGlxd"&gt;This week, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Foriginals%2Fthe-line%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F9%2F22375738%2Fapple-podcast-the-line-us-navy-spotify-original-shows" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;premiered&lt;/a&gt; a new investigative nonfiction podcast looking at US Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was charged with committing war crimes. The show, called &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;, serves as a complementary but separately reported program to a forthcoming Apple TV Plus show of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfOM7u"&gt;Anyone hoping this might signal Apple’s broader interest in building its own podcast content was likely disappointed. Although &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt; represents a step toward Apple creating its own shows, it doesn’t dive the company head-first into the podcasting waters. Instead, the company’s dipping its toes in, relying on podcasts to promote its subscription programming rather than using podcasts as a moneymaker themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2eQLJX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s original podcast endeavors serve as marketing for its other revenue-making businesses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqP0xb"&gt;Apple’s strategy continues to grow around these companion shows. Earlier this year, it premiered &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast to complement its TV show of the same name, and it created a companion show for the Oprah Book Club in partnership with Apple Books. It also plans to launch a show in coordination with the premiere of &lt;em&gt;The Problem With Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, another Apple TV Plus series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371914/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall"&gt;coming this fall&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of a full-throated proclamation that Apple wants to build a business around podcasting, we’re instead seeing Apple use audio to push podcast listeners toward its moneymaking subscription service TV Plus, as well as its a la carte book-selling app Books. Basically, Apple is playing it safe and avoiding a full commitment to podcasting, which, as of right now, doesn’t make it money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKbtwx"&gt;These companion podcasts instead serve as a marketing tool to capture potential audiences in new places. Maybe some dedicated podcast listeners missed Apple’s promotional push for &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;, but instead spotted the program in a show carousel on the main Apple Podcasts page. If they listen, they then might want to subscribe to TV Plus for &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;’s streaming premiere, and Apple gains a $4.99-per-month subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrZOfX"&gt;This doesn’t mean Apple won’t eventually build a way to make money off podcasting. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-podcasting-subscription-service-in-threat-to-spotify"&gt;been rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be getting into the podcast game more deeply and is reportedly working on a paid podcast feature. Currently, however, Apple doesn’t support any sort of revenue-producing functionality in its podcast app, like tipping, subscriptions, or exclusive content gating. For comparison, Spotify, Apple’s biggest player competitor, is testing subscription Anchor podcasts and offers a premium subscription tier. It also sells ads against its own podcasts and inserts additional ads into free users’ streams, giving the company a number of ways to profit off shows. Apple will likely never look to advertising as its main revenue driver for podcasting. The company’s taken a firm stance on user privacy, and targeting podcast ads would cross that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HeyMBX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting podcast listeners to subscribe to TV Plus could give Apple a user boost&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEJDGm"&gt;It could, however, start charging for podcast content or, instead of launching a podcast in coordination with an already created TV Plus show, use its original podcasts as a launching pad for future series. If a show does well as a podcast, Apple itself could greenlight the idea into a TV production, further driving revenue. This is already a podcasting business strategy. Shows like &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; started out as successful podcasts that were then turned into video programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFakrn"&gt;Other video streaming companies have pulled from a similar podcasting playbook. &lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/podcasts"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://netflixeditorial.com/channels/netflix-podcasts/"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; both create companion content for their shows, which not only encourages viewers to spend more time with the company’s programming, but also reaches a different audience, one that might be enticed to subscribe just because of what they heard on a podcast. The difference between those companies and Apple is their lack of podcasting infrastructure. They don’t have a player themselves, so there’s less opportunity to build a business around original shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rExaAP"&gt;Apple has multiple one-ups on these other streaming services. It already owns the space where a large portion of people listen to podcasts, and it offers a variety of content subscriptions for games, TV shows, fitness, and more, including a bundle. Building the technology to support paid podcasts is one of the last steps to structure the business — it’s that and believing podcasting could actually become a real revenue driver all on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung tries to woo iPhone users with a browser-based Galaxy test drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-tL5rT3tnAniP5hRb7OXfcVVG8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100721/DSCF0384_result.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s iTest site on an iPhone 12 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y70C9m"&gt;Samsung has released &lt;a href="https://www.itest.nz/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; to give iPhone users “a little taste of Samsung” from their mobile browser. When visited on an iPhone, the site prompts users to add it to their phone’s home screen, after which it turns into a shortcut to a simulated Samsung Galaxy device. The site appears to be the work of Samsung New Zealand, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/samsung-itest-galaxy-device-iphone-experience/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqyLej"&gt;The experience might be limited, but it’s a neatly designed bit of marketing. Open up the camera “app” and a video will automatically play featuring influencer Logan Dodds, who describes Samsung’s camera app features in the interface around him. Poke around the other “apps” in the home screen and Samsung happily markets its phone’s other features and accessories, while text messages and even a fake phone call outline others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8yqhwHjJNLmEPaYlw_596woOS5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431983/IMG_0574.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tooltip from the settings app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SoB9n6iGmuve8gHxjCxLgYflnkg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431982/IMG_0573.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are fake contacts in the message app to text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nCrW3d"&gt;There are also a couple of Easter eggs thrown in if you dig a little deeper. I particularly liked finding the “Friends with kids” contact in the text message app, who sends you garbled nonsense whenever you send them a message. Pry too much into the settings app and you’ll be shown a tooltip that reads, “We’ve simplified the settings menu experience, just so our developer could have a lunch break.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jgXzj"&gt;Samsung is targeting the experience squarely at iPhone users. Try to visit the site with another Android phone and you get a message that says, “You’re on Android already,” while if you try to visit using a desktop browser the site gives you a QR code to scan with your iPhone. Yes, it’s ultimately just a bit of marketing, but it’s more creative than most other smartphone ads out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRwl3z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says iMessage on Android ‘will hurt us more than help us’  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF0be5uHxP1MU1ILYSxxsJAbT9Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69099875/akrales_190513_3338_0008_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBZmZy"&gt;Apple knows that iMessage’s blue bubbles are a big barrier to people switching to Android, which is why the service has never appeared on Google’s mobile operating system. That’s according to depositions and emails from Apple employees, including some high-ranking executives, revealed in &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf"&gt;a court filing&lt;/a&gt; from Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;as part of its legal dispute&lt;/a&gt; with the iPhone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVNGvI"&gt;Epic argues that Apple consciously tries to lock customers into its ecosystem of devices, and that iMessage is one of the key services helping it to do so. It cites comments made by Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller to support its argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oKuZvO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Three questions that will decide Epic v. Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="32yjX7"&gt;“The #1 most difficult [reason] to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage ... iMessage amounts to serious lock-in,” was how one unnamed former Apple employee put it in an email in 2016, prompting Schiller to respond that, “moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tLvPQo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AWdybq"&gt;“iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” was Federighi’s concern according to the Epic filing. Although workarounds to using iMessage on Android have emerged over the years, none have been particularly convenient or reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pj5gKJ"&gt;According to Epic’s filing, citing Eddy Cue, Apple decided not to develop iMessage for Android as early as 2013, following the launch of the messaging service with iOS 5 in 2011. Cue admits that Apple “could have made a version on Android that worked with iOS” so that “users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly.” Evidently, such a version was never developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwsUJV"&gt;Along with iMessage, Epic cites a series of other Apple services that it argues contribute to lock-in. Notably, these include its video chat service FaceTime, which Steve Jobs announced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOxf9tEXEKQ"&gt;would be an open industry standard&lt;/a&gt; back at WWDC 2010. FaceTime subsequently released across iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but it’s not officially available for any non-Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS2O37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three questions that will decide Epic v. Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AU_82ZDjlEZqy_LndGkDcie7DE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096249/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;New filings show both sides’ legal strategies at work&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UzO5Bd"&gt;On May 3rd, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;publisher Epic Games will finally have its day in court, forcing Apple to defend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;kicking &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; last year. Epic’s antitrust lawsuit is bigger than a single game; it’s a direct challenge to the App Store model, the most significant legal challenge Apple has faced since the Xerox days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsUOSQ"&gt;Last night, &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/405/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/407/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;sides&lt;/a&gt; filed a document called a “proposed findings of fact,” essentially laying out every factual claim they’ll rely on in their arguments. The documents run more than 650 pages in total, giving a detailed roadmap of how each side sees the case — from the early days of the iPhone to Epic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493096/epic-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store-court-hearing"&gt;specific preparations for picking this fight with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. But the filings also bring the case into focus, raising three questions that will be central to the trial over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQYdC1"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Fortnite vs Apple: App Store Royale|78038" data-volume-uuid="e322ad1d6" data-volume-id="78038" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-289" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="VW8TJd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the exclusive App Store a necessary part of iOS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="SxoDNd"&gt;The heart of the case is the so-called App Store tax — a 30 percent surcharge Apple collects on purchases made through the App Store. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was kicked off the App Store for dodging that tax by installing its own payment system, which is forbidden under App Store rules. Now, Epic is making the case in court that the rules should never have been put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lRinUq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Legal monopolies and abuses of market power&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W88Sba"&gt;You often hear that this case is about whether the App Store is a monopoly — but Epic’s argument is more subtle than that, drawing on antitrust ideas around legal monopolies and abuses of market power. As Epic sees it, Apple’s monopoly over iOS is legal, but it’s using the market power from that monopoly to dominate the secondary market for app distribution. Epic compares the situation to Microsoft’s antitrust case in the ’90s: a legitimate monopoly over Windows, extended illegally to the secondary market in web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0MXLJ"&gt;It’s a good theory, but it only works if you see the App Store model as fundamentally separate from iOS. In its statement of facts, Apple describes the exclusive App Store as a fundamental part of the iPhone, part of the broader offering that makes the devices valuable. “Apple wanted to ensure that iOS devices were more protected from those malware and instability issues and quality issues that the PC world was used to,” Apple claims in its filing. App Store exclusivity is part of that, but so are security measures like the code-signing and hardware root-of-trust systems. On the software side, there is a range of private APIs and OS-level entitlements that are only enabled after App Store review, tying the systems that much tighter together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Jxu1g"&gt;Of course, it’s inconvenient for this argument that Google is offering a competing mobile operating system with none of these restrictions — to say nothing of Apple’s own macOS, which allows side loading. Clearly, it would be technically possible to allow competing app stores on iOS. The question is whether the court sees that as changing Apple’s business model or changing iOS itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NQj0UK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the iPhone different from a PlayStation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="n8lgwx"&gt;One of the biggest challenges for Epic is that the App Store model is fairly widespread. Consoles like Xbox and PlayStation operate on basically the same playbook, delivering games digitally through an open but curated digital store that’s locked to the hardware and controlled by the manufacturer. That alone doesn’t make it legal, but it adds credence to Apple’s claim that the App Store lockdown isn’t trapping consumers. If you don’t want to play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on an iPhone, you can play it on a console or a PC. Some devices come locked into a specific distribution channel and some don’t, giving users the chance to vote with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PlB1P2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Video game consoles operate under a radically different business model”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DPsUjD"&gt;Epic’s counter to this argument, as explained in the filing, is that “video game consoles operate under a radically different business model than smartphones.” Development for console games is slow and expensive work, and consoles are useless without a steady supply of those games, so console manufacturers are under immense pressure to attract developers. That means hardware itself is often sold at cost, leaving App Store commissions as the primary source of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXDPDw"&gt;Apple is different, Epic argues, because most of its profits still come from iPhone sales. “Developers do not participate in those profits,” the filing argues, “even though the availability of apps contributes greatly to the sale of devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rb70G5"&gt;On some level, this boils down to the argument that console companies are nicer to developers, so their platform power is less of an issue. The constant competition between Xbox and PlayStation gives game developers leverage to extract more favorable terms. But iOS and Android don’t compete for app developers in the same way, and the lower cost of mobile development means the competition happens on vastly different terms. Apple has given people lots of reasons to buy an iPhone, which means there’s less pressure on any given line of business. But that’s well short of the standard for monopoly power, and Apple ultimately comes away from the console comparison looking pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Ig69R4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much control can Apple exert over its hardware?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6ezXaY"&gt;Underneath everything else, Apple is facing a profound question of how much control it can exert over its own devices. For critics, this is Apple’s original sin, using industrial and graphic design to lure customers into a walled garden, then locking the gate. For fans, it’s Apple’s genius, integrating hardware and software to deliver a more purposeful and powerful user experience. But it all rests on Apple’s ability to maintain a closed stack, using hardware integration to control what happens in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMHW0v"&gt;This trial won’t undo that stack, but it could limit what Apple can do with it. The Epic Games fight started over payment processing, but the same legal standard could allow for alternative app stores or limit the restrictions Apple can place on rogue apps like Parler. It’s a first step toward setting regulatory limits on how tech companies operate, similar to the regulations on wireless carriers or banks. At its most basic level, Epic is arguing that Apple’s ecosystem has grown too big and too powerful for it to be run entirely out of Cupertino, and it’s time for it to be directly accountable to antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBIU20"&gt;Hundreds of pages in Apple’s filing are devoted to the benefits of that system for developers and iPhone owners, much of it undeniably true. There really is less malware on iOS devices because of Apple’s software controls, even if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;scam apps sometimes slip through&lt;/a&gt;. The system really does generate a lot of money for iOS developers, many of whom couldn’t compete outside of Apple’s walled garden. The shift to digital distribution really has saved money for developers who don’t need to distribute their product through brick-and-mortar retail anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wcd3uB"&gt;But in a sense, all of that is beside the point. Abuses of market power aren’t excused just because they’re sometimes helpful, and classical monopolies like Standard Oil or Bell Telephone had lots of side benefits, too. The bigger question is whether courts are ready to dive into the mobile software stack and start dictating the terms of how tech companies can set up their marketplaces. That’s a hard question, and it won’t be settled by a single ruling or a single case. But one way or another, it’s a question this court will have to take on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Global chip shortage hits iPad and MacBook production, says report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-mmOHzE302gzu7oYjA3qcwZvYk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093923/DSC01948.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LWGPCr"&gt;Apple has not been spared the effects of the ongoing global component shortage, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/MacBook-and-iPad-production-delayed-as-supply-crunch-hits-Apple"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The publication says that some production of MacBooks and iPads has been delayed, with “a portion of component orders” pushed back to the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORd6Hb"&gt;The issue with MacBooks is said to be related to the ability to mount certain components on circuit boards ahead of the device’s assembly. Delayed iPad production, meanwhile, is apparently because of a shortage of displays and display components. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/why-shortages-of-a-1-chip-sparked-crisis-in-the-global-economy"&gt;Bloomberg reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; on how the squeezed supply of display drivers is causing a bottleneck across the entire tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lgUF4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When will the global chip shortage end so you can finally buy a PS5?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Msa7vE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; didn’t state which MacBook or iPad models would be affected, nor whether the postponed production was for existing devices or yet-to-be-announced updates. Apple is widely expected to launch new versions of the iPad Pro this year, as well as continuing the transition to deploying its own processors across the entire Mac line. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/"&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; that a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Mini LED display would go into mass production this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O13ILA"&gt;iPhone production is said to be unaffected so far, though two sources described component supply as “quite tight.” Nikkei says the shortage “remains a supply chain issue for Apple and has not yet had an impact on product availability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzTFp3"&gt;Related: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chipolo’s new One Spot Bluetooth tracker beats Apple’s AirTags to the punch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIcKFONp23D8j1_YE8vMKmPyj4c=/7x0:1954x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091226/Apple_find_my_network_now_offers_new_third_party_finding_experiences_chipolo_040721_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nbliHC"&gt;The first Bluetooth tracker that can work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;Apple’s vast Find My Bluetooth network&lt;/a&gt; of iPhones, iPads, and Macs is here. But it’s not Apple’s long-anticipated AirTags tracker; it’s the &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/pages/chipolo-one-spot"&gt;Chipolo One Spot&lt;/a&gt;, an updated version of the company’s One tracker that’s designed to exclusively work with Apple’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLu17x"&gt;Chipolo calls the One Spot a “special edition” product. While it has the same 12-month battery life (with replaceable battery), 120dB ring, water resistance, and overall design as the regular One tracker, the One Spot &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works with Apple’s Find My network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9Di4LZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple officially starts letting your iPhone help find lost third-party products","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HscFen"&gt;That’s potentially an upgrade for anyone who already uses Apple products, given that a Bluetooth tracking tag is only as effective as the number of users who are on the same network. And while Chipolo has been around for a while, it’s still far smaller compared to more established players like Tile or the hundreds of millions of Apple devices around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bc0tl"&gt;The One Spot also features some Find My specific functionality, like a “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/use-lost-mode-mmfc0f0165/icloud"&gt;Lost Mode&lt;/a&gt;” that allows users to tag an item as missing — which will, in turn, notify other Find My users if it’s found with a short message and a phone number to help you get your stuff back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5j34u"&gt;It’s a sort of bewildering product, given the context of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;Apple’s rumored AirTags tracker&lt;/a&gt; that’s potentially going to be released later in 2021, and it would similarly be a Find My-exclusive Bluetooth tag for keeping track of lost or missing items. Chipolo’s tracker lacks the rumored Ultra-WideBand radio support that Apple’s tag will reportedly feature for more precise tracking, but that aside, it’s hard to imagine what else Apple’s tag will bring to the table that’s not already available on the One Spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLoWGI"&gt;Preorders for the Chipolo One Spot will start in May, with shipping planned for the beginning of June. No price has been announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;
