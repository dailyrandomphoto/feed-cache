    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;preorder one of the recently announced Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen more than its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tA5jd3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"},{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Right now, there aren’t deals available on the 38mm Series 3, which is only available for its standard price of $199 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJYnqufKYm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1161528/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-38mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101052%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtmnv%26DFA%3D71700000087521670%26CPNG%3DPLA_DVM%252B0064R00001AFOp3QAH-Apple_GoogleSearch_AO_Q4_FY21_AO%26adgroup%3DPLA_Apple%2BAirTag%26LID%3D700000001393753pgs%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9004339%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwtfqKBhBoEiwAZuesiJUi6dcVJIyvV2yp8_t07QEQXzMl8yEsT1GQ2bYjHatSoPfkIJXtHxoC6DAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. For that price, you might as well spring for the larger, 42mm configuration; both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LDCEnn"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version in white at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/1143052/9383?sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue%26%3D%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_zLjVYQ2UGxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkBXlQ2B1yfEVg0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DzLjVYQ2UGxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkBXlQ2B1yfEVg0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $275 — a minor $4 discount — or for full price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJYfu2GpGW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for the larger 44mm model with GPS, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38733&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-44mm%2Fprod25100056" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt; are offering it at a slight discount of $299, though, the latter is only exclusive to Sam’s Club members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="23GjQy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="rUGNYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. That said, the red and blue models are both seeing a steep discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, with both retailing for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm Series 6 is your fancy, it’s available in red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $379, slightly more than its best-ever price and evidence of the major discounts the red versions can sometimes see. Other colorways, including the pink (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1149510/9383?sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F683927568&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A9987250&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=9987250" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5SQ3MG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) and white models (&lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F351352991%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5V1YWL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;), are available for $415 at the same retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phil Lord and Chris Miller’s next project is a murder mystery for Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLhzBaN9EzPTC-Qn98sr5yr3GCU=/67x0:1795x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965572/Screen_Shot_2021_10_07_at_11.45.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0xCARw"&gt;Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the producers behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the writer-directors of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/10/5396322/the-lego-movie-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are bringing their talents to Apple TV Plus. &lt;em&gt;The Afterparty&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/10/apple-tv-reveals-first-look-teaser-of-highly-anticipated-murder-mystery-comedy-series-the-afterparty-ahead-of-january-2022-debut-on-apple-tv/"&gt;a new eight-part murder-mystery comedy series&lt;/a&gt; created and directed by Miller, with both Lord and Miller serving as showrunners and executive producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OIwlr"&gt;The new series “centers on a murder mystery at a high school reunion,” Apple says, with each episode featuring “a retelling of the same night told through a different character’s perspective, each with its own unique visual style and film genre to match the teller’s personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IBgSf"&gt;The show stars Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, Ben Schwartz, and Ilana Glazer, among several other comedy stars (and apparently Dave Franco). It’s hard to get a real sense of the details of the plot based off this first trailer (Haddish is investigating the murder?), but the premise and cast are certainly promising. Plus, stories with equally vague premises — &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; starts as &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/game-night-review.html"&gt;a movie about people playing board games&lt;/a&gt; before it gets wacky — have historically allowed for plenty of shocking twists and humorous setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlutM4"&gt;Lord and Miller have another streaming project in the works as well. In February 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276330/hbo-max-clone-high-animated-series-season-2"&gt;HBO Max announced&lt;/a&gt; it was reviving Lord, Miller, and Bill Lawrence’s animated show &lt;em&gt;Clone High&lt;/em&gt; for the streaming service. Apple already has a successful working relationship with Lawrence, who’s a co-creator of its &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/09/emmys-2021-winners-full-list.html"&gt;Emmy-winning comedy &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25MU7v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afterparty &lt;/em&gt;will premiere globally on Apple TV Plus in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Epic v. Apple, a small developer is challenging Apple’s in-app payment system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UeFc9jFJLY4cnxUseni-LlaPZVE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965414/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdlTDs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671574/epic-apple-app-store-new-rules-meaning-ruling-decision"&gt;The ambiguous finish to the Epic v. Apple trial&lt;/a&gt; opened a tiny crack in Apple’s control over in-app payments on the iPhone — and now, a small developer is trying to crawl through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbM0H1"&gt;A company called Paddle &lt;a href="https://paddle.com/platform/in-app-purchase/"&gt;has announced its own in-app payment system&lt;/a&gt; that will take a smaller cut than Apple’s system — 5 to 10 percent, instead of the 15 to 30 percent cut claimed by Apple. It’s a way around the commission fees that started the fight with Epic in the first place and likely to be the beginning of a new fight for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90WU9S"&gt;Paddle’s system is designed to take advantage of the Epic v. Apple verdict, which required Apple to allow external payment links. Prior to the verdict, an App Store rule had banned “external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms” — but the judge found that rule violated anti-steering laws. Paddle’s system offers just such an external link, kicking users off to an outside page where they can pay before returning to the app. It definitely adds friction to the process, but it’s a far cry from the workarounds you’d have to go through if you wanted to skirt Apple’s IAP system today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwLH1X"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment as to whether apps using the system would be allowed on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7u271vGlnNzBu4fInAkQ__BuzgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907920/iap_demo_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Paddle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demo of what a Paddle “in-app purchase” would look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rgTiqz"&gt;One of Paddle’s biggest selling points is its fees — Apple famously takes a 30 percent cut (or a 15 percent cut &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150629/apple-small-business-program-app-store-reduced-commission-15-percent-developers"&gt;if you make less than $1 million on the App Store in a year&lt;/a&gt;) on in-app purchases for most developers. Paddle is offering a 10 percent cut on payments less than $10 and a 5 percent plus $0.50 charge on payments above $10. It’s not hard to see how switching from Apple’s payment system would be attractive for some developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdgWap"&gt;The real test will be seeing how apps that include Paddle’s payments fare during App Review. If Apple wants to find violations of its rules in apps using Paddle, it very likely will. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;company has said&lt;/a&gt; that it’s trying to figure out how it can change its rules to comply with the judge’s order, but so far, the new rules haven’t been made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCjjfm"&gt;Paddle told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an emailed statement that the company was waiting to see how the details of the ruling were implemented and that it’s built a few versions of its system to make it easier to adapt to whatever Apple’s rules end up being. It plans on launching its in-app payment service on December 7th, and the company’s CEO said that it “would welcome Apple’s view on this to bring more clarity.” Apple didn’t immediately respond to request for comment on Paddle’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPJs3q"&gt;You may also want to keep in mind the privacy implications of developers being able to communicate with users, as mentioned in the order — Paddle says that, unlike Apple, it’ll let developers see customers’ email addresses to help with billing support. While that comes with benefits (like developers &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/24/apple-in-app-refund-notification-changes/"&gt;actually getting to be involved in the refund process&lt;/a&gt;), you may want to keep in mind that you could be sharing your email address when you’re kicked over to a Paddle payment screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BzwNGG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will competition bring out the best in Apple, or will it prove the company right?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gmhwIy"&gt;Paddle also lists other benefits of its IAP platform, such as developers being able to price their app how they want without worrying if Apple will approve, the ability to set pricing on a country-by-country basis, and the ability to provide coupons. And, of course, the smaller cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYIXv0"&gt;With this being the first big challenge to Apple’s own IAP system since the ruling, it’s likely to attract a lot of attention (Epic CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1446117510919585796?s=20"&gt;is already tweeting about it&lt;/a&gt;). Part of what makes the proposition so exciting is that, until this point, the arguments for either side have been mostly theoretical. If a competing in-app purchase system really does start making it to apps, and it takes off, we’ll get to see whether the competition will make Apple’s service better, as some developers have argued, or if it will lead to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;even worse proliferation of scams&lt;/a&gt;, where developers charge $100 a year for a weather app, as Apple has implied. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple CarPlay could control more parts of your vehicle in the future</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Apple Carplay" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y085BJ1M-tw_P0wFLkprh9syRto=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963913/1344763803.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SlP45u"&gt;Ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/4/9258013/apple-car-play-review"&gt;since it was introduced in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, Apple CarPlay has represented a notable upgrade over the user interfaces most cars have by default, but many of our concerns about it, and Android Auto, come up due to their limitations.  Newer features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875604/apple-carplay-ios13-multiple-screen-no-support"&gt;dual-screen support&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17913786/google-maps-waze-apple-carplay-iphone-ios-12-review"&gt;third-party apps like Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; could help, but there are still huge parts of the driving experience that exist outside of Apple’s control panel. Now, Mark Gurman reports for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-07/apple-s-plan-for-cars-using-iphone-to-control-a-c-seats-radio?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s “IronHeart” push envisions tying settings like climate controls, seat positioning, and even specific surround sound tweaks to your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3YqJg"&gt;This is a gap that Google has closed by cutting deals with automakers like Polestar, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688309/honda-google-android-auto-assistant-driving-mode-gas"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; to use Android Automotive as the basis for their UI. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, while Apple’s plans would require carmaker participation, this isn’t a plan to provide the basis for an infotainment system like Android Automotive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hSJqwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The head of Android Auto on how Google will power the car of the near future","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196234/google-android-auto-in-car-systems-apple-carplay-interview"},{"title":"Driving the Polestar 2, the first electric car with a brain by Google","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qRrw1B"&gt;Instead, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggests it could resemble Apple’s smart home push with HomeKit, with an API that devices (in this case, cars) access with varying levels of support for control and sensor communication. One interesting wrinkle is the mention that with iOS 15, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/deprecated-sirikit-intent-domains"&gt;Apple removed several API features from SiriKit,&lt;/a&gt; making its occasionally disappointing assistant less capable than before. That includes controls that could, on compatible vehicles, manage these exact settings, like seat position, climate control, or audio source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zryatg"&gt;If the plans turn into real upgrades, that could mean different cars have different levels of feature support, with some using CarPlay to customize seat position, while others might not support that but could configure the vehicle’s A/C settings based on your iPhone preferences. As the report notes, so far, there has been limited support for things like manufacturer-provided CarPlay apps that can access these deeper control settings, and only BMW supports Apple CarKey so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMQj5D"&gt;So what does this mean for Apple’s not-so-secret Project Titan car program? &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the CarPlay expansions wouldn’t collect car or user data, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;whatever project Kevin Lynch is now leading&lt;/a&gt; will need to glean useful insights in another way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price and larger size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3YqqO"&gt;Updated versions of the AirPods were a no-show at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22663255/apple-event-iphone-13-live-stream-watch-start-time"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt; last month, but Apple did recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22477167"&gt;roll out a firmware update&lt;/a&gt; to bring Conversation Boost to the AirPods Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;An earlier software update&lt;/a&gt; also expanded the Find My integration on the AirPods Pro and Max, allowing you to locate your misplaced headphones if they come within Bluetooth range of another Apple device (whether it’s yours or someone else's).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOVS4I"&gt;The absence of the third generation of AirPods might be a little disappointing, but if you’re in the market for a pair of AirPods right now, you can still find regular discounts on all the latest models. There are often sizable sales on the second-gen base AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on the AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods with wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="KOD5bX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $109 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747976896193620917" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard second-gen AirPods, save for one thing: their case can be charged via the included Lightning cable or a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charger to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s PowerWave pad&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend saving more and opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $150 or below. Right now, you can get them for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=vergeairpodsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or $160 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747977841356115870#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747977841356115870" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;est Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above and offer noise cancellation. They also come with swappable silicone tips and support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content. They also recently received a firmware update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to as low as $170. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $179 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26%26adid%3D22222222227317608597%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D395477009936%26wl4%3Dpla-834433976587%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D520468661%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwr56IBhAvEiwA1fuqGoJTvXd60Wil7w2NpRvHJQwNPXUkWno3r0nNI2Z3XwNpX4tSWE601RoCuScQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $200 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1122332/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max have been discounted to under $450 at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Simply Mac in the past, there are currently few sales that deep to speak of. The best price right now comes from &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107530/1036?subId1=VergeAirpodsDeals100621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmgyl3ama.html%3Femailprice%3Dt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get a new pair of AirPods Max for $450. The Max are also currently available in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $489, which is their typical sale price.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJ7Qqt"&gt;Apple’s promised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;Conversation Boost feature&lt;/a&gt; that uses the AirPods Pro to make it easier to hear people’s voices is available now (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/06/airpods-pro-conversation-boost/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Macrumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Support for the new feature was included as part of the same update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;that made it easier to find AirPods Pro and AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; using the Find My app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4L5wQl"&gt;Conversation Boost is included as a Custom Transparency Mode in Apple’s headphone accommodations. When the feature is enabled, the beam-forming microphones on the AirPods Pro attempt to isolate voices above any background noise and other conversations. There’s also access to sliders to modify the amplification, transparency, and tone of what you hear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KR7KtQvfreXLEFfxOVnQ8E1bHw4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905796/Image__2_.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your AirPods Pro are running firmware 4A400, you can enable Conversation Boost as a Custom Transparency Mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tzbc1L"&gt;You can enable the feature for yourself using the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ggBD3h"&gt;Open Settings and tap on Accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HKK6v1"&gt;Tap Audio / Visual under the Hearing section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="czhfTI"&gt;Toggle Headphone Accommodations to on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oHxsXT"&gt;Tap Transparency Mode and toggle it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QljbqE"&gt;Scroll down to Conversation Boost and turn it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="9trmDg"&gt;Conversation Boost requires AirPods Pro running firmware “4A400.” Unfortunately there’s still no manual way to force an update on your AirPods, AirPods Pro, or AirPods Max, but you can check if you're already running the new firmware in the Settings app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rmgVpD"&gt;Tap General, then About.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SGw2Lh"&gt;Find and tap on the AirPods connected to your device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vX39vK"&gt;Check the firmware number next to the field labeled Firmware Version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="iIAh2t"&gt;Conversation Boost is just the latest accessibility feature Apple has added to its devices in the last year. Earlier in May, the company revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444137/apple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch"&gt;a slew of new updates&lt;/a&gt;, including the ability for the Apple Watch to accept muscle movements as an input method, and support for third-party eye-tracking devices on the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest iOS 15.1 beta includes iPhone 13 Pro camera features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro Max battery lasts a very, very long time. Screen-on time can clear 10 hours." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-NB9O_rvPPi4Q9hBeoDeXLd9Oow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69961155/akrales_210917_4760_0331.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1kpnMx"&gt;Two new iPhone 13 Pro camera features that Apple promised would be coming in future software updates have shown up in the latest developer beta of iOS 15.1. Now users can record video with Apple’s ProRes codec, and there’s a switch to turn off the automatic macro mode switching (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/06/iphone-13-auto-macro-ios-15-toggle-camera/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). With this &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15_1-release-notes"&gt;release of the third beta&lt;/a&gt;, users have gained access to the toggles, which could indicate that the features are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmlkIQ"&gt;In the current versions of iOS, the iPhone 13 Pro will automatically switch from the main camera to the ultrawide camera when it detects that you’re close up to a subject, enabling the close-focus macro mode. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Fop2oskTug8?t=343"&gt;Some reviewers&lt;/a&gt; found the switch (which happens without much of a UI indication) jarring, and Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/iphone-13-pro-macro-auto-camera-switching/"&gt;said it would add a setting to turn it off&lt;/a&gt;. Now that it’s shown up in the beta, though, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/q2ouj2/comment/hfmvsu2/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;some Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/q2ouj2/comment/hfmw3y8/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;have reported difficulty&lt;/a&gt; getting the same results with the Auto Macro setting turned off, even after manually switching to the ultrawide lens. Of course, with this being a developer beta, it’s possible the setting has some bugs or that it could work a bit differently by the final release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Y7LBX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Auto Macro setting may need some more polish&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ATjBuj"&gt;(If you’re looking for macro mode and have a non-Pro iPhone 13, or even an older model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711503/halide-iphone-13-pro-macro-mode-camera-app-update-older-devices"&gt;Halide has just released&lt;/a&gt; an update that includes a macro mode for the iPhone 8 and up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiHY74"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/06/ios-15-1-beta-3-features-native-prores-video-capture-for-iphone-13-pro-and-iphone-13-pro-max/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9To5Mac&lt;/em&gt; has a look&lt;/a&gt; at what using ProRes to shoot video is like in the new beta and reveals that Apple’s using &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202410"&gt;the 422 HQ flavor of ProRes&lt;/a&gt;. Like the macro feature, shooting in the color grading-friendly ProRes format is limited to iPhone 13 Pro models, with the 128GB phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;only recording the codec in 1080P&lt;/a&gt; instead of 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8kAsyl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS 15.1 could be a big release if everything from the beta makes it in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W8YzQy"&gt;While these features may show up in the official 15.1 release, that’s not a sure thing — SharePlay was in early versions of the iOS 15 beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;before being removed&lt;/a&gt; (though it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686897/ios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card"&gt;showed back up again&lt;/a&gt; with the first iOS 15.1 beta). The 15.1 beta also includes support for adding a COVID vaccination card to Apple Wallet, so if everything ends up making it in, this could be a pretty big release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgrENF"&gt;With its recent spate of updates and betas, Apple has been checking off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;a list of features that were announced but not yet released&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;released firmware enabling better Find My support&lt;/a&gt; for AirPods Pro and Max. While macOS Monterey and the impressive-looking Universal Control feature that comes with it are still missing, we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;already gotten the promised Safari redesign&lt;/a&gt; on older versions of the OS (unfortunately, perhaps).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select iPad models go on sale quite regularly.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPads are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the new entry-level iPad just introduced for 2021, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or the latest iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of sale happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. While the best deals of the year may be just around the corner with Black Friday and Cyber Monday, here is what is worth your consideration if you’re looking to make a purchase here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the recent iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-generation model of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model. The ones you can currently find in stock, such as at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJrISyuZP4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, are full price. Without any significant discounts, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has 64GB of storage instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with 256GB of storage for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Walmart is the only retailer currently discounting the new iPad, offering $30 off both Wi-Fi models. The &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F483978365&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadevergreendeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB model is currently available for $299&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F870975735&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadevergreendeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model is on sale for $449&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer extended this 10 percent discount even while the ninth-gen iPad was still on preorder, and it has remained fairly consistent in its availability. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664329-REG%2Fapple_mk2k3ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJr7KwG8AZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; all have the new iPad for its normal price at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 has the same 7.9-inch display and design as its previous iterations but with refreshed internal specs for its time. Just like the base iPad, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new iPad Mini was announced&lt;/a&gt; during Apple’s recent “California Streaming” event. The new Mini starts at a higher price point of $499, but unfortunately, the outgoing iPad Mini — with its older A12 Bionic processor — is a bit slim on the deals front right now. Most retailers that still have it are selling it at the full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model of the 2019 iPad Mini don’t always come around. We have seen the base 64GB recently drop to $299, but the only worthwhile deal to speak of right now is Walmart’s discount on the 256GB unit — it has that model for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-256GB%2F425274991&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadevergreendeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$449, saving you $100&lt;/a&gt;. That drops it lower than the starting price of the new iPad Mini, and it’s a full $200 less if you compare the old and new models on equal footing when it comes to storage. This could be a great opportunity for anyone who needs more storage or prefers the classic home button, Touch ID, or a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upjL8U"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fifth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen, top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has sadly forfeited its headphone jack in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7u8gdV"&gt;The 2021 iPad Mini just received one of its first notable discounts from Adorama, which is currently offering &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmk7r3lla.html%3Femailprice%3Dt&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadevergreendeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$25 off the base Wi-Fi model with 64GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;. This brings the price down to $474.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. We, of course, will keep an eye out for more deals on the new Mini, so be sure to keep checking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 39,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $539 — $60 off the list price — in all of its vibrant colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB, Wi-Fi-enabled version is also available for a $100 discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, with your choice of most colors marked down to $650. The one outlier is the green model, which has a more modestly discounted price of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Green%2F705887437%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$699&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in some configurations at Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB base storage is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1148110/2092?subId1=VergeiPadDeals080321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-silver%2F-%2FA-77616876" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $700 at Target&lt;/a&gt; — though you may have to pick it up at a brick-and-mortar location near you. The 256GB model is available for $800 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; in space gray. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $900 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Some similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo. The 256GB model is $949 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $1,000 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748082168808445595#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the 512GB model is $1,099 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; while the massive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; is $1,300&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-generation model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is making it easier to delete accounts attached to third-party apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QxUHuOO390QMUu-AQFuGQ-31_kw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960516/acastro_210831_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqpUG8"&gt;Apple will require developers that offer a way to create accounts in their apps to also offer a way to delete them, starting with app submissions on January 31st, 2022, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mdkbobfo"&gt;the company shared Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The account deletion requirement was originally announced alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;several other changes to Apple’s developer guidelines&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WWdtz"&gt;Account deletion is a minor convenience, but considering how often apps require accounts and how easy it is to delete an app without ending your relationship with the company connected to it, it’s welcome. Apple’s announcement suggests only that developers “allow users to initiate deletion of their account from within the app,” so it’s possible implementations of these account deletion features could bump you to a browser during some part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hb1xPI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Free yourself from third-party accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1HbSp"&gt;Apple has also &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j5uyprul"&gt;confirmed the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of its more prominent app reporting tool &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;that was spotted on iOS a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;. The company says the “Report a Problem” button is available on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and also macOS Monterey once it’s released. The button allows users to report scams or offensive, abusive, and illegal content — even for apps they haven’t purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IkTIs"&gt;Apple’s made other recent tweaks to the App Store — like allowing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700805/apple-app-store-built-in-ratings-reviews-stars"&gt;the company’s own apps to be reviewed&lt;/a&gt; — but for a full look at all of the changes the company has made to its storefront over time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;check out our article running them down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halide’s latest update brings the iPhone 13 Pro’s Macro Mode to older iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzUynfgZ0Yy2u-5dFqIZcRbXLGk=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959756/macro_mode_halide.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Halide&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFyEUx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide/id885697368"&gt;Halide&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best photography apps on the iPhone, and the company has just updated its app with a new macro feature, designed to perfectly complement the new macro mode that Apple added with this year’s iPhone 13 Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dlozy"&gt;But Halide’s 2.5 update doesn’t just add support for the iPhone 13 Pro’s existing macro feature that Apple made. It takes things a step further and adds a macro mode for older iPhones, too, using Apple’s Neural Engine for “AI-based detail enhancement,” which uses a neural network to squeeze extra detail out of the close-up shot, even when you crop in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iK9cub"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10792972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iAwKxX"&gt;The “official” macro mode on the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max uses the new ultra-wide lens that Apple offers on its more premium models, which — unlike the ultra-wide on the regular iPhone 13 models or older iPhones — add an auto-focus mode that makes the ultra-close up photography possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBeYID"&gt;Halide is mimicking that effect in two ways: first, it determines what camera lens on your device can focus the closest, and then the app offers “sub-millimeter” focus control to get the perfect shot. Then, it uses the aforementioned “Neural Macro” feature to upscale the image, allowing for sharp photos even when cropped in by 2x or 3x. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3O4TRY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not quite as good as the iPhone 13 Pro, but it’s a fun tool to try&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LgNRc"&gt;To use Macro Mode in Halide, you’ll first need to update your version of the app to Halide 2.5 from the App Store. Then, tap the “AF” button to toggle off autofocus, which brings up the manual focus menu, where you’ll be able to tap a new flower icon to enable Macro Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npllIL"&gt;I was able to briefly test out a beta of the new update on my iPhone 12 Pro, and the results are pretty impressive. It’s still not quite on the level of the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro capabilities — there are still limits to what the older hardware is physically capable of doing — but it’s certainly a better solution than simply holding your phone close to your subject and hoping for the best and a fun tool to play around with. And while I don’t have an iPhone 13 Pro handy to test with further, Halide says that its Macro Mode enhances that feature for even better macro shots, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15mnFcycsVzK9vyP6wWxBWm6vo4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905014/IMG_3350.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JLt87S-cxYVHjHLaYUFSHXL2a_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905015/IMG_3351.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macro Mode with Halide 2.5, shot on an iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9MbsQ"&gt;The new Macro Mode addition works on any iPhone that offers Apple’s Neural Engine (which includes the iPhone 8 and all subsequent releases) and is a free update for Halide owners. Halide itself can be downloaded for free from the App Store with a seven-day free trial and can be purchased for either $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year subscriptions or a flat $ 49.99-lifetime price upfront. &lt;/p&gt;
