    <title>New trailers: Succession, You, Nightmare Alley, Hawkeye, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hS2w7hodnxRlEtNpKzX5MPAOQ4=/0x0:1406x937/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69879850/kendall_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kendall Roy, smiling because he is happy Succession is returning soon (probably) | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevqiiYNFrc&amp;amp;t=1s&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBO" target="_blank"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KzOhz2"&gt;OK so the latest &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;spends almost the entire episode on Coach Beard in its most unusual, dream-like episode ever. I didn’t hate it (and I know it’s one of the two episodes added to the mix after &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-08-13/ted-lasso-christmas-episode-apple-tv"&gt;Apple said it wanted 12 episodes&lt;/a&gt; instead of the 10 the writers had already sketched out. The Christmas episode was the other), but I wish we had actually gotten to know Beard a little better. “I listen more than I talk” seems like a line that could be his mantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHLlsu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; is back and honestly the first episode seemed rushed to get certain characters to do specific things we as the audience know they must do in order to have a show at all. I’ll stick with it for a bit, remembering that this was a show that took a little while to find its groove in season 1, but the first offering felt a little more chaotic than usual. Billy Crudup keeps me coming back, to be honest; he makes Cory such a likeable weasel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pak65O"&gt;This week’s trailers include a dysfunctional family, a serial killer, a carnival charlatan, and a classic musical. Never let it be said that I don’t try to add some variety to these roundups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTLU6M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="49czGb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kevqiiYNFrc?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mnB2Vq"&gt;Succession&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6bZCgQ"&gt;The squirmiest show on streaming about awful rich people (yes even more awful than you, &lt;em&gt;White Lotus&lt;/em&gt;) is returning for a third season and the Roy family has never looked more dysfunctional. The fallout from the bombshell Kendall delivered in last season’s finale appears to be a central plot line as the Roys decide which side they’re on and how to keep the family business— toxic as it may be— from going under. Cousin Greg is as awkward as ever in this trailer as he informs Kendall he is the “number one trending topic ahead of tater tots.” And Logan is as angry as ever, shouting that he’s ready to go “full fucking beast.” God I missed this show. Adrien Brody, as a billionaire activist investor, and Alexander Skarsgard, as a tech founder and CEO, have joined the show for the upcoming season. Jeremy Strong, Brian Cox, Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin, Nicholas Braun, Matthew Macfadyen, and J. Smith Cameron return in the third season of &lt;em&gt;Succession, &lt;/em&gt;coming &lt;em&gt;to &lt;/em&gt;HBO Max October 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aVz2Dm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYb3B1ETlk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="E200u0"&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="skY9Ro"&gt;So I was not aware this would be a Christmas show but sure, let’s roll with it. &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; picks up after the events of the &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; movie, with Clint Barton just trying to enjoy the holidays in New York City with his family when he discovers there’s a new bow-wielding vigilante in town. The trailer has a decidedly jocular tone, which is kind of a new thing for this character. Jeremy Renner, Hailee Steinfeld, Vera Farmiga, Fra Fee, Tony Dalton, Zahn McClarnon, Brian d’Arcy James, and Alaqua Cox star in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus on November 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="evFJSI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAN1ThhTWsE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2aNCuJ"&gt;You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="j1A7lI"&gt;Netflix’s show about the serial killer/stalker next door who found his perfect match in season 2 returns for a third season, and Joe and Love are now parents which seems a little problematic? Joe of course has fixated on a new target for his obsession and Love is not super happy about it. Penn Badgley, Victoria Pedretti, and Saffron Burrows return for season 3, which adds Tati Gabrielle, Dylan Arnold, Shalita Grant, Travis Van Winkle, Scott Speedman, McManus, Shannon Chan-Kent, Ben Menhl, Chris O’Shea, and Christopher Sean to the cast. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; comes back to Netflix October 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fSuU7c"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-qVV8zyVmI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BHaGHG"&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LJw9vW"&gt;Based on the 1946 novel by William Lindsay Gresham, Nightmare Alley is not a supernatural film, director Guillermo del Toro said in an &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/09/nightmare-alley-guillermo-del-toro-awards-insider"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Given his body of work, it’s not a surprise people might make that assumption. The story revolves around a con man and former carnival worker who convinces people he can read minds. The all-star cast includes Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Toni Collette, Willem Dafoe, Richard Jenkins, Rooney Mara, Ron Perlman, and David Straithairn. &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qi7mJI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5GJLwWiYSg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eEUcRK"&gt;West Side Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Vu72Ar"&gt;We got a teaser for Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt; in May, but this is the first official trailer and I am a little perplexed that it focuses on the plot— of perhaps one of the most famous American movies based on a Shakespeare play which is itself very famous— instead of the songs? At least we get to see snippets of the dance numbers and some words of wisdom from Rita Moreno: Anita in the original 1961 film, who has a small role in this remake and served as a consultant to Spielberg. Ansel Elgort, Rachel Zegler, Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist, Josh Andres Rivera, Ana Isabelle, Corey Stoll, Brian d’Arcy James also star in &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zadoU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gBR4e1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmv92GzD0pY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EO2iMP"&gt;Bonus: Foundation first look trailer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sgY6Re"&gt;With less than a week to go before this massive series hits Apple TV Plus, we get a first-look trailer with commentary from stars Jared Harris, Leah Harvey, Lee Pace, and Lou Llobell, and writer David S. Goyer, who calls Foundation (the book) “the greatest science fiction work of all time.” Adapted from the Isaac Asimov books, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; drops its first episode on September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVqpRl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R1NTTq"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PNgDXB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save $800 on this 55-inch OLED TV at Best Buy this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgS4pyfvxQNptZIAgXccbWC55JA=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876143/153092_tv_review_sony_a8_4k_oled_tv_review_image1_bgco4tcqtp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Slim and sharp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FgcRHO"&gt;OLED TVs have developed a reputation for being sharp, clean, fragile, but also remarkably expensive. But this weekend you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfBzVgpkkUy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save a whopping $800 on this 55-inch OLED TV&lt;/a&gt; from Sony at Best Buy. At just 2.3-inches thick without its stand, the A8H, much like other OLED screens, is impossibly slim. This makes it ideal for wall mounting especially for anyone in pursuit of that ultra-clean, Ikea catalog aesthetic. In terms of apps, the A8H has access to the Android TV catalog and offers voice control via Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple AirPlay2. Besides having 4 HDMI ports that include a single audio return channel, the A8H also has a trio of USB ports and built-in Bluetooth for everything else.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5OkHSV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y3arKN"&gt;One of our biggest issues with the Razer Nommo Pro when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17898382/razer-nommo-pro-review-consumers-producers-thx-dolby-stereo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;originally reviewed it in 2018&lt;/a&gt; was the overall cost, but this sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nommo-Pro-Certified-Illuminated/dp/B07DNSLL24?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon knocks more than $100 off the original MSRP&lt;/a&gt;, making it a far more attractive prospect. This THX-certified speaker system is one of the best ways to beef up your desktop audio without investing in a dedicated receiver. The system itself is composed of a pair of standing woofers and tweeters, a volume control knob, and a trashcan-sized subwoofer that serves as the hub that connects to your desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JcsGWP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758930"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BIFgP6"&gt;It’s tough to say no to a good pair of Beats, and right now you can grab a pair of the Beats Solo 3 Wireless in select colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo3-Wireless-Ear-Headphones/dp/B07YVYPNRH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbeats-solo-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-79437096%3Fpreselect%3D79358892%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $131, their second-best price to date. The well-built headphones are compatible with Android and iOS devices and can last for up to 40 hours on a single charge before needing to be topped off via MicroUSB. They sound decent enough, too, and pair effortlessly with iOS devices thanks to Apple’s integrated W1 chip. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our review in 2016&lt;/a&gt; took some issue with the original sticker price of the Solo 3 Wireless, but this sale definitely makes the on-ear headphones far more appealing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dTwSmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9hjeuE"&gt;If your desktop or PS5 needs a little extra breathing room, right now you can grab the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsamsung-970-evo-plus-2tb%2Fp%2FN82E16820147744%3FItem%3DN82E16820147744" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung 970 EVO Plus (2TB) at Newegg for just $250&lt;/a&gt;. No bigger than a stick of gum, this SSD is one of the easiest ways to expand the storage outside of finally cleaning out your downloads folder.....the OTHER downloads folder. These drives can be easily installed on any motherboard with a free M.2 slot, and thanks to a recent firmware update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;your PS5 as well&lt;/a&gt;. Besides providing you with more storage space, the faster transfer speeds can help cut down on load times for games as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h3LG9e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5aDHQ"&gt;If you’re looking to substantially upgrade your home theatre and are okay with spending an equally substantial amount of money, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-HW-Q950A-11-1-4ch-Soundbar-Dolby/dp/B08X1CH646?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfBzRYNK7Tv#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have knocked $300 off the incredibly popular Samsung HW-Q950A Soundbar. We haven’t had a chance to test this ourselves, but a quick trip to Google will reveal a list of glowing reviews, from Wired, Reviewed, and Techradar to name a few. Even a cursory glance at this absolute lad of a soundbar reveals that that praise is well warranted. This soundbar includes 11 speakers as well as a pair of upward-firing rear speakers and a subwoofer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyT2OY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10759046"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ew12SD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>8 new HomeKit features arriving with Apple’s September 20th software updates  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFrB4RSo4qr_67XyNG51mEUjUcU=/0x400:2400x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874081/apple_wwdc21_watchos8_home_doorbell_06072021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sm4we8"&gt;With new iPhones come new features. And starting next week, Apple HomeKit users will get plenty courtesy of iOS 15, HomePod 15, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8 software updates. Apple has confirmed that these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;will all be available on the same day, September 20th&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k51FQ2"&gt;So, if you’ve been excited about unlimited HomeKit Secure Video cameras, the HomePod Mini as a speaker for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22672587/apple-tv-tvos-15-features-release-date"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;, or the chance to see your doorbell on your Apple Watch, you’re in luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vn6TDY"&gt;Here’s a look at all the new HomeKit and HomeKit-related features that will be dropping on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jo8NY2eGt7DG9iorfWFYTw-oYsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22025414/dseifert_201107_4281_0005.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new software update will let you pair a single or pair of HomePod Minis to your Apple TV 4K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6Won2G"&gt;Control your Apple TV with Siri on HomePod Mini&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="w9RK6D"&gt;Finally, you’ll be able to use Siri on your HomePod Mini to turn your Apple TV on and off, start a specific show or movie, or have it pause or resume playback for you. This has been a feature of Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant’s smart speakers for a while now (when paired with a Fire TV device or Chromecast), and we’re pleased to see Apple bringing Siri’s mini speaker up to par.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tFdFkO"&gt;Set your HomePod Mini as your Apple TV speaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxwnW"&gt;A single or pair of HomePod Minis can now be your Apple TV 4K’s default speaker. This feature was previously only available to the original (now discontinued) HomePod, but now it’s available for Apple’s more diminutive (and not discontinued) smart speaker. Additionally, the HomePod Mini can be the output for other audio devices using ARC / eARC, if your television has those inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxuJOq-o28fiEPHDe-8suVrAQzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541099/DSCF3862_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple TV 4K can now show you multiple HomeKit camera feeds on the biggest screen in your house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gUE4J2"&gt;Have your HomeKit cameras spot packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pLPGEg"&gt;Security cameras connected to Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video (Apple’s option for storing footage from your smart home cameras) through an Apple TV 4K or HomePod Mini can now tell you when they see a package. This is in addition to people, animal, and vehicle detection and will increase the usefulness of the two HKSV compatible residential doorbells currently on the market — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163585/logitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video"&gt;Logitech View&lt;/a&gt; and the Netatmo Smart Video Doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SRazyy"&gt;See multiple HomeKit cameras on your Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Im16Y5"&gt;The Apple TV can now stream multiple feeds from your HomeKit cameras instead of only one, so you can survey your domain from the big screen. It will also offer up control of nearby accessories such as a porch light, so you can turn on the lights using the remote,  no need to get your phone out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OMjPaC"&gt;Add unlimited HomeKit Secure Video cameras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oVMCFU"&gt;Speaking of multiple cameras, with the iOS15 update on your iPhone and iPad you can now add an unlimited number of cameras to HomeKit Secure Video if you sign up for the new iCloud Plus 2TB plan ($9.99 a month). Previously, 5 was the maximum number allowed, which is a bit limiting if you want to cover a whole home inside and out with cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrV3g8Rm4NYnw6didqLbXbN_KBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16308986/dseifert_190530_3460_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ecobee SmartThermostat is the first confirmed Siri-enabled accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sKsTIh"&gt;Talk to Siri in more places&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vqGlQF"&gt;The voice assistant is coming to other speaker-enabled HomeKit accessories. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features"&gt;Ecobee SmartThermostat&lt;/a&gt; is the only confirmed accessory so far — and the function won’t go live for a few more weeks, according to Ecobee. But it’s likely more devices will follow soon, enabling you to ask Siri to control smart home devices, set timers and alarms, and use the intercom feature in more rooms in your home. You will still need to have a HomePod Mini on the same network for the device to relay the requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AQaTqY"&gt;Tell Siri to do something later&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6VW0TX"&gt;Siri is getting smarter about home control, adding the ability for you to ask the voice assistant to do something later or based on an event. That means you’ll be able to use commands such as “Hey Siri, turn off the lights when I leave home,” or “Hey Siri, turn off the TV at 6 p.m.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vpr6RaUnkXF2S_If_9TwlUqEZrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858560/apple_wwdc21_watchos8_home_doorbell_06072021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new software update for Apple Watch lets you view your HomeKit doorbell camera feed on your watch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Enr29Y"&gt;Control your home on your wrist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zXy3Gj"&gt;With WatchOS 8, the Apple Home app gets a much-needed redesign. Now when you access individual accessories as well as HomeKit Scenes, the watch will use context to determine which ones to offer up for control. You can also now view HomeKit-enabled camera feeds from a doorbell camera directly on your wrist and use Intercom to quickly broadcast a message to the whole home, individual rooms, or personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wj04Cg"&gt;To update your HomePod and HomePod Mini’s software, go to the Home Settings in the Apple Home app (you can turn on automatic updates here). For Apple TV 4K, look in the settings menu on your device and for the Apple Watch, use the Watch app on your iPhone or the settings app on the watch itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPp7E6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:26AM ET, September 18th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that the article is referring to Siri on a HomePod Mini, not the discontinued HomePod, to control the Apple TV. Added the information that the HomePod Mini can also be the audio output for other devices through ARC / eArc. Clarified that the new feature for accessing accessories and Scenes on the Apple Watch is that the Home app offers up relevant accessories and Scenes using context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmail-1essHD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 8:26AM ET September 18th 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this article stated the update will let you view camera feeds on your watch and that you can unlock a door using HomeKit on AppleTV. You can already view video feeds on the Apple Watch, the update adds the ability to view feeds from a doorbell camera. You can only control secure accessories such as door locks through a personal device not through the Apple TV interface. We regret the errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDtToU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder Apple’s new iPad and iPad Mini</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJh377rgCk0xrZL9VTIMCiq3dLo=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857722/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ztdXBm"&gt;As expected, Apple’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;California Streaming&lt;/a&gt;” was loaded with a flurry of announcements, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also used its annual fall showcase to introduce its latest tablets, specifically the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;ninth-gen iPad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;all-new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is a follow-up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;2019 iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; that takes heavy design cues from last year’s iPad Air. The new models are set to launch on Friday, September 24th, starting at $329 and $499, respectively, and preorders have already gone live at several retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgwE0u"&gt;We’ll have reviews up for both models in the near future, however, if you’re looking to purchase Apple’s latest tablets ahead of release, you have a few options to consider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yMH3Z4"&gt;Where to buy the all-new iPad Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U3t2M7"&gt;Spec-wise, the new iPad Mini is a far cry from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3576178/apple-ipad-mini-review"&gt;original iPad Mini model&lt;/a&gt; and one of the bigger revamps to come to Apple’s smallest tablet since it made its debut in 2012. The sixth-gen model features slimmer bezels, an A15 Bionic chip, and a larger, 8.3-inch display. Like the iPad Air, the forthcoming tablet also ditches the aging home button, adds USB-C support, and incorporates a Touch ID sensor within the top-mounted power button. It also supports 5G and Wi-Fi 6, works with the second-gen Apple Pencil, and features a 12MP ultrawide camera on the front, allowing for the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt; Apple introduced with the iPad Pro last year. Additionally, like the ninth-gen iPad, it ships with iPadOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fECKGb"&gt;The latest iPad Mini comes in two different storage configurations, 64GB and 256GB, and in four colorways (purple, pink, starlight, and space gray). The 64GB configuration retails for $499 and the 256GB model for $649; both models are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91LXFP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FiPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Starlight%2F211557522&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664337-REG%2Fapple_mk7m3ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752240155828388288#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-64gb%2F-%2FA-84619867%3Fpreselect%3D77615852%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; with shipments expected to arrive before the tablet’s launch on Friday, September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rnMmYG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPad Mini doesn’t support mmWave 5G ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678389/apple-ipad-mini-no-mmwave-downclocked-a15"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="0DybVI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jyQB1V"&gt;Like the Wi-Fi model, the iPad Mini with cellular connectivity is available in two sizes: 64GB and 256GB. Both come in an array of colors — purple, pink, starlight, and space gray — with prices starting at $649 and $799, respectively. Both configurations are also available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9GM743/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-Mini-2021-Wi-Fi-Cellular-64GB-Space-Gray%2F664584591&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664343-REG%2Fapple_mk893ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752241079262357667#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-cellular%2F-%2FA-84619869%3Fpreselect%3D77615846%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lsq6xQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743742"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CBe2E6"&gt;Where to buy the new entry-level iPad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iZJ1f5"&gt;The entry-level iPad remains the most popular tablet in Apple’s lineup. The ninth-generation model keeps the same name the tablet has had since its introduction in 2010, but showcases several updates, including a new processor called the A13 Bionic, which is supposedly 20 percent faster than the outgoing model. Thanks to a 12MP camera on the front, the forthcoming device also supports Apple’s aforementioned Center Stage feature, however, the rest of the updates are more trivial. The new iPad still comes equipped with the same 10.2-inch display as before — this time with Apple’s True Tone technology — as well as a Lightning port, home button, and a single rear camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blvpwY"&gt;The new iPad comes in two different storage configurations, 64GB and 256GB, and in two colorways, silver and space gray. The 64GB configuration starts at $329 and the 256GB model for $479; both models are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-10-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F674982024&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664329-REG%2Fapple_mk2k3ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752241380893659528#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-10-2-inch-ipad-wi-fi%2F-%2FA-84619866%3Fpreselect%3D54184190%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments set to arrive before the tablet’s official launch on Friday, September 24th. Walmart is even &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F674982024&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently offering a $30 discount&lt;/a&gt; on the base model, bringing the final sale price down to just $299 for the 64GB, Wi-Fi configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XTmmmK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ8Eig"&gt;Like previous models, the ninth-gen iPad also comes in a cellular configuration, which is available in both 64GB and 256GB storage capacities in one of two colors (silver and space gray). Both storage configurations are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-10-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9GLLRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-Mini-2021-Wi-Fi-Cellular-64GB-Space-Gray%2F664584591&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664333-REG%2Fapple_mk663ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752241665105047552#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, with the 64GB variant retailing for $459 and the 256GB model for $609.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the new iPad Mini compares to the last-gen model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uNIGnSInoXv8c60SeRkas4LCdgg=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874379/lcimg_29dd1c6f_2141_4080_b52a_db12ce0673ef.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad Mini (2021) is the latest in Apple’s line of smaller tablets.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yVuL8X"&gt;With the announcement and impending release of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; and its revamped design, it might be all too easy to stan the new model and completely write off its predecessor. While the new model has a lot to offer — namely a larger screen, faster processor, refined design akin to the 2020 iPad Air, and a USB-C port — it also has a quality that is not so desirable: a higher introductory price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLobXP"&gt;The iPad Mini line has been notoriously discount-immune over the years, possibly because of its specialized position in the market and lack of competition. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;outgoing iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; only recently started receiving significant discounts, falling to $300 soon before the new model was announced, but it started at $399 from the get-go. The new iPad Mini starts at $499 before you add anything further, like extra storage or 5G connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoiSPN"&gt;So let’s go over what makes the new iPad Mini different, and if it merits the $200 price premium over its two-year-old predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kWTH6E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s iPhone 13 event: the 8 biggest announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNokVD5epfyoanYvxROAZ9oLPTc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850130/apple_event_2021_1046.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini for 2021 packs more screen and modern design in a diminutive size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fW1Guf"&gt;What’s improved on the 2021 iPad Mini?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tA9ela"&gt;The new iPad Mini has a bigger screen in a slightly smaller physical footprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n69sTd"&gt;Apple’s A15 Bionic processor replaces the aging A12 Bionic from 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A7O1mJ"&gt;The front camera has more resolution and supports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; to zoom in and keep you centered during video calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lYeJBw"&gt;The rear camera is higher resolution and can now record 4K video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gdxpod"&gt;USB-C all the things! (except iPhones, sadly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GEAZDV"&gt;No more Apple Pencil sticking out of the port to charge: second-gen Apple Pencil neatly attaches to the side to charge magnetically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SNPmtZ"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 compatibility &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GV0uQs"&gt;5G connection on cellular models for potentially faster speeds than LTE, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678389/apple-ipad-mini-no-mmwave-downclocked-a15"&gt;lacking mmWave 5G radio bands&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MNixNm"&gt;The showstopper for the new iPad Mini is its screen, now an 8.3-inch display. It may not sound like a massive difference compared to the 7.9-inch display on the 2019 model, but the new tablet is actually a touch shorter while squeezing in a larger screen. More screen real estate and smaller bezels in nearly the same footprint is generally a good thing that makes everyone happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUu690"&gt;As for processing power, the new iPad Mini features the same brand-new A15 Bionic chip you’ll find in the iPhone 13 lineup, with five GPU cores like the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max. (That’s one more than the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini.) Apple claims the new chip gives the Mini a maxi performance boost, with 40 percent CPU gains and 80 percent GPU gains over the older A12 Bionic in the outgoing model. There’s talk of it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678389/apple-ipad-mini-no-mmwave-downclocked-a15"&gt;not being clocked quite as fast as the A15 processor of the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, but that remains to be confirmed and the improvements over the previous iPad Mini are likely noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zB6GzP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The camera tech of the iPad Mini sounds like a solid upgrade on paper&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JLvnc"&gt; A 12MP ultrawide front camera replaces the 7MP selfie cam from 2019. More resolution on the front camera may not sound like the most important thing in the world, but the big appeal should be that the new iPad Mini supports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; for keeping you centered during video calls. The quality has also been improved — while still 1080p, it has improved dynamic range with more frame rate options for video and Smart HDR 3 for photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfaFFh"&gt;As for the rear camera, there are similar resolution and recording gains with a 12MP sensor and brighter f/1.8 aperture, replacing the prior 8MP @ f/2.4. The faster aperture should be helpful in low light, and for when it’s way too dark there’s now a quad-LED True Tone flash where the 2019 model had no flash at all. On the video side, the new model is the first in the iPad Mini line to offer 4K video recording at up to 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncuFA65v4fZQrYnuxxe0gdDFiPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850183/lcimg_90987419_14bd_47ba_b425_5984e2255904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini comes in four colorways: space gray, purple, pink, and starlight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d4ll3L"&gt;The latest iPad Mini now aligns with the iPad Pros and 2020 iPad Air by replacing the Lightning connector with USB-C. Apple spoke extensively of the flexibility that USB-C brings to the iPad Mini, even though for some reason the new iPhone doesn’t receive the same treatment. This offers more versatility for charging and connecting devices, such as full-size cameras or game controllers. You also get the faster 20-watt USB-C charger in the box, while even a $1,600 iPhone 13 Pro Max does not come with a charging brick at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H29froDJmJ7jGd02m_Yr6TsF07M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13358115/Apple_Pencil_Bad_Design.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This charging design is still bad, and it should feel bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YWVICT"&gt;The iPad Mini line became compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil in 2019, awkward charging method and all. With the new iPad Mini, you don’t need to leave it sticking out the side: it supports the newer second-gen Pencil, which can wirelessly charge while it magnetically docks to the tablet’s side rail. It’s a much more slick and seamless way of getting more functionality out of this little tablet. If you also want to add a keyboard to the mix, there are wireless Bluetooth options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxU9aM"&gt;Lastly, the cellular-equipped configurations of the new iPad Mini are 5G-compatible where the predecessor only has LTE. As for if 5G truly gets you faster speeds, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;you know the drill&lt;/a&gt;. But whether you achieve those faster speeds or not, having a mobile connection on such a portable device is convenient. A 5G iPad Mini (2021) will run you an additional $150, pushing the price to $649 (before carrier fees). Ouch. At least all 2021 iPad Mini configurations have Wi-Fi 6, allowing for faster speeds at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KHBfrZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="I8pkqR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758598"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GOxbwa"&gt;What’s the same on both models?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7ktDMN"&gt;While the new screen is larger, it has the same number of pixels per inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OjITJc"&gt;Both screens are laminated to minimize the gap between cover glass and screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zFOavb"&gt;Maximum brightness of 500 nits for both panels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j92pzj"&gt;Touch ID fingerprint sensors are present on both – just in different locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pdsk3o"&gt;Apple quotes the same battery life for both&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TYzAjL"&gt;Storage capacity still starts at 64GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZC10WG"&gt;Weight is practically identical (within 8 grams)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MvoelB"&gt;Both run iPadOS 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FU4YeT"&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the screen is the standout of the new model, but you should keep in mind that the pixel density is the same on both. The 2021 iPad Mini has a resolution of 2266 x 1488 and the 2019 iPad Mini has a 2048 x 1536 panel, which both translate to 326 ppi. So both screens should look equally sharp, though the 2021 model is giving you more screen real estate. Also, both screens are laminated, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;base-model iPad&lt;/a&gt;, so the pixels should look like they come right up to the cover glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHW3Zx"&gt;Another similarity is storage capacity. The new and old models both start with 64GB of storage and can be outfitted with 256GB for an additional $150. This might be a disappointment for some, especially given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675300/apple-64gb-iphone-13-128gb-standard-storage-space-photos-videos-apps"&gt;iPhone 13 models doubled their base storage to 128GB this year&lt;/a&gt;, though. You may want to do some personal bookkeeping and see how much storage you currently use before paying extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ijGU5leA7gYTi_720eLC0BfzSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850355/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini’s Touch ID sensor is now in the power button, opposite the volume buttons on the top rail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EwtSd2"&gt;What about software, though? Well, there’s not a whole lot to say. The new iPad Mini will ship with iPadOS 15, and the 2019 model will be eligible to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;upgrade on September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The only main difference between the two tablets is the new model’s reliance on more gesture-based controls, due to its removal of the home button that is still present on the 2019 model. Since the new model ditched the home button, its Touch ID fingerprint sensor is built into the sleep/power button on the top — which is also where the volume buttons are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="W8yhf2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The outgoing iPad Mini (2019) still has some merits in 2021, especially if you’re on a budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EGMMfc"&gt;Why might you stick with the 2019 iPad Mini?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fkPZxB"&gt;Price: the older iPad Mini is currently on sale for $200 less than the new model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VQfGg6"&gt;It’s still a fine tablet even today, with more years of updates to come&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xVvxRb"&gt;It has a headphone jack!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="T6FEN6"&gt;Classic home button operation for those who prefer it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="A4n2Uo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="986U7H"&gt;The outgoing iPad Mini still has more than a few great things going for it. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is frankly depressing to lose on the new model. All tablets — even mini ones — should have enough room for a headphone jack, but that’s a rant for another time. The 2019 iPad Mini also has the classic physical home button on its front, complete with Touch ID. The gesture controls of newer Apple products may not be for everyone, and there are still many who love the clicky home button. There’s no shame in picking up a 2019 iPad Mini in the year 2021 because you value these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQj2x3"&gt;After all that, there’s the consideration of pricing. Slightly aged tech always has the added benefit of discounted prices before they’re no longer available. With the jump in price of the new iPad Mini, a $200 price delta is nothing to balk at. The 2021 iPad Mini has priced itself nearly into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; territory, and there are good arguments to be made for why you should maybe consider the Air instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hjqxpv"&gt;But if you’re in the market for a small tablet, the choice is primarily between these old and new iPad Minis. Like I mentioned, there’s not much competition in this space, which is why discounts have not always been common. The outgoing model should still have years of updates in store for it, and there’s a wide ecosystem of compatible accessories — most likely also with cheaper prices attached to them. We’ll have a full review of the iPad Mini in the weeks to come, and we’ll see if its new features justify the higher price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How and where to replace your old, depleted iPhone battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0mWSVXrKcWvnqpLBF_jKjRUrh0=/0x27:620x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873726/F8M9LXDIM0THNI6.MEDIUM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Credit: Apple Fixer/ Instructables&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKJuw9"&gt;Your iPhone’s aging lithium-ion batteries will eventually start to lose their ability to retain a charge — and that can be highly frustrating, especially if you’re out and about all day. If that is happening to you, there are several solutions: you can switch over to the latest &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPhoneBattery091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, start carrying a battery charger around with you, or — simply replace the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OPFe7"&gt;To first identify whether your battery is ready for a change, you can check to see what the current health of your battery is by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Battery” &amp;gt; “Battery Health.” This is where you can find out your battery’s current maximum capacity. A small notice at the very top may appear if your iPhone’s battery is ready for a swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Battery” page in your iPhone’s settings has info about your battery usage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZBc9kffXfFCa7gpU87-JlyADATY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858291/IMG_FF5BFD69D52F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Battery” page in your iPhone’s settings has info about your battery usage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Battery Health” page will let you know if you need to replace your battery." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izwvsvS0OzJtaWGbzH0tQT9sZ8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858292/IMG_CB3733A4E40D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Battery Health” page will let you know if you need to replace your battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXkgXj"&gt;If you’ve decided to replace the battery, you have two choices: doing it yourself or hiring someone else — like Apple — to do it. Doing it yourself poses several risks — you void any remaining warranty, and you risk breaking your phone. But if you’d rather do it yourself, there are plenty of guides online, and the process is easier than you might imagine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lvRHsm"&gt;DIY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XajF1B"&gt;For those ready to take on this task, a good place to start is iFixit, which offers very in-depth explainers of how to proceed (for example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B11%2BBattery%2BReplacement%2F127450&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22679492%2Fiphone-apple-battery-replace-ifixit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here is one to use if you own an iPhone 11&lt;/a&gt;). There are also a variety of YouTube videos available that offer step-by-step instructions. The process involves unscrewing the back of the phone, mildly heating the lower edge of the phone, using suction cups to remove the display, and follow several steps to remove and replace the battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0TUywh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Feyqwf3cYtw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LK0fm"&gt;Before you start, you’ll need &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bonafide-HardwareTM-Repair-Driver-Pentalobe/dp/B00XZB3WKQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;smartphone repair tools&lt;/a&gt;, which can cost around $13 (iFixit strongly recommends you add a suction tool called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DottorPod-iSclack-Opening-Apple-iPhones/dp/B07HWLYVQN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iSclack&lt;/a&gt;). Some vendors on Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/IBESTWIN-Replacement-Adhesive-Instruction-Capacity/dp/B07QNXHPP1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even sell iPhone battery replacement kits&lt;/a&gt; for this very purpose, which can run around $25 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1mF24"&gt;Be aware that If you do choose to do it yourself and you have a water resistant phone, your phone will no longer be water resistant after you’ve opened it up. In addition, there’s a good chance that your OS will recognize that there is no longer an Apple-manufactured battery in your phone, which means you may get an occasional warning notice and the Battery Health app won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ulr3WR"&gt;Get Apple to do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dsoHLA"&gt;If you’d rather get someone else to replace the battery and not risk tampering with your device, Apple offers replacements under several conditions, according to&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-power"&gt; its website&lt;/a&gt;. If your iPhone is under warranty or you have AppleCare+ and Apple deems the battery defective, repairs are free. But if the problem is due to some other factor that isn’t covered by AppleCare+ — or if you’re not covered by that or by a warranty — you’ll have to pay a service fee of $49 for an iPhone SE (2nd gen) up to an iPhone 8 Plus, or a $69 fee for more recent models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0eR8A"&gt;You can either ship in your phone for repairs or head to an Apple store. A physical store repair could be completed in one visit or, in more complex cases, take up to three to five days, according to Apple. Shipping it in will take a bit longer, as you need to wait for Apple to send you a box to collect your iPhone. In addition, if your phone is out of warranty, there will be a $6.95 shipping fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIASV4"&gt;If Apple replaces your battery for you, the iPhone should continue to be water resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWVN4X"&gt;If all this doesn’t work for you, your timeline, or your budget, there may also be third-party vendors who offer repair services for iPhones in your local neighborhood. But their quality — and whether they use &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FAnswers%2FView%2F343117%2FWill%2BiPhone%2B7%2Bkeep%2Bit%2527s%2Bwater%2Bresistance%2Bafter%2Brepair&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22679492%2Fiphone-apple-battery-replace-ifixit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sealing adhesive&lt;/a&gt; to maintain water resistance — varies by vendor, so always check reviews and ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdiqei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 2021, 3:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on December 21st, 2017, and has been updated to account for service, device, and OS changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s seven-minute tour shows off what’s new in the iPhone 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAZdcCDnKArVTjMvX8yLXTCnTqw=/237x0:2643x1604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873250/Screen_Shot_2021_09_17_at_10.36.28_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KmGBoC"&gt;Apple released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72cAe_2LAFQ"&gt;a seven-and-a-half-minute video&lt;/a&gt; to act as a guided tour of the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro’s features, and to make the differences in the lineup clearer. In the clip, Apple also goes through some of the phone’s new video and camera features like cinematic mode, photographic styles, and macro photography, and emphasizes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;the phones’ increased battery life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqaxXR"&gt;The video doesn’t really give us any new info, but it does give us more (obviously very carefully crafted) footage of the iPhone 13 outside of a blank black or white background.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a good idea of what your fancy iPhone 13 Pros will look like covered in iced tea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0nvRcu"&gt;Also, the video has &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/72cAe_2LAFQ?t=218"&gt;a particularly funny scene&lt;/a&gt;, meant to show off the phone’s durability, where a skateboarder crashes and sets off a Three Stooges-esque cascade of accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone’s notch: should it stay or should it go?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcZ_XzHyPV5dqo1n_h3cEjgzt1A=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873052/Apple_iphone13_display_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="evzXav"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup&lt;/a&gt; comes with the biggest change Apple has made to the front of its iPhones since it first introduced Face ID with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review"&gt;iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;: that controversial notch has finally been shrunken down a bit. Apple says the new notch is about 20 percent smaller than the old one, although eagle-eyed observers have noticed it comes with the tradeoff of being a hair taller, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDtY9x"&gt;The new and improved notch is still a notch. A big notch, too, compared to the hole-punch cameras and teardrop cutouts that competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;like Samsung&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; have been offering on their flagship phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyF7Oh"&gt;Naturally, we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have some thoughts on the subject: is the notch worth it in 2021? Or does it need to go the way of the dinosaur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DHmSDR"&gt;
&lt;p id="egbcNs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve been using a notched iPhone since the iPhone X first launched, and I’m a notch apologist at this point. Compared to the bezel-heavy style that preceded it, it’s an obvious improvement; it’s hard to go back to the older iPhone SE style. And while a lot of Face ID-based features have turned out to be pretty gimmicky (looking at you, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16735822/animoji-karaoke-tutorial-iphone-x"&gt;Memoji and Animoji&lt;/a&gt;), the core functionality here is still really, really great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjhd3o"&gt;When it comes to unlocking a phone, Face ID just works, and it works well. And that’s largely because it does need all the tech that Apple fits in (including the various sensors, IR emitters, and the actual front-facing camera.) True, Android phones don’t have notches like the iPhone, but they also don’t have facial unlock systems that work nearly as well. And if a notch is the price to pay for convenience, it’s one I can accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYzWH0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean Hollister: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure, I admit Face ID is fantastic. It was the single greatest thing about switching from Android for me. I couldn’t believe how easy it was to log into my bank, check my medical records, or access and copy/paste my password manager’s passwords when I made an iPhone 12 Mini my daily driver last year. But that’s just as much a jab at Android as it is praise for the iPhone — because what I love is &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt;, which has nothing to do with my face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bUtXY5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Speed has nothing to do with my face&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5pcCm8"&gt;Why hasn’t Android standardized on an excellent, fast fingerprint sensor, one placed precisely where I leave my digits anyhow? Why did Apple always insist on fitting it into the bottom bezel of its phones where I’d have to awkwardly stretch down? Why not mount a fingerprint-reading camera in that iPhone logo Apple always loves to leave on the back of its phones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaXHjl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: A rear fingerprint reader would mess with Apple’s easily shattered lovely looking slab of glass on the back, though. If the company can nail an under-glass fingerprint reader, they’re better off just sticking one on the front of the phone under the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yWEGO"&gt;The one thing I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; see an argument for is bringing back Touch ID, integrated into the power button (like on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; and the recent iPad Air.) But even if you were to do that, Apple would still have to find somewhere to put the front-facing camera. Hiding it away in the bezels won’t work on an iPhone; there’s just simply nowhere to put it. And choosing between a small notch with less functionality and a marginally larger one with more, Face ID is an easy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ijGU5leA7gYTi_720eLC0BfzSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850355/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini, with Touch ID.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G7Lcr6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;They could put it where everyone else puts it these days: a tiny hole instead of a giant notch. Or how about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;those under-display selfie cameras&lt;/a&gt; we’ve heard so much about? Speaking of which, what keeps Apple from giving us an under-display fingerprint sensor, or sticking the guts of Face ID into the hole in a hole-punch display, too? I’m not saying the notch bugs me every single time I look at the screen (OLED works wonders), but surely you don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a notch just to fit a couple of fancy IR blasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEfHpg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: Right now it sounds like under-display cameras are still a bit more trouble then they’re worth; assuming Apple gets on board with that, it’d imagine it’ll still be some time before the tech catches up to the idea of what it could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urqYJH"&gt;But even if they were, there’s a lot more to Face ID than just a couple of fancy IR blasters. Remember this slide from when Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16288806/apple-iphone-x-price-release-date-features-announced"&gt;announced the iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S569GXo7aLn-mHvKIdf_Gxq4JRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9230639/apple_iphone_2017_20170912_11726.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s inside the iPhone’s notch, circa iPhone X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2OZw3Z"&gt;That seems like it’d be more difficult to cram into a hole punch cutout — even if Apple was willing to go with a larger one, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus&lt;/a&gt;’ double-camera cutout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm3AMN"&gt;Of course, the biggest argument in favor of bringing a fingerprint reader back is the stark reality of 2020 and 2021: the fact that we’re all wearing masks all the time, and that Face ID, frankly, is terrible when you’re wearing a mask. But hopefully that issue will improve if (when?) the pandemic starts to ebb, and I can go back to easily unlocking my phone when I’m out and about again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjmFnE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;Hey! I was saving that argument for later. Cutting me off at the pass is a dirty trick. So do you agree that speed matters more than the fact that Face ID uses your face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yy2nuA"&gt;Okay, let’s pretend for a moment that Face ID actually requires a linear array of components (even though the speaker, microphone, ambient light sensor and proximity sensor in that image all feature in standard phones and almost all of them could easily be placed on a phone’s rim). What’s so wrong about giving a phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;a little bit of forehead&lt;/a&gt; instead of a notch, like the Pixel 4’s Face ID competitor? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BLIvC7sjrH7T4cLd3x1x_ZujPOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19302260/vpavic_191016_3730_0082.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 4 stuck its sensors inside its forehead instead of a notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RjrFbf"&gt;Stick some extra battery underneath the additional height that change would afford — or hell, how about a good ol’ headphone jack. Design certainly isn’t the reason that particular Pixel failed; it was panned for lackluster battery life and gimmicks, and probably didn’t have anywhere near &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;enough marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cSc6d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: I mean, design may have had something to do with it, but the Pixel 4 helps prove my point: Google was cramming way more tech than even Face ID had for the sake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/30/21496318/google-soli-radar-motion-sense-rick-osterloh-pixel-5"&gt;gimmicky Soli gestures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="letRMx"&gt;And taking up the whole top of the phone for a camera array feels like a worse situation than the notch; at least with the notch, you can still nominally use the top area of the phone as a status bar thanks to the “rabbit ears” of screens on the side (something that previous versions of iOS had to devote useful pixel space for.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Llo3e"&gt;There’s also the chance that Apple could one day add Touch ID back to the iPhone, either in button or in-display form. But even if it does, it’s hard for me to imagine the company backtracking from Face ID at this point. Which means that like it or not, Sean, you’ll probably have to suffer a notch for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HGlMWK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;I guess I kinda like the rabbit ears. But suffer, I will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8pXeN7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Let's make it a poll: is it time for Apple to ditch the notch? Should it stay or should it go?&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1438928347635937280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook tells Apple employees he’s ‘looking forward to moving forward’ after Epic ruling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iq80HEV7RCR4gvDyHj2oHqRVItE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873004/1233030828.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ipmKjv"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that he was “looking forward to moving forward” after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;a verdict in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; antitrust case&lt;/a&gt;. In an all-hands meeting with employees, Cook echoed the line Apple has taken publicly on the case, celebrating the company’s legal wins and downplaying its loss on an unfair competition claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngNyVt"&gt;“If you sort of back up and remember what the App Store is about, the App Store was built to be a trusted place for users so they could go explore and discover apps. It was meant to be a great business opportunity for developers,” Cook told employees, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Epic came along and wanted basically to be handled in a special way. Our rules are that we treat everyone the same. They ask us repeatedly to treat them different, we said no, and they sued us on 10 different items. The court ruled nine of those in favor of Apple and one in favor of Epic. Most importantly, they ruled that Apple is not a monopoly, which we’ve always known. Apple is in a fiercely competitive market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CR0Kgk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There were one or two sentences scratched out of an agreement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2SQ7Fw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21396313/apple-fortnite-lawsuit-emails-app-store-ban-epic"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney asked Apple&lt;/a&gt; last year to let it include alternate payment methods in its iOS version of the game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. However, Sweeney said that Epic “hope[d] that Apple will also make these options equally available to all iOS developers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5yp2C"&gt;Contrary to Cook’s statement that “we treat everyone the same,” Apple has provided special treatment to a variety of app developers in the past. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;It offered Netflix a special deal&lt;/a&gt; where it took just a 15 percent cut of subscriptions sold inside the app, and weighed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;offering special perks to Netflix&lt;/a&gt; if the streaming video company would maintain support for in-app purchases. The company also carved out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;categories of apps&lt;/a&gt; that can bypass its commission for in-app purchases, and blocked or decided not to feature apps it seemingly feared might compete. You can see examples of special treatment for particular developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;in our collection of unearthed emails&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSMwHo"&gt;Cook is correct, however, that a California judge ruled Apple didn’t have a monopoly in digital gaming transactions — the relevant market in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;. The company successfully avoided Epic’s demands that it open up iOS to third-party app stores and sideloaded apps, and the court said Apple was justified in collecting a commission on digital goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OyR1Wk"&gt;Cook didn’t confirm whether Apple planned to appeal its one loss: the verdict that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;Apple’s anti-steering rules&lt;/a&gt; (which restrict developers from telling users about alternate payment options) violate California’s Unfair Competition Law. The ruling orders Apple to abandon the rules by December. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;Epic has indicated&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to appeal its own losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcz7gj"&gt;But like Apple spokespeople &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;have done publicly&lt;/a&gt;, Cook suggested he wasn’t overly worried. “I think the ruling will be very good to try to put some of the discussions to rest on the App Store. In terms of the one we lost, there were one or two sentences scratched out of an agreement, that was the extent of it. I’m sort of looking forward to moving forward now,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new COVID-19 policy requires vaccinations to skip ‘frequent’ testing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Requires Masks Be Worn At Most Stores After New CDC Recommendations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-eOaaDHh2M9uJIarcvYnMFdl4Bs=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872984/1331332668.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fu5aS6"&gt;Starting next month, Apple will “infrequently” test employees who come into its offices and stores for COVID-19, if they’re vaccinated. Unvaccinated employees will have to get frequent testing. Apple CEO Tim Cook and senior vice president of retail and people Deirdre O’Brien announced the new policy during an all-hands meeting today, according to an audio recording obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79oLQu"&gt;The company’s updated guidelines appear to line up with the OSHA standards that will be established as a result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666508/biden-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;the Biden administration’s push to increase vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;. Those standards say companies of 100 people or more must require either immunization or weekly testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG6Fmv"&gt;Apple recently pushed back the date when it expects employees to return to its office in response to a surge of cases and the Delta variant. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;internal email in August&lt;/a&gt; specified that the mandatory return is delayed until at least January 2022, and employees can expect a one-month notice ahead of time before it goes into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PaD0S"&gt;During the meeting, Cook told employees that “we need to learn” about a hybrid workplace after years of being entirely in the office and the last 18 months or so at home. For now, Apple will give everyone in the company three extra days off next quarter. For employees in the US, those days will come the week of Thanksgiving, while teams in other countries will set their dates independently.&lt;/p&gt;
