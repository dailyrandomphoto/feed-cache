    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest you can grab a pair right now is for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/apple-airpods-pro-mwp22am-a-in-the-ear-bluetooth-headset-white/product_24422954?storeId=10001&amp;amp;AID=10921729&amp;amp;PID=4485850&amp;amp;SID=fa73db569d2011eb83a05281c35caba30INT&amp;amp;cvosrc=affiliate.cj.4485850&amp;amp;cvo_campaign=Coupon&amp;amp;cm_mmc=CJ-_-4485850-_-4485850-_-10921729&amp;amp;CID=AFF%3A4485850%3A4485850%3A10921729&amp;amp;CJPIXEL=CJPIXEL&amp;amp;cjevent=faa926699d2011eb824c01890a82b82a&amp;amp;dclid=CO2H2dLk_e8CFcmnnwod0Y4CCQ&amp;amp;userEnv=&amp;amp;tenantId=StaplesDotCom&amp;amp;locale=en-US&amp;amp;zipCode=21638&amp;amp;channel=WEB&amp;amp;encode=" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199 at Staples&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to celebrate Earth Day 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Earth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OozVLmUOe7lHQnZ6AK-ktjzpbJ4=/51x0:1049x665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69135860/earth.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xiTnsQ"&gt;Let’s face it, it’s been a long and hard year for the denizens of our planet since Earth Day’s 50th anniversary in 2020. However, it’s possible that things are looking up somewhat. Although the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging in many parts of the world, we do have vaccines that may eventually get us past this. And in the meantime, the Biden administration in DC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375827/white-house-biden-budget-request-100-million-air-quality-monitor"&gt;is putting environmental programs in place&lt;/a&gt; that may get the US back on track. So perhaps it’s worth doing a little partying (and educating) on behalf of this year’s annual celebration of the environmental movement, which is set for April 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kYWwy"&gt;Once again, most Earth Day celebrations will be virtual. What follows is a sampling of some that you can attend. For a more complete list, or to find Earth Day celebrations in your area, you can &lt;a href="https://earthday.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8d15cc3da12d4338a109c7d64c97c02a"&gt;use Earthday.org’s online tool&lt;/a&gt; for both online and on-site events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OrXJWS"&gt;Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8QW6v9NDXzAPuCqgHRYw78zARY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444064/earth_day_2021.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Earthday.org&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d5NL8Q"&gt;Earthday.org’s second annual “&lt;a href="https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2021/"&gt;Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth&lt;/a&gt;” online live stream event will be broadcast on April 22nd beginning at noon, parallel to the Biden administration’s global climate summit (see below). It will feature a variety of celebrities, politicians, and activists from many fields. It will be preceded by two events: on April 20th, there will be a global youth summit, and on April 21st, a global education summit. To take part, &lt;a href="https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2021/"&gt;visit Earthday.org&lt;/a&gt; on the day of the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="d0a4eY"&gt;Leaders Summit on Climate&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leaders Summit on Climate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CK9POWpOWKMDlBfZR167D915AWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444074/leaders_summit_on_climate.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: US Dept. of State&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaders Summit on Climate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjXXK"&gt;President Biden has invited 40 world leaders to a &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/leaders-summit-on-climate/"&gt;Leaders Summit on Climate&lt;/a&gt; which will take place April 22nd and 23rd. On the agenda are weighty questions, including how to reduce emissions, achieve net-zero (offsetting or reducing carbon dioxide emissions), and protect populations from climate change. You’ll be able to watch via a live stream link which will be available closer to the date of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cXPtVd"&gt;American Climate Leadership Summit (ACLS 2021)&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="American Climate Leadership Summit " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aB6u8wc6Pps7TkoQsIHgbUYYFKs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444080/ACLS.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ACLS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Climate Leadership Summit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8IMN0w"&gt;Another alternative to the Leaders Summit on Climate is the &lt;a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/ed5af75f-48ab-434f-8666-2d1854f7789c/summary"&gt;American Climate Leadership Summit&lt;/a&gt;, an online gathering of environmental activists happening April 27th - 29th. Sessions will offer information on the current status of climate change, strategies for activism, and other topics. It costs $25 to attend a single forum, $50 to attend the main session and a single forum, and $75 for access to the entire program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P9PVFn"&gt;Join a virtual march and rally&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SC1.5NCE NOT SILENCE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVObHSr1QrLmk9ome-59oc8M1hE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444084/gather_promo_site.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SC1.5NCE NOT SILENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cbXshH"&gt;Two organizations, &lt;a href="http://www.earthdayinitiative.org/"&gt;Earth Day Initiative (EDI)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://marchforsciencenyc.com/"&gt;March for Science NYC&lt;/a&gt;, are collaborating to offer a series of online events culminating in a virtual march and rally using an online gaming platform. On Sunday, April 18th, from noon to 8PM ET, there will be an online event with speakers and presentations from politicians, artists, and activists such as Elizabeth Warren, Kyra Sedgwick, Rosdely Ciprian, and Marc Yaggi, exploring a variety of environmental issues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GaFom"&gt;On Monday, April 19th, the virtual march and rally, called “SC1.5NCE NOT SILENCE,” will take place in a 1990s-like virtual reality space created by &lt;a href="https://www.futuremeetspresent.com/"&gt;Future Meets Present&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gather.town/"&gt;Gather&lt;/a&gt;. Through an avatar, you will be able to visit booths, speak to exhibitors and other attendees, and, at 3PM ET, take part in a march and rally organized by March for Science NYC and &lt;a href="https://fridaysforfuture.org/"&gt;Fridays for Future&lt;/a&gt; (the movement co-founded by Greta Thunberg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga5lzp"&gt; You can attend by sending &lt;a href="http://www.earthdayinitiative.org/2021-events"&gt;an RSVP via the EDI site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Xtgzq2"&gt;Virtual 5K race&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual 5K race" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qja5DI8kyle1H2tgPqF9-PKSf_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444093/horizontal___park_feet___unsplash_jpg_1579715300_large.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtual 5K race&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PX5TwU"&gt;If you’re a runner or a walker, &lt;a href="https://secure.qgiv.com/event/2021weact5k/"&gt;WE ACT for Environmental Justice&lt;/a&gt; is holding a virtual 5K race, where participants will be encouraged to walk or run 5K during the week of Earth Day, April 17th through April 25th. So even if your normal exercise regime is a half-mile stroll, you can still take part. You can use the race to raise money for WE ACT — or not — but all registered participants are asked to donate either a set amount or an amount of their own choosing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fMNcty"&gt;Artivism for Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Artivism for Earth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z5Pvc3nJTLiknHH-69mWrz7Zwn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444097/activism_earth.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artivism for Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sTMBb6"&gt;The University of Utah is planning to present &lt;a href="https://artivism4earth.squarespace.com/"&gt;a series of online performance events&lt;/a&gt; on April 22nd, most taking place at the campus’ Natural History Museum of Utah. &lt;a href="https://artivism4earth.squarespace.com/schedule"&gt;The schedule will include&lt;/a&gt; a video mosaic, “four immersive performances, arranged under the classical elements: earth, air, water and fire,” a feature-length film exploring nature and humanity, a panel discussion, and a final program that features several different multimedia presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vf2kEI"&gt;The Year Earth Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Year Earth Changed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_Tawhj1muusEsmI75rYzDIedss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444101/apple_apple_tv_plus_earth_day_the_year_earth_changed_03292021_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gnf6gJ"&gt;If you’re a David Attenborough fan, you may want to catch his latest narrated special, &lt;em&gt;The Year Earth Changed&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary about how the global human lockdown affected the non-human inhabitants of Earth — often in a positive way. The film will debut on Apple TV Plus today, April 16th; you can watch the trailer &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XswV_yqPq28"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1UMvSZ"&gt;If you want to head into Earth Day with a party, join &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; on April 21st at 8:30PM ET for its Earth Day Eve 2021 virtual celebration, with performances by artists such as &lt;a href="http://www.kidjo.com/"&gt;Angélique Kidjo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://willienelson.com/"&gt;Willie Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.yo-yoma.com/"&gt;Yo-Yo Ma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.ziggymarley.com/"&gt;Ziggy Marley&lt;/a&gt;, and appearances by a number of environmental activists such as Dr. Jane Goodall.

    <title>Apple’s App Store hosted kiddie games with secret gambling dens inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0LZ9nJLSZ4OeSuHlIF-Xa1aNEo=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69134221/terrible_gambling_app.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2RhM0S"&gt;In popular culture, access to an illicit gambling den is as easy as stumbling into the right shop and saying the password — or greasing some palms. Apple’s App Store apparently has a real-life parallel: today, app developer Kosta Eleftheriou discovered a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; kiddie game that’s actually a front for gambling websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJWKDA"&gt;The secret password isn’t one you’d be likely to guess: you have to be in the right country —or pretend to be in the right country using a VPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtbSIV"&gt;But then, instead of launching an ugly monkey-flipping endless runner game filled with typos and bugs, the very same app launches a casino experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AjfMMO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; app pretends to be a silly platformer game for children 4+, but if I set my VPN to Turkey and relaunch it becomes an online casino that doesn’t even use Apple’s IAP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/crnOOF0pNi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/crnOOF0pNi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382750329972805633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqH4eB"&gt;The app, “&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1546731180"&gt;Jungle Runner 2k21&lt;/a&gt;,” has already disappeared from the App Store, presumably thanks to publicity from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-ios-game-secretly-turns-into-a-gambling-app-1846693222?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=gizmodo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/15/eleftheriou-turkish-casino-app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who each wrote about Eleftheriou’s finding earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHIgJH"&gt;It’s not the only one, though: the same developer, “Colin Malachi,” had another incredibly basic game on the App Store called “Magical Forest - Puzzle” that was also a front for gambling. I tried them both myself, and here’s some visual evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsE6EBjU55YPHvUqGouoXePJij0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22447520/gif_scam_apps.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UVzpHf"&gt;Here’s what Magical Forest looked like when you opened it from the United States:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JbJoJZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10449066"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X1sdmf"&gt;I accessed them from a VPN server in Turkey; While &lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball &lt;/em&gt;notes that users in other non-US countries like Italy also seem to have been able to access the gambling sites, I tried them with a number of other locations including Italy without success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmkf3F"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;the multi-million dollar App Store scams&lt;/a&gt; that Eleftheriou uncovered earlier this year, it’s not hard to see why Apple’s App Store review program might have missed these — they largely look like your typical shovelware if you don’t know the trick, with only a handful of tells... like the fact that Jungle Runner uses a Pastebin for its privacy policies:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WeQPxzwFu1dkZMM6kcelor3xFo8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22447552/pastebin_jungle_runner.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q46Ola"&gt;It’s not necessarily clear to me that they’d be violating very many of Apple’s App Store policies, either. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#gaming-gambling-and-lotteries"&gt;Gambling apps are permitted by Apple,&lt;/a&gt; as long as they’re geo-restricted to regions where that gambling is permitted by law, and you could maybe argue that’s exactly what this developer did by checking your IP address. But I imagine Cupertino would frown on a gambling app masquerading as a kid’s game either way — and Eleftheriou suggests the gambling sites may be scamming people out of money, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IlyJoT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As an icing on the cake, people in the reviews say that they deposited large sums for the promise of a bonus, but they never received the promised payouts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprising no one, the scammers aren’t even operating a fair casino.&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382750376978313226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JYkbVJ"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bplVAO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbKF23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVzh3I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYPFkP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mb2uTD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Spring Loaded event: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQfy_HJ-uLurWi5D4Bl4HGm8yKI=/34x0:1759x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69132951/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_8.22.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT on April 20th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="imUhUH"&gt;Spring has sprung and with it, the first Apple event of the year. The company successfully brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21552864/apple-event-macbook-arm-air-announcements-news-rumors-one-more-thing"&gt;custom Arm chips to its Macs&lt;/a&gt; last year, and now it’s continuing its product updates with an event called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22310826/apple-april-20th-event-date-rumors-ipad-pro-macbook-tv-airtags"&gt;Spring Loaded&lt;/a&gt;.” Outside the obvious coiled metal connotation, the name suggests another jam-packed day of announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2PTIT"&gt;And Apple does have a lot of products to address. The Apple TV was last updated in 2017 but is rumored to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;support for 120Hz displays&lt;/a&gt;, a new processor that could make it a more capable Apple Arcade machine, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a redesigned remote&lt;/a&gt;. The iPad mini is also expected to finally receive some love after sitting idle since 2019. Reports point to a larger display and updated internals for the small tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I22HdR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;New iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; will reportedly get a speed boost with a new chip similar to Apple’s M1, a Thunderbolt port for faster transfers and compatibility with more devices, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279247/apple-ipad-pro-2021-5g-qualcomm-mini-led-a14x"&gt;support for 5G&lt;/a&gt;. The larger 12.9-inch Pro may also be the first Apple device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;to feature a Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;a display and component shortage&lt;/a&gt; could limit how many tablets Apple is able to produce and sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvkD5I"&gt;There’s plenty of other hanging threads, too: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;the long-rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt; could show up, Apple may have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375738/apple-podcast-the-line-us-navy-spotify-original-shows"&gt;new podcast strategy&lt;/a&gt;, the Apple Pencil could get a redesign, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;new AirPods&lt;/a&gt; could make an appearance, the MacBook Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;might finally get its ports back&lt;/a&gt;, and there are always plenty of opportunities for surprises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlCEZQ"&gt;We’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here with everything Apple announces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4dgzK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches $200 million fund for climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izf-vlTMXN2F6fe7wIXn_FWU7_o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130995/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z0P1J5"&gt;Apple has created a $200 million fund to invest in forestry projects to help remove carbon from the atmosphere while also generating financial returns for its investors, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-and-partners-launch-first-ever-200-million-restore-fund%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F15%2F22385552%2Fapple-200-million-fund-climate-change-environment" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Restore Fund will invest in forest properties that are managed to increase carbon removal and produce timber. The goal is to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoAfi6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332461/apple-carbon-neutral-2030-climate-change"&gt;Apple said last year&lt;/a&gt; it wants to eliminate its contributions to climate change and become carbon neutral by 2030. The company says it will directly eliminate 75 percent of emissions from its supply chain and products by 2030, and the Restore Fund will help address the other 25 percent of its emissions. Apple’s partners in the Restore Fund include the nonprofit Conservation International and the Goldman Sachs group which will manage the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1o3BP"&gt;“Through creating a fund that generates both a financial return as well as real, and measurable carbon impacts, we aim to drive broader change in the future — encouraging investment in carbon removal around the globe,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives, said in a statement. “Our hope is that others share our goals and contribute their resources to support and protect critical ecosystems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vVCah"&gt;Apple said it will work with organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council and Verra to help determine the projects in which it will invest. The company didn’t say what the fund’s target returns would be but said it would “unlock the potential of this natural solutions by scaling it in a way that makes it attractive to businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bkv7Ds"&gt;There’s some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;controversy around the strategy of using forests&lt;/a&gt; as a way of offsetting greenhouse emissions. The World Economic Forum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;launched an initiative last year&lt;/a&gt; to plant a trillion trees to cut emissions. But its effort cited a study that &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6494/eabc8905"&gt;greatly overestimated&lt;/a&gt; the impact such an effort would have on the environment, researchers later found. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus adds new workouts designed specifically for pregnant, beginner, and older users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0c5dFFELiunEvEezdXUmUamDso=/59x0:1925x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130908/Apple_iphone12_apple_fitness_plus_workout_for_pregnancy_and_older_adults_and_beginners_041521.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1XnN9E"&gt;Apple is adding a variety of new workouts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;its $9.99-per-month Fitness Plus service&lt;/a&gt;, including programs designed specifically for beginners and workouts tailored for both pregnant and elderly users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mPJK6"&gt;“With more options for getting started, and staying active and healthy during pregnancy as well as at any age or fitness level, we hope even more people will be inspired to keep moving with our amazing team of passionate trainers,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of fitness technologies, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CcRSMS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Fitness Plus review: easy mode","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="til5wu"&gt;The new “Workouts for Pregnancy” program consists of 10 workouts across Apple’s strength, core, and mindful cooldown categories. Each workout is about 10 minutes long and designed specifically for pregnant users, with variations and suggestions for modifying the exercises as a pregnancy progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJglp0"&gt;“Workouts for Older Adults,” as the name implies, is a series of eight workouts meant for elderly users. The workouts are generally designed to use either light dumbbells or the user’s bodyweight and feature modifications to use chairs or walls to assist as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZP5AD"&gt;And for beginners who are new to working out (or starting again after a long break), Apple is adding new low-impact yoga, HIIT, and strength classes to help ease newcomers into fitness with basic exercises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOjr4S"&gt;Lastly, Apple Fitness Plus is also adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;new “Time to Walk” episode&lt;/a&gt;: an Earth Day-themed program featuring Jane Fonda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fT0ut9"&gt;The newly added Workouts for Pregnancy, Workouts for Older Adults, and Workouts for Beginners, as well as the new Jane Fonda Time to Walk episode, will be added to Apple Fitness Plus on Monday, April 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHLW1e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Peloton Bike Plus’ GymKit support no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCnBkghTitXn0Mle-7FbtFSOvSg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130830/akrales210108_4344_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZiuLwt"&gt;Peloton debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;Bike Plus&lt;/a&gt; with a much-desired feature: GymKit support. But now, the company’s pulling back some of that functionality. A Peloton spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today that GymKit no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes and instead will “only be available in cycling classes for now.” The spokesperson also said: “Peloton is committed to bringing the GymKit integration to all workouts and disciplines within Apple’s terms of service,” seemingly suggesting bootcamp workouts didn’t fall under those terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYdBuC"&gt;This change is a disruptive one for users who might have purchased the Bike Plus specifically for its GymKit support. It’s the first piece of hardware from the connected fitness company to support GymKit, and the direct Apple Watch integration makes tracking workouts easy, especially during Bike Bootcamp, which fuses cycling and strength exercises. Now, users will have to find a way to track these trickier workouts, like starting a cycling workout, ending it, switching to a strength-training workout, ending it, and so on. People can also try a cross-training workout, but that might not capture the entirety of the workout, either. When paired with the Apple Watch, the Bike Plus also displays users’ heart rates on the screen. This is also now gone from bootcamp classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfguh6"&gt;This is the reality Peloton users will have to deal with for the time being, at least until Apple starts supporting the bootcamp classes in its terms or Peloton figures something out on its end. I have a Bike Plus at home and use it with an Apple Watch, and I noticed the change immediately. It was upsetting! My output always seemed unusually high during bootcamp workouts, so it’s possible they weren’t accurate, but seeing my heart rate on the screen and having my workout automatically tracked was nice. I’m sad to see this functionality go, but I hope it might return in the future, albeit it with more accurate metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grab a 5G-ready OnePlus 8 for 50 percent off today at B&amp;H Photo</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYyAtE"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is once again offering the lowest price yet on the Verizon variant of the OnePlus 8. Originally priced at $800, you can &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615543-REG%2Foneplus_5011101036_8_5g_uw_smartphone.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get this model for $400&lt;/a&gt;. This phone typically costs more than the original OnePlus 8 model because it is compatible with Verizon’s mmWave network. However, because B&amp;amp;H is selling it as unlocked, it will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile networks if either is your preferred phone carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVbKLe"&gt;The OnePlus 8 includes a 6.5-inch OLED screen, a 90Hz refresh rate, and 128GB of storage. Despite its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, debuting a few weeks ago, at $400, this is still a great deal for people looking to upgrade to a 5G-ready smartphone and not spend a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8OcUxU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OdpAQR"&gt;Woot is once again offering the lowest price on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro. Normally $200, you can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-wireless-earbuds-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab a new pair for $165&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes free standard shipping if you have an Amazon Prime account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqNe2O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTx0D8"&gt;If you own an Apple Watch, or recently purchased one in 40mm or 44mm sizes and you are looking to buy a new strap, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-sport-loop-for-apple-watch-40-or-44-mm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Daily Steals&lt;/a&gt; is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers the opportunity to buy an Apple Watch Sport Loop in select colors for $18 when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEAPLEW&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This price also includes a one-year warranty through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AGuII"&gt;Keep in mind; these are Apple-branded Sport Loops, which normally cost $49, and not a third-party band. Daily Steals also has several colors that are no longer available on Apple’s direct website. Only two colors (“pride” and “red”) are available in the 40mm size, while the 44mm model has six colors in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="flaypa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386212"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qh5P8O"&gt;Speaking of good deals, if you are interested in picking up Vizio’s Elevate soundbar, which includes 18 speakers and support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fvizio-elevate-p514a-h6-5-1-4-bluetooth-soundbar-speaker&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F15%2F22384306%2Fone-plus-8-verizon-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-apple-watch-sports-loop-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots is still offering a deal on this product&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $1,000, you can get this rotating soundbar for only $779 when you enter code &lt;strong&gt;THEVERGEVIZ &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YmEzTp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733903"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XPULB"&gt;On March 31st, Nintendo pulled &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars &lt;/em&gt;from the Switch eShop, and physical copies are hard to find these days. But if you missed out on picking up this compilation, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737841581771625414#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-3D-All-Stars-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496596743%2F103673933&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals04152021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have physical copies of the game available for $50 — $10 off its original price. If you have yet to pick up a copy, now would &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; be a good time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AxMiKp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Adia Watts? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNu0R4whAse5SQ5_rsWmAoLTCBQ=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130498/awatts_20210405_4509_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Copy editing amid art&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="WvmhTI"&gt;If you’re not a writer or an editor, you may not appreciate how important copy editors are to publications. They are the ones who keep us from making fools of ourselves with bad grammar, bad spelling, or bad sentence structure; they also often act as fact-checkers. If you do a lot of reading on a variety of sites, you can usually tell which ones use copy editors and which ones do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNZeLb"&gt;Adia Watts is a copy editor for &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Like the rest of the staff, she is currently working from home, and we asked her to talk about her workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eh3oPV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yY8J8o"&gt;I make up one-half of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s copy desk. My official title is “video copy editor,” so I make sure our video captions, graphics, and titles are clean. That includes videos on our YouTube channels, social videos, and videos you may see playing on screens in malls (if you’re still going to the mall these days). But I also edit &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s social media copy as well as our daily articles, features, and any other words that may show up on our website. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is my first job out of college, so I’ve had the typical student jobs before this one, but I studied journalism in undergrad and have some experience with audio and video production as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBH8cw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8d5M8"&gt;I currently live at home with my mom, as many young millennials do these days. My bedroom has always had this small extra room attached to it. Before I came along, the room was my mom’s office, then a place to do my homework when I was a child, and most recently, it was just a miscellaneous storage space where we put things that didn’t have a rightful place. So once the pandemic hit and I was home all the time — working and taking classes — I decided to finally tackle this room and make it into something I enjoyed using. I’d already been working from home since 2018, but the added time inside made me really want a place to do work other than my bed or the dining room table. So I made it my summer renovation project to turn it into a home office for myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekle8G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcBJk2"&gt;It’s a hand-crank sit / stand desk from a company called Mount-It. (The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmount-it.com%2Fcollections%2Fsit-stand-desks%2Fproducts%2Fmount-it-sit-stand-desk-hand-crank-mi-7931&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22374271%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-adia-watts-copy-editor-tech" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;frame&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmount-it.com%2Fcollections%2Fsit-stand-desks%2Fproducts%2Fmount-it-table-top-for-sit-stand-desk-mi-7936&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22374271%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-adia-watts-copy-editor-tech" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;desktop&lt;/a&gt; were ordered separately.) I would have loved a motorized desk like the ones at Vox Media’s New York City office, but I don’t have many power outlets in this room, so I didn’t want to eliminate one by having something constantly plugged into it. Plus, when I do use it as a standing desk (which, admittedly, is rarely), the turning motion gives me a tiny workout. The desk is about 60 inches wide, and it can be adjusted to about four feet tall. It’s the perfect size for my height, and it has enough space for all of my computers, books, and various desk knickknacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fully desk chair" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sPoKylORHgmQ8Uxz1gnFbRjxMyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441520/awatts_20210405_4509_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fully desk chair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Under the desk: an ottoman and a wire drawer set" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lj0pX42AMqnAnmS7stQv7h1cn-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441519/awatts_20210405_4509_0034.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the desk: an ottoman and a wire drawer set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pCQZbd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a very interesting-looking desk chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9xHuu"&gt;It’s called the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeWhatsOnYourDesk041421&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Ffully-desk-chair.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fully Desk Chair&lt;/a&gt;. (Fully is the name of the company.) It’s very adjustable: the seat, arms, armrests, and back all move and slide in various directions. It also has a plastic sliding lumbar support in the back of the chair, but it really doesn’t stay in place that well. The seat cushion is comfortable, but overall, I find myself fidgeting and changing my sitting position a lot in this chair. I frequently lean to one side to rest on my elbows while I’m sitting, and I find that the armrests dig into my ribs when I do. I wish there were a way to push them down completely. I tried to find a used Herman Miller chair, but they were still very much out of my budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rxfn68"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see you use the space below your desk for storage. Is the cushion for your feet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Poo2tT"&gt;Yes! I am not a tall person, so when I adjust my desk and chair to the height I like, my feet just barely touch the floor. So I bought this &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1032164/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flory-pouf-textured-teal-green-opalhouse-8482%2F-%2FA-53038886"&gt;Lory pouf ottoman&lt;/a&gt; from Target to have a comfy stool where I can rest my feet. The &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2F3-drawer-closet-organizer-with-rustic-oak-finish-top-gray-metal-threshold-8482%2F-%2FA-50418749&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wire drawer set&lt;/a&gt; with all of my many charger cables, pens, pencils, crayons, etc. is also from Target. It’s actually in-closet storage for sweaters and other bulky clothes, but it was perfect for this room, so I couldn’t pass it up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tazxqz"&gt;
&lt;div id="PwUEVX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444797" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7OQnrW"&gt;
&lt;p id="qPLODb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your other tech: your computer, display setup, mic setup, and other tech stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwj6J2"&gt;I have two computers here: the 2017 13-inch MacBook Pro that was given to me when I started at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and my new (old) late-2012 21.5-inch iMac. I bought the iMac because I wanted something that would work well with my daily workload of Chrome tabs, Slack, and Spotify, as well as some Adobe software, without kicking up the fans or getting too hot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCwLCa"&gt;Despite working at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for three years, I am not tech-savvy, so I can’t tell you which spec on the iMac allows it to work so smoothly. But it has a 3.1GHz quad-core Intel Core i7-3770S, Nvidia GeForce GT 650MB 512GB, 8GB of 1,600MHz DDR3 RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. It works well so far, and I enjoy having such a large screen so I can easily look at multiple windows at once. Having a desktop also gives me a good excuse to get up in the morning and not work from my bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9DusS7"&gt;
&lt;div id="gZ1wVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444814" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oMbyfr"&gt;
&lt;p id="IdSuZY"&gt;Then there’s an Anker Ultra Compact Bluetooth keyboard. The key setup is almost identical to the keyboards on MacBooks, so it feels very familiar to my fingers. The key travel is a little deeper than the shallow clicks of the MacBook Pro, but otherwise, it gets the job done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCFvaD"&gt;My mouse is a standard &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737749377040692881" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M510 Logitech wireless mouse&lt;/a&gt; that I might have also picked up from Target. It has an extremely easy-to-lose USB adapter that slots into the USB-A port on my iMac, so it’s not Bluetooth. It has side buttons that sit next to my thumb for navigating through webpages, a scroll wheel, and rubber grips on either side. It’s very comfortable, convenient, and easy to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDCd80"&gt;I’ve got a Western Digital 1TB external hard drive that I’ve had since college that has yet to be filled up. Once my personal laptop (an early 2014 13-inch MacBook Air) began slowing down and threatening to give out on me, I started saving everything directly onto the hard drive. Now, I use it mostly to save my personal audio-visual projects that can comprise many storage-eating clips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Desk tech" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UNmYTA4-Y1bWxkHGhKJMtHAuM4g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441525/awatts_20210405_4509_0048.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Beats Solo Pro and an Anker keyboard" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PCCo5PWwjZTRmm4iaD7VhGpjAIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441517/awatts_20210405_4509_0026.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A desk of tech" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-s3_M8XCoyqNbUsGcjlHpZhYO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441524/awatts_20210405_4509_0047.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A desk of tech, including a Beats Solo Pro and a Sony Alpha A6000 camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="71PxnC"&gt;Speaking of audio: my headphones are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones-Listening/dp/B07YVYNM3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo Pro&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s picks for the best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. I use them while I work, along with a lofi hip-hop playlist, if outside noise gets to be too much. I actually don’t care for noise cancellation because I like to be aware of what’s going on around me, so I enjoy the Transparency Mode, which uses the Solo Pro’s built-in microphones to allow me to hear ambient sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWzds9"&gt;The microphone is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-Microphone-Textured-White/dp/B000EOPQ7E?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blue Snowball&lt;/a&gt; that I bought in college when I thought I wanted to be a podcaster. These days, I use it to record audio for TikTok videos in my free time. Like everyone else, I was sucked into the social video app at the beginning of the pandemic, and I use it to share visuals for poetry I’ve written.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEFDHe"&gt;The camera is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digitial-3-0-Inch-16-50mm/dp/B00I8BICB2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony Alpha A6000&lt;/a&gt;. I’m no photographer, but I like to take pictures, so I use it mostly when traveling or for special occasions. It currently has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F791322-REG%2FSony_SEL30M35_30mm_f_3_5_Wide_Angle_Lens.html%23donotlink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22374271%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-adia-watts-copy-editor-tech" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony 30mm macro lens&lt;/a&gt; on it that I bought when I thought I wanted to be a food blogger and take close-up pictures of delicious meals. Now, I just take pictures of food with my phone like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="P9a27G"&gt;
&lt;div id="mk6U68"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10436511" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NIYYsv"&gt;
&lt;p id="y7i4JI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see you have some interesting crafts on your desk, including a vase and — is that a candle or an incense holder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIWYOe"&gt;It’s actually a wax melter. A little tealight candle goes into the opening on the other side, and you can put a wax cube or even oils in the basin on top, and the scent fills the room. The vase that is holding my faux flowers and moisture meter for my plants is a handcrafted piece by an artist who goes by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/akilspots/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;akilspots on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. I picked it up last summer in Brooklyn at the going-away sale that he held before he moved to Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XGwNF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And there are also some really nice art objects on your corner bookcase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrNmla"&gt;Thanks! The bookcase used to be a set of drawers that I deconstructed and painted. The green triangle piece is just some scrap wood that I found around the house and decided to do something with. I tried to do a cool landscape scene, and I think it actually came out pretty nice. On top, I have a wood constellation plaque that my best friend bought me for my 25th birthday. It’s the Cancer constellation (because I’m a Cancer), and underneath, it says my name, my birthday, and some positive traits that Cancers share. Next to that is a zine from &lt;em&gt;CRWN Mag&lt;/em&gt;, a natural hair magazine tailored to Black women, which also happens to be where I did an internship in undergrad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3adXhl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You use the space on your walls particularly well. To begin with, you have some pretty impressive certificates. Can you tell us about them? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eytcig"&gt;Sure. There’s my diploma for my bachelor of science from SUNY Oneonta, a certificate for honors in mass communications, and an award from the Africana &amp;amp; Latinx Studies Department for my “courageous advocacy of equality and civil rights.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A deconstructed bookcase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A mirror, an award, and a photograph" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3RJvgpyiaAYKTp_XXwmsbM-Ky_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441522/awatts_20210405_4509_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mirror, an award, and a photograph.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zMhIEZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The art is lovely as well. I especially admire the photograph of the three hands. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gucaBL"&gt;Thank you! The photo of the hands is a piece by photographer Samuel Trotter. It was part of the Black in America archive from &lt;a href="https://seeinblack.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;See In Black&lt;/a&gt;, a collective of Black photographers uplifting and celebrating Black lives and Black art. The collective came together during all of the racial injustice and protests that were occurring last summer as a way to create community and a little positivity for Black people during a tremendously difficult time. Proceeds from the sales of the prints went to several activist organizations working to aid Black communities in America. To me, the hands represent coming together and the self-healing that happens within Black communities and family units whenever there is collective anguish like there was last summer, which continues to be an unfortunate reality in the Black American experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4nkgO"&gt;The Toni Morrison print is from an artist named Zoë Sinclair, who goes by &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeWhatsOnMyDesk041421&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FFrequencyOfLove" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Frequency of Love&lt;/a&gt; on Etsy. She has an entire collection of prints like these, featuring Black historical icons surrounded by colorful prints reminiscent of African fabrics like kente and Adinkra cloth. I chose Toni Morrison because, as a writer, her moving, descriptive stories inspire my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5VmAO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally, I see you have both a whiteboard and a corkboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhdFPC"&gt;Yes, I do. My corkboard usually features different mementos or reminders I need. Right now, I’ve pinned up a vision board that I made at the beginning of 2019, which is slowly but surely coming to fruition. My whiteboard is also for reminders or pieces of information that I need to know. It always contains my Wi-Fi password (which I’ve covered in the picture with markers) for guests and for myself because I can never remember it. But I also use the whiteboard for writing down new ideas that might come to me out of the blue. I once woke up from a nap and wrote the entire introduction paragraph to an essay on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Toni Morrison print by Zoë Sinclair (on the wall, left) and Medusa, the snake plant." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ONrM3KaWL0rK8DobaKIKO65hraI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445843/awatts_20210405_4509_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Toni Morrison print hangs on the wall at left, above Medusa the snake plant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Op62JE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks! Is there anything else interesting about your working space that we haven’t covered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bANQs2"&gt;I think that’s it. The only thing left to mention is my sad, dying snake plant. Her name is Medusa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KF490I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the FBI managed to get into the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubJSyKrsXz4QSd1LPgSAZ15x2Uc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69126966/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xXeuJq"&gt;The FBI partnered with an Australian security firm called Azimuth Security to gain access to an iPhone linked to the 2015 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack"&gt;San Bernardino shooting&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/14/azimuth-san-bernardino-apple-iphone-fbi/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals. Before now, the methods the FBI used to get into the iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11380204/fbi-iphone-attack-san-bernardino-secret"&gt;were kept secret&lt;/a&gt;. It was only clear that Apple wasn’t involved, as the company had refused to build a backdoor into the phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook"&gt;kicking off a legal battle&lt;/a&gt; that only ended after the FBI successfully hacked the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feKSaT"&gt;The phone at the center of the fight was seized after its owner, Syed Rizwan Farook, perpetrated an attack that killed 14 people. The FBI attempted to get into the phone but was unable to due to the iOS 9 feature that would erase the phone after a certain number of failed password attempts. Apple attempted to help the FBI in other ways but refused to build a passcode bypass system for the bureau, saying that such a backdoor would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/28/11321700/apple-responds-fbi-iphone-hack"&gt;permanently decrease the security of its phones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2g2ZL7"&gt;After the FBI announced that it had gained access to the phone, there were concerns that Apple’s security could have been deeply compromised. But according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, the exploit was simple: Azimuth basically found a way to guess the passcode as many times as it wanted without erasing the phone, allowing the bureau to get into the phone in a matter of hour&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ybmlH"&gt;The technical details of how the auto-erase feature was bypassed are fascinating. The actual hacking was reportedly done by two Azimuth employees who gained access to the phone by exploiting a vulnerability in an upstream software module written by Mozilla. That code was reportedly used by Apple in iPhones to enable the use of accessories with the Lightning port. Once the hackers gained initial access, they were able to chain together two more exploits, which gave them full control over the main processor, allowing them to run their own code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsFFRg"&gt;After they had this power, they were able to write and test software that guessed every passcode combination, ignoring any other systems that would lock out or erase the phone. The exploit chain, from Lightning port to processor control, was named Condor. As with many exploits, though, it didn’t last long. Mozilla reportedly fixed the Lightning port exploit a month or two later as part of a standard update, which was then adopted by the companies using the code, including Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyjrGn"&gt;In the end, not much happened as a result of the effort. The FBI &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11463672/apple-fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-contents-no-leads"&gt;reportedly didn’t get any useful information from the phone&lt;/a&gt;, and the bureau never got to set a legal precedent about whether the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/29/11325030/apple-fbi-iphone-hack-security-encryption-what-comes-next"&gt;could compel companies to compromise the security of their devices&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/1/16393074/apple-iphone-fbi-hacking-tool-san-bernardino-case-secret-court-order"&gt;a judge ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the FBI didn’t have to reveal how it had gotten into the iPhone, or who had helped it, due to concern that the mystery firm would face cybersecurity attacks as backlash for helping the FBI if its identity was made public.&lt;/p&gt;
