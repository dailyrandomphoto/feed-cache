    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P0NglS"&gt;Ulrich Kranz, a former BMW executive and the recently departed CEO and co-founder of EV startup Canoo, has been hired by Apple, the company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Kranz will &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/apple-hires-former-bmw-executive-for-its-rebooted-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; work on the Silicon Valley behemoth’s electric car under Doug Field, the former Tesla executive who runs the day-to-day operations of the project, which is codenamed “Project Titan.” News of Kranz joining Apple was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/apple-hires-former-bmw-executive-for-its-rebooted-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOm0Rh"&gt;Kranz was one of the executives who helped launch BMW’s all-electric i3 hatchback and hybrid i8 sports car. Shortly after he left the German automaker at the end of 2016, he and fellow BMW executive Stefan Krause were tapped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;to help turn around struggling EV startup Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt;. The pair clashed with Faraday Future’s founder, though, and in late 2017, they left and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17111026/evelozcity-stefan-krause-interview-electric-cars"&gt;formed what eventually became Canoo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aImjXg"&gt;Kranz, Krause, and a handful of other expats from BMW and other legacy automakers came up with an all-electric van that they planned to sell on a subscription basis only, which they revealed in 2019. The van was designed around a compact, modular platform that included the battery pack, the electric motors, and basically all of the vehicle’s electronics, which Canoo hoped to sell or license to other manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rEWORQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kranz was running Canoo when it held talks with Apple in 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="STsz7H"&gt;Canoo’s EV platform pitch was attractive enough that Apple held talks with the startup in early 2020, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;exclusively reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Talks between the two companies eventually broke down, though, as Canoo preferred to take an investment, while Apple was interested in an acquisition. Canoo also had an agreement with Hyundai to build vehicles based on the platform, but the startup has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;since walked away from that deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gix7J7"&gt;Kranz now finds himself near the top of a very large team inside Apple that is working on an electric, autonomous vehicle. Apple started the project in 2014, but it has gone through multiple revisions, with the company at one point focusing solely on developing autonomous technology. But over the last year, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/apple-s-aapl-tesla-tsla-killer-won-t-ship-for-at-least-half-a-decade?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;shifted back to trying to develop a vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and has reportedly held talks with multiple automakers as well as &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-apple-talks-with-catl-byd-over-battery-supplies-its-electric-car-2021-06-08/"&gt;battery companies like China’s CATL&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJDEog"&gt;Kranz was just one of a number of top executives who left Canoo over the last year. Krause, who was Canoo’s first CEO, departed last year. Canoo’s chief financial officer and its chief lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;also left this year&lt;/a&gt; following the startup’s merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Five of the original nine co-founders remain with the company, while those who’ve left have been replaced by people close to the company’s new CEO, Tony Aquila, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;took over after Canoo went public as a result of the SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGaVTr"&gt;Aquila has since pivoted Canoo away from the subscription model idea and is instead focused on creating commercial electric vehicles for small businesses. Aquila detailed the changes he was making to the company on Canoo’s first call with investors as a public company in March. Krause was not on that call, despite still being CEO at the time. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported late last year, Kranz’s contract with Canoo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;renegotiated as part of the SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dark Sky’s iOS app and website will shut down at the end of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H5XaFSmRqA3ewzz7I7q36VS-jdo=/8x0:877x579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434413/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_8.45.53_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Sky on the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBnzIy"&gt;Following Apple’s acquisition of popular weather app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;Dark Sky in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Dark Sky’s iOS app and website will be available until the end of 2022, co-founder Adam Grossman said in a Monday update to &lt;a href="https://blog.darksky.net/"&gt;Dark Sky’s blog&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/10/dark-sky-apple-acquisition-shutdown-date/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAX1EV"&gt;The update about the 2022 shutdown hit the same day that Apple announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22527878%2Fdark-sky-apple-ios-app-website-api-shut-down-end-of-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new weather features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; as part of its WWDC keynote presentation. The stock Weather app is getting a new design, full-screen weather maps, next-hour precipitation notifications, and even new animated backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWhDEQ"&gt;Dark Sky shut down the Android and Wear OS versions of its apps on August 1st, 2020. But the iOS app is still available &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id517329357"&gt;for $3.99 on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in buying it ahead of next year’s shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KBtqm"&gt;The Dark Sky API will also continue to work for existing customers until the end of 2022. Previously, the API was set to stop working at the end of this year; now, it will work for a little while longer.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new health features bring new focus to elder care technology  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbDIdsB8AyFH5gNMa9_bSViPs5k=/0x133:1690x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434102/824_2021_06_07_824_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ksqI6"&gt;Apple’s new health features will be available for anyone with an iPhone. But two of the tools announced at WWDC 2021, walking steadiness and the ability to share health data with family members, could be particularly useful for older adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOBiA0"&gt;People who work with older adults are excited that a company like Apple is interested in tech that could be used for this group. Experts have spent years frustrated that companies don’t design products to meet the needs of that demographic. There have been a few attempts to introduce new tools, but none got much traction, says Richard Schulz, a social psychologist studying aging at the University of Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHXROR"&gt;“I think the reason is that the big boys — companies like Apple — never got into it,” Schulz says. The new features are a signal that the tide is starting to turn. “Apple getting into this is a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EzfAG0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of falling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gUjfyk"&gt;The first feature, the walking steadiness indicator, targets a major issue for older adults: falling. Falls are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/older-adult-falls/index.html"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of accidents, injury, and death for seniors in the US, and they’re responsible for billions in healthcare costs each year. Researchers have been studying falls — and trying to figure out ways to prevent them — for decades, says ‪Jacob Sosnoff‬, who studies mobility in the department of physical therapy and rehabilitation science at the University of Kansas Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GShEH"&gt;“We can do a really good job in the lab measuring walking impairment and making predictions and recommendations, but we’re not very good in the real world,” Sosnoff says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYMN0E"&gt;Apple’s new walking steadiness feature aims to track people as they move through their daily lives. It uses metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground to monitor how stable a user is. It can only be measured on the iPhone, not an Apple Watch, because some of the metrics have to be calculated from as close to the hip as possible, Apple says — so in a pocket or a bag works best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMjGjD"&gt;Apple Watch already has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936113/apple-watch-emergency-sos-fall-detection-set-up-how-to"&gt;fall detection&lt;/a&gt; feature that can prompt users to call emergency services or automatically make a call if the user is immobile for around a minute. The new iPhone capability focuses on prediction, rather than response: it can tell people if they’re walking steadily and issue an alert if it thinks they’re at an increased risk of falling. Apple says the system is based on data collected during a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/get-involved/apple-heart-and-movement-study"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; that included over 100,000 participants of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ljt9QL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Having people be aware of their fall risk is important”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52srye"&gt;There are no major commercial products that track the quality of people’s movement, Sosnoff says. Until now, most movement trackers have focused on how much people moved. “That’s why there’s a lot of excitement about this,” he says. “Having people be aware of their fall risk is important.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMYTXH"&gt;But there’s also a downside to telling people that they might fall — fear of falling is linked to actually experiencing a fall. If alerts increase that fear, people might limit their physical activity or even stop leaving the house as much, says Clara Berridge, a professor at the University of Washington who studies healthcare technology in aging populations. “That will likely contribute to their actual risk of falling, because they’re decreasing their strength and activity,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9EKJ3"&gt;It’s a fine balance, Sosnoff says. “We want people to be aware of the risks but not so overly concerned that they don’t do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeJu5B"&gt;Sosnoff says he’s eager to see if the walking steadiness feature could actually reduce falls in real-world scenarios. One challenge for the tool could be monitoring people whose walking is impaired — like people with a limp, for example. Algorithms that track gait often don’t work as well in those situations, he says. If the Apple feature has that problem, it could flag people with different walking patterns who might not actually be a fall risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMxUFg"&gt;The Apple feature may not be able to help everyone at fall risk. Walking patterns are only one of the many reasons people fall: poor eyesight with age can cause people to trip, certain medications can reduce balance, and items around the house (like loose rugs) can be hazardous. The Apple walking steadiness feature is designed to suggest that people who are at risk of falling do various stability exercises, which can be useful in some cases. But for some people, balance may not be the main problem. “Getting prompted to do exercises isn’t the only solution,” Berridge says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kyioTD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I know many older adults that leave their phone on the counter just like it’s a traditional phone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rbb8oE"&gt;Getting information on a user’s walk also requires that they carry their phone around regularly. Sosnoff says he’s not sure older adults actually do. Many may use their phones in different ways than younger people. “I know many older adults that leave their phone on the counter just like it’s a traditional phone,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpeiGI"&gt;There are advantages, though, to having a player like Apple working on falls. “They’re going to have a significant amount of data to help see what’s going on,” Sosnoff says. If the iPhone could actually prevent falls, it’d be a huge boon. “We put people back together again if they fall and get hurt, but we don’t really do much to stop the fall. It would be exciting if we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="S6B7H1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8YOgpd"&gt;Apple will also now let users share their health data with other people. The feature could be a major convenience for family members and caregivers of older adults, who may want or need to keep track of someone’s health metrics. Currently, they might have to collect information from multiple different sources — a heart rate app, a blood pressure monitor system. The Apple sharing feature could give them direct access in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rpjt7n"&gt;“I could see this being extremely appealing for adult children,” Berridge says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foxb1Z"&gt;It also raises privacy concerns for older adults. The Apple feature is controlled entirely by the user, who gets to decide in the app what information they want shared and with whom. In reality, though, older people who aren’t comfortable with technology may not be able to take charge of that decision themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GukAx"&gt;“It’s very common to have an adult child purchase a phone for an older adult, and set up the settings, and take the phone out of their hand and say, ‘let me just fix it for you,’” Berridge says. “That older adult is going to lose the capacity to keep this information from the family member.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lAgHDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That older adult is going to lose the capacity to keep this information from the family member”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1hsRR"&gt;Some people might be very comfortable opening up their Health app to family members, but there’s still a power dynamic involved. Older adults tend to like monitoring technology less than their adult children, and say they want to maintain their privacy without feeling watched. But their adult children are confident that they can convince parents to use monitoring technology, even if they say they’re uncomfortable with it, Berridge’s research &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31102442/"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re not necessarily inclined to engage them in the conversation, they’re just very confident that their preferences would rule at the end of the day,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YORt02"&gt;On the flip side, adult children who use this feature might find themselves inundated with information about their older parents that they’re not sure how to interpret, says social psychologist Schulz. “Decisions have to be made about how that information is parsed and translated for the person who’s getting access,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyIhsr"&gt;In practice, Berridge isn’t sure how useful it would be to have a family member see all of the Health app data. “People may say, okay, what do I do with this information exactly? At what point is it meaningful, when do I call a doctor, and so on. It could be an alert overload situation, too.” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biuqC2"&gt;Despite those concerns, there’s increasing interest in ways to keep older adults healthy at home. The COVID-19 pandemic showed that senior care facilities can be dangerous, and people generally don’t want to live in them, Berridge says. The new features from Apple highlight movement in that direction. “Moving the monitoring out of facilities and into the home is going to be a major trend,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2TrfS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with true wireless earbuds. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut, even outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;. There are often sizable discounts on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. Right now, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodsDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Firgwc%3D1&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$146 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to $200 or lower. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers, specifically &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163118618412109#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, are also currently selling the AirPods Pro for $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $278&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fHhsSe"&gt;The recently-launched AirPods Max have yet to receive a steep discount, but right now you can pick up the silver and blue configurations at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $50 off their initial retail price, bringing your total to $500. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733321576396561727#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has the same models available for $520, however, Amazon’s price remains the lowest price we’ve seen on the AirPods Max to date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best features of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that Apple didn’t announce onstage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RtIW8Ta8Q5MlQo_Rx191AoHx8Q=/0x0:1688x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433094/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;He didn’t tell you everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zj7aSW"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;had its WWDC keynote on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, where it showed off the big new features coming to its platforms, but it didn’t have time to show off everything coming to the new versions of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipados%2Fipados-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPadOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;. So we’ve combed through the preview pages, Twitter, and a good chunk of the internet to see what interesting features got left out of the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sHaPRg"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 15&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="kLQeaU"&gt;The big features in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS&lt;/a&gt; were the updates to notifications, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime&lt;/a&gt;, and multitasking, but it appears Apple may have been really focusing on the platforms themselves, too. There are a ton of quality-of-life improvements including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="y7L83k"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-brings-new-memoji-customization-with-over-40-outfits-accessibility-options-more/"&gt;More Memoji options&lt;/a&gt; with new outfits and accessibility options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vlFH2t"&gt;FaceTime will let you know when you’re muted but trying to talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DHMxjY"&gt;FaceTime will also let you zoom with the back camera so you can finally show people things across the room without standing up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0xauwK"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210406"&gt;Announce Messages feature&lt;/a&gt; found in AirPods is &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/08/carplay-in-ios-15-announce-messages-with-siri-driving-focus-customization-new-wallpapers/"&gt;coming to CarPlay&lt;/a&gt;, so your phone can automatically read texts out loud while you’re driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2fXplS"&gt;Wary iPhone users will be able to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/apple-will-let-users-stay-on-ios-14-and-receive-security-updates-even-after-ios-15-is-released/"&gt;put off upgrading to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; but still get security updates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EFDRkR"&gt;Find My will be able to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-find-my-network-can-find-your-iphone-when-it-is-powered-off/"&gt;track your iPhone when it’s off&lt;/a&gt; (or even after it’s been factory reset). It’s currently unclear what phones will support this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="95Co4f"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1402000042316210184?s=21"&gt;improved print dialog with more options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="O3hVw7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It looks like iOS 15 is dramatically beefing up the print panel — finally &lt;a href="https://t.co/uXaflPoMPe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uXaflPoMPe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1402000042316210184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FqXAF0"&gt;You’ll get &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-icloud-storage-temporary-expansion/"&gt;free temporary iCloud storage&lt;/a&gt; when you transfer to a new device, but it will only last for three weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FfNAc8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-maps-leaving-arrival-times/"&gt;Leaving and arrival times are coming to Apple Maps&lt;/a&gt;, letting you better plan trips in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RDpJIc"&gt;iPhone apps for iPad &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ipados-15-enables-iphone-apps-in-landscape-mode-for-ipad-users/"&gt;will be able to run in landscape&lt;/a&gt;. No more flipping your iPad around when you need to check the one app that is still iPhone only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PcJTi8"&gt;There will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1401979104975540229?s=20"&gt;push notifications to tell you when it’s going to rain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O0ac5f"&gt;You’ll have the ability to schedule HomeKit devices with Siri (for example, asking it to turn on your bedroom lights at 7PM).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hsSOq5"&gt;Safari is getting the pull-to-refresh mechanism found in Mail and many social network apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lTaCMT"&gt;Accessibility settings like text size and contrast will be able to be set on a per-app basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qAUK9S"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WSig/status/1402002152176893954?s=20"&gt;EXIF data&lt;/a&gt; will be available in Photos, including camera and lens info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KlHvzQ"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1402008820847681536"&gt;You’ll also be able to adjust a photo’s date and time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TlxFLO"&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-apple-tv-remote-photos-more/"&gt;redesigned software Apple TV remote&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;new hardware version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="bhb6cg"&gt;Spotlight will be accessible from the lock screen and Notification Center.&lt;/li&gt;

It’s likely rolling out there because of rampant spamming of SMS in the country — India &lt;a href="https://english.jagran.com/technology/ios-14-6-amazing-indiaspecific-features-that-will-give-your-iphone-a-desi-touch-10016836"&gt;got the feature last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="YvI4La"&gt;Mail is getting a widget, and there’s also a widget to show you how poorly you slept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dovXS1"&gt;iPads are getting the ability to tab through text fields and buttons in apps, as can be done with Macs and in Safari.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BkDWeM"&gt;iPads will support eye-tracking hardware to improve accessibility by letting people control a cursor using just their eyes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="NownQt"&gt;The Monterey portion of the keynote was dominated by an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;incredibly impressive demo&lt;/a&gt; that showed off Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control feature&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple also took the time to discuss Shortcuts, which are coming to macOS. Macs are complex machines, though, and there are a few more fun and useful things that will be coming in the fall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="nmoqSf"&gt;The ability to use your Memoji &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dyountmusic/status/1402433116959084545?s=20"&gt;as your user profile picture&lt;/a&gt; (it’ll even shake its head if you try to log in with the wrong password). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="2b6QvW"&gt;

&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5YcMBxrb25"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5YcMBxrb25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Yount (@dyountmusic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dyountmusic/status/1402460588165435394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FjOpT8"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-macos-monterey-privacy-features/"&gt;software microphone indicator light&lt;/a&gt; in the menu to show when an application is listening to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YkP81U"&gt;A better file copy interface, with the ability to pause and resume transfers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8EPT75"&gt;The easy ability to &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-erase-all-content-settings/"&gt;erase user data, settings, and apps&lt;/a&gt; without re-installing the OS (great for if you’re selling your Mac)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BkvwPu"&gt;The ability to manage your saved passwords in System Preferences. You can also import them from other password managers or export them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KDTUWY"&gt;You can customize the mouse cursor’s outline and fill color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KvxtEv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-automatic-window-resizing/"&gt;Windows will resize&lt;/a&gt; when you move them to another monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oNmXPz"&gt;Shortcuts will let you integrate shell commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FE5yGR"&gt;An improved Go To Folder dialog in Finder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="E62K7I"&gt;And everything coming to... everything&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="uPCoCx"&gt;Of course, Apple is running an &lt;em&gt;ecosystem&lt;/em&gt; here, so many of the features that got announced will be coming to all of its computers. Here are a few more that will also be coming to iPhones, iPads, and Macs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="z0zH2z"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-ipados-15-and-macos-monterey-gain-built-in-two-factor-code-generator-and-autofill/"&gt;A built-in one-time password generator&lt;/a&gt;, similar to Google Authenticator or Authy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="spmEQM"&gt;Safari will detect if websites can support HTTPS and will automatically use it if they do (similar to the HTTPS Everywhere extension).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hXX12H"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/macos-monterey-low-power-mode/"&gt;A low power mode&lt;/a&gt; for macOS and iPad (I can’t wait to see how far I can stretch an M1 MacBook Pro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BtN5pt"&gt;Reminders are also getting a tags feature, similar to the one found in Notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="THeoMs"&gt;The Photos info pane will tell you about what Visual Look Up sees in the picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZdmzFX"&gt;The ability to turn on DownTime whenever, if you really need to focus on something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FhPxUi"&gt;An extension for Edge on Windows that lets you use your iCloud Passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tfdVWLoOXSu2H8CfebLsVTOgAMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643282/lcimg_13fd8fbd_fc86_4ecd_bfd1_7d9df4b29e09.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="RTxMUm"&gt;Wait, you forgot WatchOS 8!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="3W4Tbk"&gt;Well, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;showed off pretty much everything for WatchOS&lt;/a&gt; onstage — it looks like it’s not a big year for the wearable (but I’ll be very happy to get better always-on display support and multiple timers). There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/1402641598752735244?s=20"&gt;some new time complications, though&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uu3swa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just noticed there is a new set of Time complications in watchOS 8.  While a slight bit of ‘Sherlocking’ for Watchsmith, I’m honestly super glad it’s here.  A good number of my gray hairs came from supporting time based complications…glad I can focus elsewhere now. &lt;a href="https://t.co/q44aVDMoZh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q44aVDMoZh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Smith (@_DavidSmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/1402641598752735244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>With iCloud Plus, Apple’s privacy promise is paired with an upsell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jNNneQHsZgLw96texISzkDykoEs=/321x158:2040x1304/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432729/appleprivacy_vsavov2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some privacy may be paywalled&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="DAnKrI"&gt;Apple has spent considerable time championing itself as a protector of user privacy. Its CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that privacy is “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9437717/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-car-npr-interview"&gt;a fundamental human right&lt;/a&gt;,” the company has based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446220/apple-privacy-ad-video-ad-tracking-transparency"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266276/apple-iphone-ad-privacy-facetime-bug"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420108/apple-new-over-sharing-ad-privacy-security-iphone"&gt;campaigns&lt;/a&gt; around its privacy promises, and it’s had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook"&gt;high profile battles&lt;/a&gt; with authorities to keep its users’ devices private and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub0zXv"&gt;The pitch is simple: our products protect your privacy. But this promise has shifted very subtly in the wake of this week’s iCloud Plus announcement, which for the first time bundled new security protections into a paid subscription service. The pitch is still “our products keep you safe,” but now one of those “products” is a monthly subscription that doesn’t come with the device in your box — even if those devices are getting more built-in protections as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48bdJE"&gt;iCloud has always been one of Apple’s simplest services. You get 5GB of free storage to backup &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207428"&gt;everything from images, to messages and app data&lt;/a&gt;, and you pay a monthly subscription if you want more (or just want to silence &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/icloud-storage-your-guide-to-the-other-apple-tax-1516820540"&gt;Apple’s ransom note&lt;/a&gt; when you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17168618/apple-more-free-icloud-space-200gb"&gt;inevitably run out of storage&lt;/a&gt;). Apple isn’t changing anything about the pricing or storage options as part of the shift to iCloud Plus. Prices will still range from $0.99 a month for 50GB of storage up to $9.99 for 2TB. But what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; changing is the list of features you’re getting, which is expanding by three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5aUsX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Private Relay and Hide my Email are privacy features included with iCloud Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEZYZl"&gt;The first change sits more within iCloud’s traditional cloud storage remit, and is an expansion of Apple’s existing HomeKit Secure Video offering. iCloud Plus now lets you securely stream and record from an &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/#:~:text=%20and%202tb%20with%20an%20unlimited%20number%20of%20homekit%20secure%20video%20cameras%20(%249.99%20per%20month)"&gt;unlimited number of cameras&lt;/a&gt;, up from a previous &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph7bc5df9d9/ios#:~:text=up%20to%20five%20cameras"&gt;maximum of five&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGfrOg"&gt;With the new Private Relay and Hide My Mail features, however, iCloud Plus is expanding its remit from a storage-based service into a storage and privacy service. The privacy-focused additions are minor in the grand scheme of the protections Apple offers across its ecosystem, and Apple isn’t using them as justification for increasing the cost of iCloud. But they nevertheless open the door to so-called “premium” privacy features becoming a part of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;large and growing services empire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwdyUq"&gt;The features appear as an admission from Apple about the limits of what privacy protections can do on-device. “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169781/apple-google-privacy-troll-billboard"&gt;What happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;” was how the company put its promise in a 2019 ad, but when your iPhone needs to connect to the internet to browse the web, receive email, and generally earn the “i” in “iPhone,” inevitably some of its privacy rests on the infrastructure serving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPFpAY"&gt;The most interesting of these new features is Apple’s Private Relay, which aims to shield your web traffic from prying eyes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;. It hides your data from both internet service providers as well as advertisers that might build a detailed profile on you based on your browsing history. While it sounds a bit like a VPN, Apple claims the Private Relay’s dual-hop design means even Apple itself doesn’t have a complete picture of your browsing data. Regular VPNs, meanwhile, require a level of trust that means you &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/free-vpn-bad-for-privacy/"&gt;need to be careful&lt;/a&gt; about which VPN you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeG-p67DnKMzS4Km-DT-vaYOwNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649047/icloud_private_relay_diagram.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJD1oh"&gt;As Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering explains, VPNs can protect your data from outsiders, but they “involve putting a lot of trust in a single centralized entity: the VPN provider. And that’s a lot of responsibility for that intermediary, and involves the user making a really difficult trust decision about exposing all of that information to a single entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98pAcd"&gt;“We wanted to take that completely out of the equation by having a dual-hop architecture,” Federighi &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90643627/apple-privacy-wwdc-private-relay-vpn-icloud-plus-macos-monterey"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPQkKW"&gt;Here’s how it works. When using Private Relay your internet traffic is being sent via two proxy servers on its way to its destination. First, your traffic gets encrypted before it leaves your device. Then, once it hits the initial, Apple-operated server, it gets assigned an anonymous IP that hides your specific location. Next up, the second server, which is controlled by a third-party, decrypts the web address and forwards the traffic to its destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gDWvR6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple thinks today’s VPNs pose “a really difficult trust decision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTFmCY"&gt;Apple can’t see which website you’re requesting, only the IP address you’re requesting it from, and third-parties can’t see that IP address, only the website you’re requesting. (Apple says it also uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163871/cloudflare-apple-dns-protocol-online-privacy"&gt;Oblivious DNS over HTTPS.&lt;/a&gt;) That’s different from most “double VPN” and “multi-hop” VPN services you can subscribe to today, where a provider may control both servers. You could perhaps combine a VPN and a proxy server to do something similar, though. Apple says Private Relay won’t impact performance, which can be a concern with these other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzT2am"&gt;While Private Relay is theoretically more private than a regular VPN, Apple’s offering is also more limited. You can’t use it to trick websites into thinking you’re accessing them from a different location, so you’re not going to be able to use Private Relay to get around geographical limitations on content blocked by a government or a service like Netflix. And it only seems to cover web browsing data through Safari, not third-party browsers or native apps. In a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10096/"&gt;WWDC developer session&lt;/a&gt; about the feature, Apple says that Private Relay will also include DNS queries and a “small subset of traffic from apps,” specifically insecure HTTP traffic. But there was no mention of other browsers, and Apple clarified to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s only handling app traffic when your app technically happens to be loading the web inside a browser window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Dtq6yXo9hGGm4aRcOWg0hXgVLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649697/Apple_iPhone12Pro_mail_new_message_hide_my_email_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hide my Email provides a slick interface for making burner email addresses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68gn2K"&gt;In addition to Private Relay, iCloud Plus also includes Hide my Email, a feature designed to protect the privacy of your email address. Instead of needing to use your real email address for every site that requests it (increasing the risk of an important part of your login credentials becoming public, not to mention getting inundated with spam), Hide My Email lets you generate and share unique random addresses which will then forward any messages they receive back to your true email address. It’s another privacy-focused feature that sits outside of iCloud’s traditional area of focus, and could be useful even if similar options have been available for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umJUM7"&gt;Gmail, for example, lets you use a simple “+” symbol to&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6100893/how-to-make-your-email-address-as-hard-to-guess-as-your-password"&gt; add random extra characters to your email address&lt;/a&gt;. Even Apple’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650885/apple-sign-in-sso-tool-data-collection-privacy-ios-13-wwdc-2019"&gt;“Sign In with Apple” service&lt;/a&gt; pulls a similar trick, handing out random email addresses to each service you use it with. But the advantage of Apple’s new service is that it gives you an easily-accessible shortcut to generate them right in its Mail app and Safari, putting the feature front and center in a way that seems likely to boost its mainstream appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OktZBM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plenty of privacy still included with standard purchase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wE7vYu"&gt;Apple might be charging for Private Relay and Hide My Email by bundling them into iCloud subscriptions, but these iCloud Plus additions are still dwarfed by the array of privacy protections already built into Apple’s hardware and software. There’s no sign that any of these existing privacy features will be locked behind a monthly subscription fee anytime soon. Indeed, the list of built-in protections Apple offers continues to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvnlgS"&gt;This includes a new Mail Privacy Protection feature in the Mail app in iOS 15, which sends your emails through a relay service to confuse any tracking pixels that might be hiding in them (read more about tracking pixels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681508/tracking-pixel-email-spying-superhuman-web-beacon-open-tracking-read-receipts-location"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). There’s also a new App Privacy Report feature coming to iOS 15 that will show how often apps are accessing your location, camera, microphone, and other data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pHcRXNO6nTE0sIh-lo-fiCFma6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649702/Apple_iPhone12Pro_settings_privacy_app_privacy_report_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhones’ list of built-in privacy features continues to expand with iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZojtJ"&gt;But with iCloud Plus, Apple now offers two privacy protections that are distinct from those that are included for free with the purchase of a device, and the division between the two seems arbitrary to some extent. Apple justifies charging for features like Private Relay and Hide My Email because of the incremental costs of running those services, but Mail Privacy Protection also relies on a relay server, which presumably isn’t free to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t46jic"&gt;Regardless of its rationale, choosing to charge for these services means that Apple has opened the door to premium privacy features becoming part of its increasingly important services business, beyond just its hardware business. Adherence to privacy was already part of the company’s attempt to lock you into its devices; now it could become part of the attempt to lock you into its services. All the while, those &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-airpods-macbook-you-live-in-apples-world-heres-what-you-are-missing-11622817653?mod=followjoannastern"&gt;walls around Apple’s garden&lt;/a&gt; creep higher and higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIhUI7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uf8Rp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJDmFx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaoj9p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLU8A2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lagAh9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="iDMtyW"&gt;iOS 4 originally appeared nearly 10 years ago as Apple’s first mobile operating system to drop the iPhone OS naming convention. An 18-year-old developer has now lovingly recreated iOS 4 as an iPhone app, and it’s a beautiful blast from the past. If you never got the chance to use iOS 4, or you’re a fan of the iPhone 3G, OldOS almost flawlessly pulls off the experience of using an iPhone from a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aF5lrw"&gt;OldOS is “designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible,” says Zane, the developer behind the app. It’s all built using Apple’s SwiftUI, so it includes buttery smooth animations and even the old iPhone home button that vibrates with haptic feedback to make it feel like a real button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TJOAq"&gt;Apple’s built-in iOS 4 apps have also been recreated here, and it’s a real flashback to the skeuomorphic days of the iPhone whenever they launch. Photos lets you view your existing camera roll as you would have 10 years ago, while Notes transports you back to the yellow post-it notes of yesteryear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZXRH7j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today is Launch Day  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing OldOS — iOS 4 beautifully rebuilt in SwiftUI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*   Designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible.&lt;br&gt;*  Fully functional, perhaps even usable as a second OS.&lt;br&gt;*  ️ Fully open source for all to learn, modify, and build on. &lt;a href="https://t.co/K0JOE2fEKM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K0JOE2fEKM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zane (@zzanehip) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zzanehip/status/1402625414762270723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I0N5hY"&gt;The only apps that don’t work as you might expect are Messages and YouTube. Apple used to bundle YouTube directly into its operating system, and the developer behind OldOS says there are “still some major issues with YouTube” and Messages that they’re working to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuHOBz"&gt;Everything else is mostly flawless. and you can even browse the web in the old UI of Safari. The App Store also list apps that will redirect you to the modern store to download and install. There are some things that simply don’t work, including folders and no jiggling to rearrange home screen apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dw0gz"&gt;We’ve seen this type of nostalgic app appear on the iPhone before. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010953/apple-iphone-ipod-app-rewound-app-store-features-music-player-apple-music"&gt;Rewound launched in the App Store&lt;/a&gt; back in December 2019, turning an iPhone into an iPod. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024729/apple-rewound-app-iphone-ipod-click-wheel-web-android-not-available"&gt;Apple quickly pulled the app&lt;/a&gt; a few days later, citing store violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmWMWl"&gt;This latest &lt;a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/67C9v9VB"&gt;OldOS app is available on Apple’s TestFlight&lt;/a&gt; service, which is typically used to distribute beta versions of apps. That means it probably won’t last long before Apple takes exception, so grab it while you can. Zane has also published the source code for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project"&gt;entire project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re willing to compile it in Xcode then it will live forever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple may have accidentally confirmed the existence of an M1X MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQZIHF05TX0m46MhjejfbxYvORg=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69429868/retina-macbook-pro-15-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the new MacBook Pro, but it does have ports that are tipped to return!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GWELYT"&gt;Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote came and went this year without a new MacBook Pro — but it looks like that wasn’t the original intent! Intriguingly, Apple quietly included the phrases “M1X MacBook Pro” and “M1X” as tags &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TD96VTf0Xs"&gt;on its YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; of the live keynote, as spotted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maxbalzer_/status/1402626084265500679"&gt;by Max Balzer&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/09/m1x-macbook-pro-referenced-in-metadata-for-apples-wwdc-youtube-video/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cl9C5u"&gt;Not only does that sound like tacit confirmation of at least one new Arm-powered MacBook Pro, it also corroborates the rumors that it’ll include a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;, and that Apple will likely market it as an enhanced “X” variant, like it used to do with its high-end iPads, rather than going straight to M2. (Or, as some are pointing out, it could mean that someone on the social media team decided to try for an SEO boost and made it up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtQeP6"&gt;Three weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman reported&lt;/a&gt; that we’d see redesigned 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros “as early as this summer,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;ones that would&lt;/a&gt; bring back the SD card slot, HDMI port, and some form of the beloved trip-friendly MagSafe charging connector; offer twice as many high-performance CPU and GPU cores; and support up to 64GB of RAM. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;I really thought&lt;/a&gt; announcing them at WWDC would be the perfect way to distract from recent developer turmoil — you know, by announcing a MacBook Pro that’s actually for pros? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqEEJD"&gt;Perhaps that was the original idea, but we got an absolutely jam-packed keynote filled with rapid-fire software announcements instead. Check out our supercut below for the condensed video version, or read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;our list of the 15 biggest WWDC 2021 announcements&lt;/a&gt; if you only want the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ptwKW"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="WWDC 2021|102453" data-volume-uuid="7c6d9d097" data-volume-id="102453" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-810" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hcpC2U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 6:11PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added the possibility that Apple just wanted to boost this video in search by adding some words that might draw attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEXRxX"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MacBook Air is the most impressive laptop I’ve used in years" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1z5Ah"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — all of which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is currently lining up deals ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place on June 21st and 22nd. However, for now, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base configuration of MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD and typically sells for $999. Right now, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$949 ($50 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The retail giant also has the 512GB configuration on sale in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5M9XBS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold for $1,149&lt;/a&gt; ($100 off), as does &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RDkNac"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The MacBook Pro comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $100 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afDps1"&gt;The upgraded, silver version of the M1-touting MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LH3F7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The space gray variant, which typically retails for $1,499 alongside the silver model, is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LM1K3/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742946215000206869#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it to $1,399. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, you can save $200 on the 13-inch model at Amazon, which is available in two configurations: a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,600 at Amazon, or you can buy one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; processor for $1,800 at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. B&amp;amp;H Photo currently has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1520434-REG%2Fapple_mvvj2ll_a_16_macbook_pro_late.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1520436-REG%2Fapple_mvvl2ll_a_16_macbook_pro_late.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; on sale for $2,199 ($200 off). There are other configurations available with more storage and quicker processors, however, not at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the Mac Mini is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We’ve seen the base model drop to as low as $600, which is its current price at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%e2%80%93%E2%80%94silver.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now (coupon applied at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="APBdOd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The creator economy is running into the Apple Tax — this startup is fighting back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The name “Fanhouse” on a tie-dye background. The H is shaped like a house." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3b6H9XwVqaUOTS2WG2nxLnA3Sqw=/0x342:2048x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69429382/EvRNO57WYAEsngW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The logo for Fanhouse, a platform that lets creators charge for access to a private social feed. | Image: Fanhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VxoadZ"&gt;Apple is clashing with the platform &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/"&gt;Fanhouse&lt;/a&gt; over whether it gets to take a cut of in-app payments to creators. The incident underscores just how little Apple understands about the creator economy, with the likely outcome being less money in creators’ pockets — and more money for one of the world’s most profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQfXy8"&gt;Founders of Fanhouse — which is basically OnlyFans without the nudity — say the platform will be kicked out of the App Store in August if it doesn’t start forking over 30 percent of the fees people pay creators when purchases are made through the iPhone app. One of Fanhouse’s creators, the streamer &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/breadwitchery/fanwall"&gt;Breadwitchery&lt;/a&gt;, says that cut would mean losing two months of rent from her earnings to date. The company doesn’t have a lot of options to push back, but it’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1402691047940100100"&gt;launching a campaign today&lt;/a&gt; to pressure Apple into easing its rules around payments to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D37kCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I use this to pay the bills for my family.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aMflPk"&gt;Fanhouse is only the latest company to clash with Apple over App Store terms that are increasingly viewed as steep and domineering. Sure, it’s a small app, and its disappearance won’t necessarily cause problems for Apple, but the situation speaks to the challenges creator-focused apps face in the App Store. As the creator economy continues to grow, the rules mean Apple will be taking more money from not just businesses, but individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVCxDY"&gt;“People are using this platform to survive, starting with me, our very first creator,” Jasmine Rice, &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/jasminericegirl/fanwall"&gt;a Fanhouse creator&lt;/a&gt; and one of the platform’s co-founders, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “I use this to pay the bills for my family. I use this to pay my mom’s medical expenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EtD4I"&gt;Fanhouse, which launched in 2020, initially slipped past the App Store bouncers and offered payments on the web without issue. Now that Apple has spotted the potential for profit, it’s given Fanhouse the same ultimatum it gives (almost) everyone else: Fanhouse either needs to pay up or get booted from the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="vVpFM6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple often takes a larger cut than the actual platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bc2LQV"&gt;The app only takes a 10 percent cut on its own, so the platform’s creators could soon be earning a whole lot less. Rice says she would be okay with handing Apple a 30 percent cut of Fanhouse’s own profits. But once that 30 percent has to cut into creators’ profits, it starts to hurt &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, not just the platform. “This money really means a second job for some people, that they have a place to live, that they can afford tuition,” Rice says. “And we tried to explain this to Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsCEqe"&gt;Fanhouse allows creators to charge a subscription for access to a private social media feed where they can post updates about their life or publish photos and videos. Creators can also earn money from tips, or they can post “locked” updates that fans need to pay to view. Each account also has a public feed that can be viewed without a subscription, which may be why the app was able to slip through the App Store unnoticed until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fojC0h"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it’s working with Fanhouse to bring the app into compliance with its rules. The company referred to &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase"&gt;its in-app purchase guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and said Fanhouse was rejected previously because of a similar violation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ue8vgJ"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fuckapple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fuckapple&lt;/a&gt;, a thread&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I cofounded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fanhouseapp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@fanhouseapp&lt;/a&gt; 8 months ago to empower creators to monetize their content. We pay creators 90% of earnings. Now, Apple is threatening to remove Fanhouse from the app store unless we give them 30% of creator earnings. This is theft and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;— jasmine   (@jasminericegirl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1402691047940100100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ciuIBg"&gt;Apple requires a 30 percent cut from in-app purchases of “digital” goods, such as &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins or Netflix subscriptions, though it has a number of exceptions. The figure is reduced to 15 percent for multiyear subscriptions and apps that earn under $1 million. (Fanhouse has more than $1 million in revenue, but it pays nearly all of it out to creators.) And it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;up to Apple to decide&lt;/a&gt; what qualifies as a “digital” good and what doesn’t. For instance, Apple allows Patreon to offer third-party payment solutions for creators rather than use in-app purchases, avoiding the fee. Other apps aren’t afforded that privilege. Apple and Patreon did not respond to a request for comment on the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="QkpcIF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think it speaks to a creator illiteracy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wAnZPt"&gt;Apple’s App Store rules didn’t even acknowledge creators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;until this week&lt;/a&gt;. On Monday, they were updated with a new section saying that creator-made content and experiences are allowed in apps — so long as they’re properly moderated and monetized for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOP5P3"&gt;The problem is likely to become more acute as platforms offer more ways for creators to get paid. Twitter plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447328/twitter-ticketed-spaces-monetization-stripe-approval"&gt;take a 20 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; from ticketed audio rooms later this year, from which Apple will take another 30 percent if fans pay on their iPhones. Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522706/facebook-creators-apple-google-fees-payment-interface-events"&gt;waiving its cut&lt;/a&gt; for the next year on fan subscriptions and other sources of creator revenue, but Apple will still be taking 30 percent when purchases are made through its store. Twitch already hands Apple a 30 percent cut of subscriptions and tips made through iOS, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/18/20921448/twitch-subscription-ios-app-store-price"&gt;it hikes prices there&lt;/a&gt; so that viewers have to cover the added costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZzZqi"&gt;Other creator-focused services simply aren’t offered on iOS because of Apple’s rules: Spotify doesn’t let listeners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;pay for podcast subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;, despite offering them, and OnlyFans isn’t available on the platform at all because of Apple’s ban on “overtly sexual or pornographic material.” The newsletter &lt;em&gt;Means of Creation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://every.to/means-of-creation/apple-is-holding-back-the-creator-economy"&gt;criticized these policies last month&lt;/a&gt;, writing that “Apple is now one of the main barriers to independent creators thriving on the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDAm7R"&gt;Apple is currently caught in a legal battle with Epic, the maker of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite,&lt;/em&gt; over its App Store fees. Apple is happy with its cut: it brought in $64 billion in revenue last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/apples-app-store-had-gross-sales-around-64-billion-in-2020.html"&gt;according to a CNBC analysis&lt;/a&gt;. During the trial, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that allowing other payment options “would in essence give up our total return on our IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32RExv"&gt;“I think it speaks to a creator illiteracy,” says Breadwitchery, a narrative games streamer who works part time as a community manager for Fanhouse. “Those corporations like Apple, do you not think that if you invest in creators and treat them well, they’re going to be motivated to make more content and make more money?”&lt;/p&gt;
