    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-997" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET95QnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET95QnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestiPadDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-232" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a new pair, the lowest price you can get them for currently is $219 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get them for $220 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F66960X1514734X399deab46224a444932767312ff6c84b#donotlink"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, but if deals at those retailers sell out, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; has them for $235.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html#donotlink"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is selling a bundle that includes both for $235&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rFr0TF"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad 2020 review: here we go again, again|95745" data-volume-uuid="d243cb26d" data-volume-id="95745" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-193" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;You can currently get the base iPad with 32GB of storage at Amazon for $320 ($9 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J9699?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $400 if you buy it in gold&lt;/a&gt;, which is $29 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s2PEas"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pxIjz0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad mini 2019 review: the best small tablet|63300" data-volume-uuid="e735355f0" data-volume-id="63300" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-953" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD48RS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$385 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD48RS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD2NQ7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; only) or for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html"&gt;$394 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$529 in space gray&lt;/a&gt;, or just $1 more, you can get this model in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PSFYBw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="WfS02T"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Air (2020) review|96393" data-volume-uuid="6c97cb5b6" data-volume-id="96393" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-804" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen, and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u6ZCyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air (2020) review: take it from the Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByT0LP"&gt;The best deal you can currently get on the iPad Air fourth-gen is at Micro Center. The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;Amazon currently has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi in all colors on sale&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from $549 to $570 depending on the color you select. Walmart has the same configuration on sale for $559 if you buy the 64GB iPad Air with Wi-Fi in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Green%2F968764839%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestiPadDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Rose-Gold%2F149437127%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestiPadDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted at Amazon; you can get this model for $699 ($50 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FTH75?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FVJMX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration on sale for $849&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="G5QUP2"&gt;Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,249 in space gray;&lt;/a&gt; that’s $50 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eK4A7f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $949&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage. If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ffc689de651b8297993943adb5f6d337&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,199&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2My51r"&gt;The 12.9-inch 1TB model with Wi-Fi only is also discounted at Amazon. You can get it in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08637TYPT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray for $1,394&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08631SHQJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399 if you buy it in silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new app Bars will let you rap over premade beats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LepSaA3ZJKEFT3WfYWUtNP5GEo0=/0x55:1612x1130/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68882350/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_12.46.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BARS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dziSZt"&gt;Despite being an annoying hipster, I definitely did not see this one coming: Facebook is &lt;a href="https://npe.fb.com/2021/02/26/introducing-bars-a-new-beta-test-empowering-rappers-to-create-and-share/"&gt;releasing an app&lt;/a&gt; that will let users post and share videos of them rapping over beats, which are provided by the app (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9gCmn"&gt;The app is called Bars, and its main selling point is it provides the beats and lets you create 60-second rap videos over them. According to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, you can then post the video to a TikTok-style feed, where people can watch it and mark it as “fire” (that is, of course, if your skills are up to par). The app also promises “studio quality vocal effects,” including actual, honest-to-goodness AutoTune. I hope there’s a slider that goes from “making my voice passable” to “T-Pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8Tnbl"&gt;The app also promises an auto-rhyme dictionary for those who mark themselves as “beginners” in the app’s sign-up. For those closer to the “Advanced” level, it also promises a Freestyle mode, which gives you eight random words to work into a 16-bar off-the-cuff rap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPbGu4hVKLA4hMRJG8wuQRWEMeM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331886/IMG_0899.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have anything lower?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="igLRfi"&gt;If you’re itching to lay down some Bars, I have some bad news: the app seems to currently be in closed beta, but you can at least sign up to secure your username and get a place in line for when the app starts opening up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IVSXhF9yqYWug35xEN_x4fdmCRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331863/IMG_0902.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I promise you, Bars will never be ready for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DqgwBTPCHU-cMWTvR6jIss76uFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331841/IMG_0903.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hopefully this is not indicative of the quality you can expect from the auto-rhyme suggestions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sBPnlT"&gt;I’m going to be honest, I don’t understand why the, erm, bars in the App Store description are so weak. The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/getbarsapp"&gt;announcement rap posted on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is honestly not bad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLw9UUXAH7E/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"&gt;A post shared by BARS (@getbarsapp)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3x0Hq"&gt;The app promises it’ll provide professionally made beats for you to rap over, and if the examples it’s posting on Instagram are indicative of the overall quality, that may actually be the case. They sound way closer to what you’d hear in an actual song than to the embarrassing things I’ve posted to SoundCloud. (No, I’m not linking that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JASKIa"&gt;The app is being made by Facebook’s New Product Experimentation group, which also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174882/facebook-collab-app-store-release-date-price"&gt;released a similar musical app called Collab last year&lt;/a&gt; that allows musicians to make songs together, each providing separate parts. After scrolling through that app a bit, my hopes for Bars are slightly diminished, as the audio quality isn’t near the level of what the Bars previews promise. That said, I can see Bars being able to fine-tune its EQ, as it will really only have to deal with the human voice, rather than an infinite range of instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYz1H0"&gt;So far, the app is &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1521789321"&gt;only on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and I wouldn’t hold my breath for an Android version; it doesn’t seem like Collab has made it to the Play Store yet, either. For as much fun as I’ve poked, though, I actually will genuinely keep this app until it lets me in — not so I can actually contribute (goodness no) but so I can see what people come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5g3b1"&gt;Facebook was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to import your passwords to Apple’s iCloud Keychain via Safari</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OsVjsU6G0bj8eULNx5anaZKbU_U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68881473/acastro_200207_3900_Safari_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6H1EGD"&gt;If you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;moving from LastPass&lt;/a&gt; (or another password manager you’re dissatisfied with), you may be tempted to simply go with the password manager that comes with your browser or operating system. It’s certainly an easy solution, and a reasonable one, depending on your point of view. Until recently, third-party password managers were known to be more secure, but Apple and Google have been working to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21299007/google-password-checkup-security"&gt;make their built-in password managers more secure&lt;/a&gt;, while Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178026/microsoft-authenticator-autofill-feature-password-manager"&gt;adding one to its authenticator app&lt;/a&gt;. So it could be a viable choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIrfb8"&gt;One way, however, that these built-in password managers don’t stand up to their independent competitors is how tricky it can be to get preexisting passwords into their systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUIylU"&gt;If you tend to hang out in the Apple ecosystem, that means using Safari for your passwords and passing them to your other devices using Apple’s iCloud Keychain. Here’s how to move your password data into iCloud Keychain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3iaobb"&gt;Make sure you have Keychain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNYrDD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085"&gt;iCloud Keychain&lt;/a&gt; is how Apple syncs your information across devices — not just passwords, but also credit card info, Wi-Fi passwords, etc. If you haven’t used it, you may want to check to make sure it’s been set up and turned on. (If you plan to use your passwords on your mobile iOS device as well, you might want to check it there, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GU1kSS"&gt;Using a macOS device:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zZK5R8"&gt;Go to your System Preferences app by clicking on the Apple icon in the upper-left corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jNZy3y"&gt;If you have macOS Mojave or earlier, click iCloud. Otherwise, select Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TLKOau"&gt;Go down the list of apps, and make sure that Keychain is checked &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Make sure you have iCloud Keychain." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tNQ8XHABWmxZWhs-w0blzpKxbkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331105/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_10.36.30_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure you have iCloud Keychain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jV8VG5"&gt;Using an iOS device:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="De2zIJ"&gt;Go to Settings and tap on your name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bRyrHO"&gt;Tap on iCloud and scroll down to Keychain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="800PQp"&gt;If Keychain is Off, tap on the entry and then toggle it on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kb9IsI"&gt;Import your password data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xIrUC1"&gt;In order to get your data into Keychain, you need to import it into Safari on your Mac. Simple, right? Well, not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UA0cnx"&gt;Unfortunately, unlike most password managers, you can’t import passwords from a CSV file into Safari. You can, however, import passwords from either &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. So if you’ve got a CSV file from another password manager and you don’t have either of those browsers on your machine, you’ll have to install one of them first and upload your passwords into it. (You can find instructions for importing passwords into Chrome &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Firefox &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-login-data-file"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01WRVq"&gt;Once your passwords have been imported into one of the other browsers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="j5DCbg"&gt;Close the other browser &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zVLYAs"&gt;Open Safari, go to File &amp;gt; Import From, and choose Chrome or Firefox. You can import Bookmarks, History, Passwords, or any combination thereof by checking the appropriate boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lkiN5Eirfi3wWaQhNw9rrpOWui8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331032/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_12.13.11_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rZkMJ0"&gt;One note: I had a series of mishaps trying to import from Firefox into Safari. Safari would invariably crash, even after I made a series of tweaks to Firefox. I finally gave up and tried it with Chrome, and the import worked immediately. Your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ophEl"&gt;You can check to see if the import worked by going to Safari’s top menu and selecting Safari &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Passwords. (You’ll have to enter your user password to access the password list.) You should see your passwords listed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zEbW2"&gt;Once you’ve imported your passwords into Safari, they should be automatically picked up by iCloud Keychain and useable across all your approved devices. You can check by typing and clicking on “Keychain Access” using Spotlight Search. That should bring up your Keychain app; you can click on iCloud in the top-left column and “Passwords” in the bottom left to see your imported passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You should find your passwords in Keychain Access (for obvious reasons, some data has been grayed out)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Shn_5X1oR9y7TNc1-nnx92oReE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331082/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_11.41.24_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should find your passwords in Keychain Access. (For obvious reasons, some data has been grayed out.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>Apple releases macOS update to prevent damage from third-party docks and dongles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m0Rl9eA8x4jFRPdy7kSjjTyKZHk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68877154/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o0q8nV"&gt;Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275582/apple-free-replacement-program-macbook-pro-batteries-2016-2017-one-percent"&gt;once again&lt;/a&gt; releasing an update to prevent a charging problem from killing MacBooks — this time it’s to fix a problem where 2019 and later MacBook Pros, and 2020 and later MacBook Airs were being damaged when connected to third-party USB-C hubs and docks (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/apple-releases-macos-big-sur-11-2-2/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVwv7h"&gt;It’s unclear how widespread the issues are, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/comments/kge24m/dead_m1_mac_with_usbc_multiport_adapters/"&gt;a poll on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; had 74 out of 221 respondents report that their M1 Air or Pro had failed after using a hub. As with all polls, it’s best to take the results with a grain of salt, but there’s an indication that some people were experiencing issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj0n1H"&gt;Most of the issues seemed to come from using a third-party dock, and while some of them seem to be from pretty obscure brands, there are a few recognizable ones that are reported to have killed laptops. For its part, Apple calls them “non-compliant powered USB-C hubs and docks” in the new update’s notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6OzhwB9MWbikAoCuK_PR0KokFBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22329349/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_2.03.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a large update, but it’s probably best to install it as soon as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0R5Epn"&gt;It seems like Apple has been having some issues with power delivery recently. The last update, 11.2.1, was released to fix an issue where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275582/apple-free-replacement-program-macbook-pro-batteries-2016-2017-one-percent"&gt;some users were unable to re-charge their computers if they drained to 0 percent battery&lt;/a&gt;,  it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275582/apple-free-replacement-program-macbook-pro-batteries-2016-2017-one-percent"&gt;issued a recall&lt;/a&gt; for other MacBook Pro batteries that wouldn’t charge past one percent, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284492/apple-watch-series-5-se-watchos-7-3-1-update-charge-free-replacement"&gt;another recall&lt;/a&gt; for “a very small number” of Apple Watches that wouldn’t charge after an update. Hopefully this is the last power bug Apple has to work out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFTonY"&gt;If you plug your MacBook into a dock or hub of any kind, it’s probably best to download this update as soon as you can, especially if it’s one of those affected models. Oh, and if you see this message, maybe just make sure you’re plugging it in to an official Apple power brick while you do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUPC7GvRSGFsTRw1Gu1Wy7-Scls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22329523/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_3.08.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This should maybe be done with a first-party power adapter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VII Remake’s amazing soundtrack hits Spotify and Apple Music tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XuvVZP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake’s&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack will be available to stream on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music Unlimited, and other music subscription services tomorrow, February 26th, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1365072967198253057"&gt;Square Enix announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. It will have an eye-popping (ear-popping?) 156 tracks, &lt;a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-ANNOUNCED-FOR-PLAYSTATION5-CONSOLE"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUnasY"&gt;The game’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;soundtrack was an excellent reimagining of the original game’s iconic music, and I frequently listen to it via random YouTube videos. The official arrival on streaming services should make listening to it much easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a9Uuvz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We know you've been waiting a little while for this...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From February 26th, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FinalFantasy&lt;/a&gt; VII Remake Soundtrack will be available on online music subscription services such as Apple Music, Spotify and Amazon Music Unlimited!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/IKSSOEhAxW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IKSSOEhAxW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE (@finalfantasyvii) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1365072967198253057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9H6tD"&gt;The news arrives alongside a flood of other &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;-related announcements. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake &lt;/em&gt;will be getting a PS5 patch with big quality-of-life changes and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;a new episode focused on Yuffie Kisaragi&lt;/a&gt;, an optional party member from the original game. Square Enix also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301945/final-fantasy-7-soldier-prequel-battle-royale-android-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new mobile battle royale game that’s set to hit Android and iOS later this year. It’s also developing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301961/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-android-ios-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisi&lt;/em&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; mobile game that looks to be &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; and includes elements of spinoffs like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt; is scheduled to debut in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sRTiof"&gt;At this rate, there may soon be 156 &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;remakes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A court is forcing Valve to tell Apple how much money 436 different PC games made</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqMUYh"&gt;Valve has been compelled by a California court to provide sales data on more than 400 Steam games to Apple and possibly reveal its yearly sales, revenue, and profits to Apple as well. The iPhone maker subpoenaed Valve for the data as part of its ongoing dispute with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COCXIQ"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.356.0.pdf"&gt;to a Wednesday order by Judge Thomas Hixson&lt;/a&gt;, Valve will have to provide yearly sales and pricing data on 436 games that are available on both its PC game distribution platform, Steam, and the Epic Games Store. Apple has requested the data so it can define the video game market in its case against Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBOEl4"&gt;In a filing published on February 18th, Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291297/apple-valve-data-steam-sales-epic-games-dispute"&gt;had argued&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s demands were overly broad. Apple had asked for even more data in its subpoena, including annual revenues from Steam, the name of every app on Steam, and the date range for when those apps had been available. Valve argued that the demands would “impose an extraordinary burden” on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMvvZH"&gt;Valve has also been compelled to share “aggregated data” about how much it makes from Steam, though it’s not clear exactly what that will entail. Apple had asked for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ksuk20"&gt;RFP 2 asks for documents sufficient to show since 2008 Valve’s (a) total yearly sales from apps and in-app purchases from Steam, (b) annual advertising revenue attributable to Steam, (c) annual sales of external products attributable to Steam, (d) annual revenues from Steam, and (e) annual earnings, income or profits from Steam. Apple asks for this information by app if that is available. During meet and confer Apple limited the relevant time period to 2015 to the present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eMV74O"&gt;In his ruling, Judge Hixson largely sided with Apple. “In the letter brief, Valve said this would be an overwhelming amount of work, but other than using adjectives, it did not substantiate or quantify the burden in any way,” Hixson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8vCx"&gt;“Apple has shown that it has a substantial need for this information to obtain evidence in support of its arguments concerning market definition and the effects of competition, and it cannot obtain this information elsewhere without undue burden,” he added. “Valve offers several reasons why Apple has not satisfied this standard, but none is persuasive.” Valve is the biggest PC game store in existence and generally doesn’t provide any sales data whatsoever, though you can find &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110?"&gt;simple unordered lists of the bestselling games&lt;/a&gt; each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9dLK4"&gt;Hixson did narrow the amount of information Valve has to provide. While Apple requested data dating back to 2015, Hixson ruled that Valve only needs to produce data from 2017 to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTzUWa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;Epic sued Apple in August&lt;/a&gt; after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; for introducing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;in-app payment system&lt;/a&gt; that it says violated App Store rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus review: easy mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zedaUNEveL5HlhwlWJ0stnBYtAI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873680/vpavic_210217_4444_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A starter pack for exercise&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Kv1B8z"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus has been out for a couple of months now, and a few of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have been spending that time running it (and ourselves) through its paces. The $9.99-a-month service offers a decent array of exercise videos with an added bonus: integration with the sensors on an Apple Watch. In fact, an Apple Watch is &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to use the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="muA3mz"&gt;Since everybody’s exercise routine is a little different, we wanted to get a variety of perspectives on the service. What’s become clear from all of our testing is that Apple has successfully achieved what we think it set out to do: create an exercise service that is accessible to a broad range of people. There are lots of different ways an exercise service like this could get tripped up, but for the most part, Fitness Plus stays on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPrnZG"&gt;Whether you like the direction that track goes or if it’s long enough to keep your attention for years to come is another matter. It will take more time for Apple to expand its array of options in the service, but it has already added one new kind of exercise — celebrity walk-and-listens — which could bode well for those hoping for future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crjyLA"&gt;But as we always say, never pay for something now in the hopes that it’ll be better in the future. So here’s what we think of Fitness Plus after two months of using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BEBYgzXliQUd7ySaIQvscooBXQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327713/vpavic_4444_20210224_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8SoygW"&gt;The basics of Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eXAL46"&gt;Fitness Plus’ main selling point is it’s easy to jump into — so long as your own oodles of Apple devices. The app requires an Apple Watch to access the classes, and then you’ll need an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV to stream the workouts. (Critically, there’s no way to stream from a Mac, which makes no sense and required me to stream from my tiny iPhone display.) But because the app connects to the Watch, your rings show up in the corner of the screen throughout a workout. It serves as a reminder of how hard you’ve worked and how far you have to go to meet your goals for the day. Some people might find this motivational. I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mO7MNU"&gt;As for equipment, the app offers a variety of cardio workouts, such as cycling, treadmill classes, and rowing, which require special equipment. But it also offers classes like Time to Walk, which Becca will dive into below, and dance classes that require no equipment at all. Most of the strength classes would like you to use dumbbells (which can be hard to find in stock currently), but you could get away with your bodyweight if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="WhZueZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a diverse group of instructors and class formats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PDGNdjC3auqbnBnx8FaTqXqVvjA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327683/vpavic_210224_4444_0025.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hSn92D"&gt;There’s no way to filter classes by equipment requirements or even area of focus, so expect to spend time in the app reading descriptions and watching previews to discern whether a class is for you. This is a pain and a hurdle that shouldn’t exist. Filters by workout type and equipment should be table stakes for any fitness app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnUvSY"&gt;What Apple lacks in filters, though, it slightly makes up for with a diverse group of instructors and class formats. The instructors vary in age, background, and body type, which I immediately noticed and appreciated. (I would still like to see a fitness app incorporate all body types and not just what we typically think of as “fit.”) The strength classes also offer three different sets of instructions: one for the prescribed exercise, another to make it more advanced, and a third to modify for injuries or anyone who needs to take it easy. This is the type of setup you’d see in classic fitness tapes, but I don’t find as much in on-demand classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6yLCH"&gt;This setup contrasts Apple’s biggest competitor in the space, Peloton, which doesn’t offer modifications during its workouts. As someone who has regularly worked out through Peloton’s classes, this was a nice change and one I’d like to see Peloton take as a cue from Apple. —&lt;em&gt;Ashley Carman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wGvrl-fzgg2VUqF0zDUWpqzqs-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327714/vpavic_4444_20210224_0076.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C5YXaV"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus versus Peloton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zDxmB7"&gt;Apple and Peloton are similar when it comes to premise and the primary user experience. You can select workouts with different lengths, different playlists, and different instructors in various categories like cycling, treadmill, strength, and yoga, as well as dedicated cooldowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2w8qO"&gt;I would say the primary reason to use Apple’s program is its seamless integration with the company’s hardware ecosystem. When I start up a workout on my iPad, the workout shows up on my Watch as well, and my Watch’s metrics appear on the iPad’s screen. It’s great to be able to watch my heart rate and rings in real time on the same screen as my workout without having to manually connect anything. You can even launch Fitness Plus playlists in Apple Music if you take a liking to them. (You can sync an Apple Watch with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;Peloton’s Bike Plus&lt;/a&gt;, but its on-screen metrics are limited to cycling workouts.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3MlMy"&gt;I also like that when you start a hill in Apple’s cardio workouts, a clock appears counting down to the end of the interval. I watch that clock religiously during the steepest climbs. It’s easier to survive them when I know exactly how long I have left to endure without having to count in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="xl0YGK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most of the Fitness Plus workouts I tried are around the same level of difficulty &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5fpHK66YG-WhX9nMiZv3WDajC_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327712/vpavic_4444_20210224_0073.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hRsrac"&gt;Another unique feature of Apple Fitness Plus is — and I apologize for not having a better term here — the &lt;em&gt;vibes&lt;/em&gt;. Peloton instructors approach their rides with a wide range of attitudes and personalities. And while this is also true of Apple’s instructors to some extent, all of them (at least, the cycling and treadmill folks) have vibrantly positive personas. They’re enthusiastic, they’re full of energy, and they’re so excited to be running or biking with you that it’s infectious. It’s hard not to be excited in turn. There was an emphasis on overall wellness — reaching goals, eliminating stress, that sort of thing. I don’t feel like Apple’s instructors are just trying to get me through a workout; I feel like they’re trying to make me a better person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFEi1g"&gt;But the biggest difference between Apple and Peloton’s libraries is that Apple’s is newer — and that means it just doesn’t have as much &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; yet. Peloton has a wider variety of music. I’ve done everything from Bon Jovi rides to yacht-music bike rides, where Apple’s playlists are largely more general (“Everything Rock,” “Latest Hits,” “Latin Grooves,” etc.). And as someone who likes longer endurance workouts, I was disappointed that Apple’s cycling and treadmill workouts are capped at 45 minutes. With Peloton, you can ride for up to 90. Peloton also offers a number of live classes where you can interact with fellow riders, while all of Apple’s workouts are pre-recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hBdTQ"&gt;Another area where Peloton’s ahead is in specific workout hardware integration. Obviously, Apple doesn’t sell a spin bike (yet), and that means the instructors have to be more general about intensity. While Peloton instructors give a specific range (“30 to 50”), Apple instructors speak more generally (“Moderate intensity,” “add a little bit more here,” etc.). This meant I was always kind of guessing where my resistance was supposed to be during Apple’s rides (and I don’t really trust myself to arrive at a legitimately “hard” resistance when asked to find that for myself). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Vt8Lj"&gt;Apple instructors can be more specific with treadmill workouts since metrics like speed and incline are universal. Still, I wish Apple could display the current incline or resistance on the iPad screen like Peloton does. There were times when my teacher instructed everyone to change their resistance while I was zoned out or checking my phone or something, and I ended up doing a portion of the workout at the wrong intensity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY9Gef"&gt;But I think the biggest thing to consider when choosing between Peloton and Apple Fitness Plus is the difficulty. Most of the Fitness Plus workouts I tried are around the same level: a nice challenge for folks like me who work out a few times a week and aren’t super in shape. Peloton caters to a wider variety of abilities, sorted on a scale of 1–10, and you can sort classes by intensity while browsing. If you’re serious about athletic training (and cycling, in particular), Peloton will have more to offer. —&lt;em&gt;Monica Chin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bq3KfwCbGIwu7N_qDYXFPX6DOpg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327715/vpavic_4444_20210224_0079.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PdiGjj"&gt;Time to Walk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nPrX7P"&gt;Working out in one space has always been a struggle for me. I get really bored and uninterested when I’m not actively going somewhere or physically achieving something. I usually exercise by doing loops in a park on my bike, going on a run, or slacklining between trees. So Apple Fitness Plus’ at-home workouts were never of interest to me — until a few weeks ago when Apple rolled out the Time to Walk feature. That is something I, in theory, could get behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BNeLV"&gt;Time to Walk pairs inspirational monologues, music, and photos from famous musicians, athletes, and actors with the Apple Watch’s exercise tracking feature to create a more engaging way to take a walk. I take a walk almost every day and use that time to tune in to a new album or one of my favorite podcasts, so Time to Walk slotted into my routine quite nicely. It’s exactly the level of effortlessness I need in workout tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="d7VKxz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Time to Walk slotted into my routine quite nicely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pQbdnxFksQHqA4gJYX4UXJLVK7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327738/IMG_8514EA04A825_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G365Gy"&gt;There are only a couple of differences between Time to Walk and a more traditional podcast. Most notably, your Watch will buzz about twice an episode, and a photo will show up on the screen that relates to what the host is talking about. It’s cool but not groundbreaking. Secondly, the hosts are either also on a walk or talking about what walking means to them. I appreciated this a bit more. Ruby Bridges’ episode has a slow, calm pace, and you can hear as she strolls through Audubon Park in New Orleans. There are many loud birds and cars driving by in the distance. While Draymond Green’s heavier foot on a gravel path in Malibu is accompanied by the sounds of distant waves. Apple really nailed the soundstage of these walks, and it creates a pleasing experience that actually makes you feel as if you are walking next to someone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sg6kLj"&gt;My only issue with Time to Walk and Apple Fitness Plus at large is the need to live in the Apple ecosystem. You absolutely need an iPhone and Apple Watch to use Fitness Plus, and even outside of that, when you use the Time to Walk feature, your headphones have to be paired to the Apple Watch. If a call comes in on your iPhone and you’re not using Apple or Beats headphones that can switch over automatically, you will have to manually reconnect your headphones to your phone to take the call on them, then manually reconnect your headphones to the Watch to resume the Time to Walk episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwJMJA"&gt;For someone who doesn’t use AirPods, this is very annoying. Outside of the usual Apple ecosystem walls, Time to Walk is my favorite feature of Apple Fitness Plus. Every Monday, when a new episode with a new mystery celeb comes out, I look forward to my nightly walk. Unfortunately, this is the only feature I loved within Apple Fitness Plus, and a walking podcast is not worth $9.99 a month for me. —&lt;em&gt;Becca Farsace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KoJWOTEYvmq9cxlZ5VxwDqOZcxo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327711/vpavic_4444_20210224_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SXXQz9"&gt;If there’s a single message to take away from this review, it’s this: Apple Fitness Plus is great for beginners but may not offer the depth you’re looking for if you’re advanced in any specific sport. It’s accessible to anybody who is able to buy into Apple’s whole ecosystem, though. And for me, a person who has struggled to exercise regularly for my entire life, it’s better than a gym membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rvh08"&gt;There is enough variety for me to feel like I won’t have to put videos on repeat, but I’m only using it a couple of times a week right now. My main complaint has nothing to do with the exercise content but instead with the vibe of Apple’s videos. I’m not asking for disaffected ’90s MTV VJs, but the peppy and relentlessly positive chatter is a lot for a Gen-Xer like me. And the vaguely-but-not-actually spiritualistic “mindfulness” that you can’t avoid in the cooldowns also grates. None of this is new to anybody who has used services like this, but for me, it’s a lot. I cringe when a trainer ends a video by trying to get me excited to “close those rings” on the Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bcBQ2L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Great for beginners, but maybe not deep enough if you already have an exercise routine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kCTRk0"&gt;Still, the best thing I can say about Apple Fitness Plus is, slowly but surely, it is helping me build a habit of actual exercise. There are plenty of days that I end up going outside for a bike ride or a walk instead of turning on an Apple video, but I think doing a couple Fitness Plus videos a week has made it more likely I’ll do that non-Fitness Plus exercise, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxZ3wX"&gt;And while the Apple Watch integration occasionally feels motivational, for the most part, it feels unnecessary. Fitness Plus is not a reason to go out and buy an Apple Watch, but it might be a good reason to keep using the one you’ve already got. As with many of Apple’s new services, it’s less about drawing people in than it is about keeping people from leaving. I’ll probably keep using Fitness Plus simply because it’s part of the big Apple One bundle I got so my family could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21439083/apple-one-music-icloud-tv-plus-arcade-bundle-price-explained-deal-subscription-service"&gt;have an amount of iCloud storage that didn’t feel punitive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xV2646"&gt;If you’re not an Apple One subscriber, is Fitness Plus worth $9.99 / month on its own? If you’re already in an exercise routine, I’m not sure that Fitness Plus is going to offer you something better. For me, it’s literally better than nothing. —&lt;em&gt;Dieter Bohn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple TV’s touchpad swipes and misses at being a good remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SabX-zpnBqRdZwClYeBz2FzeBXs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873060/akrales_210224_4406_0066.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLMbFe"&gt;It’s rare to find a button that is almost universally hated, but the infamous touchpad on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9630952/new-apple-tv-4-review"&gt;Apple TV’s Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; might be the exception. Even over half a decade after its introduction, it stands as one of the most reviled pieces of hardware around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwJD7m"&gt;The failings of the Apple TV remote don’t just stem from a bad touchpad (and don’t get me wrong: it is bad) but from a larger misunderstanding on Apple’s part of what makes a good remote and the fundamental purpose of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvoWpW"&gt;The typical TV remote is big and ugly, but it’s also extremely easy to find and navigate thanks to differing patterns of buttons that make it clear what you’re touching even without checking. Generally speaking, no one has ever been too confused about how to find the giant rubber rocker that says “VOLUME” or what the huge, often glowing red power button does. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLS6K3kwl5u3N2_vz0zI62VUd8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326742/akrales_210224_4406_0053.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bcDXgq"&gt;Apple’s remotes have always been far simpler and smaller, but its older models still had distinct buttons for key features like navigation and controlling playback. And crucially, you could tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LfLoF"&gt;But the so-called Siri Remote broke from those designs when it was introduced alongside the fourth-generation Apple TV in 2015. The new Apple TV featured the biggest revamp of Apple’s set-top box ambitions to date, introducing its tvOS platform, an App Store, and the goal of becoming a one-stop shop for all your TV needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fVaRDb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS-style apps meant an iOS-style control scheme&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zzKoxi"&gt;The remote was designed to complement those ambitions. Most notably, the directional pad was removed and replaced with a featureless touchpad that was meant to more closely emulate the touchscreens found on iPhones and iPads. After all, the Apple TV could run iOS-style apps now, so presumably it needed an iOS-style control scheme to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3Kd2R"&gt;But in its pursuit of emulating the smartphone experience, Apple lost sight of the key elements of a good TV remote. The Siri Remote’s slimmed-down glass and aluminum design looked fantastic. In practice, though, the diminutive remote was even easier to lose than its already small predecessors, with a design that seems to be tailor-made for slipping between couch seats and underneath cushions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DBLrvP6y_4MlyyGfb7NPrHMZ8iQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326745/akrales_210224_4406_0094.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nF9oVk"&gt;The minimalist design stripped the remote down to just just a few buttons, but the virtually symmetrical layout made it nearly impossible to distinguish between those buttons in the dark (say, when watching a movie). Pick up the remote the wrong way, and instead of hitting the play / pause button to stop your show, you might hit the TV button — which boots you out of the show and takes you to Apple’s overstuffed TV app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKfXK2"&gt;Add in software updates that have changed what those buttons actually do (the TV button used to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tv-remote-home-button-changed-by-apple-2019-9#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20pressing%20the%20%22TV,rest%20of%20your%20apps%20live."&gt;work as a home button&lt;/a&gt; until Apple released the TV app in 2019), and it’s another indictment of the remote’s chase of form over function. Even Apple seems to be aware of this: when it refreshed the Siri remote for the fifth-generation Apple TV 4K, it added a white ring to the menu button to make it slightly easier to tell which side is up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvqEWo"&gt;And then there’s the touchpad. With only its matte texture serving to distinguish it from the glossy grip of the remote, it suffers from the same orientation issues as the other buttons. Pick up the remote the wrong way, and you’ll either end up swiping on useless glass when you meant to move around the OS or flinging your way through a show when you meant to just grab the remote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wrMjWx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The touchpad is just plain bad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKPeVA"&gt;Even if you can orient it the right way, the overly sensitive and opaque nature of the touchpad makes it easy to overshoot whatever it was you were trying to do in the first place. In theory, the touchpad is a useful tool for playing games, swiping through pages of apps, and effortlessly panning through a Netflix show. In practice, it’s terrible at nearly all of those tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPEDhE"&gt;The remote is such a problem that when Swiss TV and internet provider Salt started offering Apple TVs as set-top boxes, it worked with Apple to make a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/9/21002605/apple-tv-remote-salt-swiss-tv-company-replacement-buttons-normal"&gt;simpler, more traditional remote control&lt;/a&gt; to offer customers instead. One of the biggest changes is a swap from the touchpad to a regular, rubber D-pad. The touchpad promises limitless functionality, but it’s so hard to use that a &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; versatile input method is actually more useful. (The $20 Salt remotes routinely sell on eBay for nearly triple their value to disgruntled customers in other markets.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WPb0i-Ad_mYulNmI0GmqC4rG5XE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326746/akrales_210224_4406_0105.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1BJpAo"&gt;But for all those issues, the Siri Remote’s failures all stem from a common cause: the smartphone-ification of the traditional TV remote. The svelte design and touchpad interface are things that helped skyrocket the original iPhone to its massive success. But for a TV remote — a device that needs to be easily found in a sea of throw pillows and function simply without requiring that you tear your eyes away from the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; — they’re precisely the wrong traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UB7f1H"&gt;Apple made a remote control that’s an undeniably beautiful piece of hardware. Outside of the Siri Remote, how many TV remotes can claim to actually look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;? But the touchpad’s minimalism and misplaced attempt at trying to turn the entire remote into something that it’s not makes it like other failed Apple buttons before it: a stark warning of the dangers of chasing form over function. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overcast overhauls its Apple Watch app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SXtyWAMsl4ChX8JMzdaDOXkvstQ=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872032/IMG_1337_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kXVs25"&gt;A new update to popular podcast player &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm"&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt; includes a major overhaul of its Apple Watch app. The Apple Watch support is notable at a time when third-party app development for the platform is not necessarily in a great spot, though the Watch itself continues to grow in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EWM1X"&gt;Overcast’s update reorganizes the app UI from top to bottom, adding some features that otherwise were only able to be accessed through the phone version. The main screen has large buttons for settings and syncing above a scrolling list of your shows and access to the “now playing” screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoXK26"&gt;That screen now includes a button on the bottom right that takes you to more detailed info on the podcast and lets you adjust its playback speed, as well as giving you the ability to skip directly through chapters on podcasts that have them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPtCUOTDx-UFlGAdUDAdrx6Ul8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327758/overcast.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ArC1lb"&gt;Release notes for the new iOS version of Overcast, which is dubbed 2021.1, note a couple of extra changes without going into details. Other than the new Watch app, Overcast now has “improved Siri support” and “tons of under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddXyoR"&gt;Overcast is &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857"&gt;available for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and now M1-powered Macs because of their support for running iOS apps. The app is free but ad-supported, with an optional $9.99 subscription that can remove the ads.&lt;/p&gt;
