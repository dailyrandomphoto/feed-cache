    <title>Apple is updating AirTags to make them less creepy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QOSWYvghxFn8weHchD7bXIkdAs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69401765/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQ4Ki1"&gt;Apple is distributing an AirTags software update that makes it harder for people to use them for surreptitious tracking, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-bolsters-airtag-privacy-measures-to-offer-android-detector-app-later-this-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. According to a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple is also working on an app for Android users which will let them detect potentially unwanted trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoHH1q"&gt;AirTags were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as Apple’s solution for helping people keep track of everyday objects. In its marketing, Apple shows people finding their lost keys or bags that have the trackers attached. However, there have been concerns the tiny devices are being used to secretly track people without their knowledge, and we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review/"&gt;numerous reports&lt;/a&gt; since the AirTags’ release indicating that some tweaks were needed to make the devices more privacy-conscious for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B1up2"&gt;Before the update, if AirTags were away from their owner, they would chime &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-airtag-privacy-loopholes"&gt;after three days&lt;/a&gt; if they detected that they were moving. If you had a fully up-to-date iPhone, you might get an “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;AirTag Found Moving With You&lt;/a&gt;” notification &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-thing-about-apples-airtags-is-also-the-scaries-1846786338"&gt;before then&lt;/a&gt; — but un-updated iPhone users and Android users were out of luck until that chime. Apple is now updating the AirTags to chime at some point between eight and 24 hours of separation, significantly reducing how long an AirTag can travel before telling on itself. (Apple didn’t respond to request for comment on the range of times it provided.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQlugy"&gt;Apple says the Android app will be coming “later this year” and will be able to detect both AirTags and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;other Find My network accessories&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Chipolo tracker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFtfZW"&gt;Eight to 24 hours is still a long time to be tracked without knowing, but it’s good to see that Apple is at least starting to address some of people’s concerns. The update is out today and should happen automatically when an AirTag comes into proximity with an iPhone similar to how AirPods silently receive updates, according to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xomul"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satechi’s iPad Pro hub will let you pretend it’s a real desktop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Satechi iPad Pro hub and stand" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w8ifMTdAI2--42QeQ2aq-Za7xxY=/0x0:1883x1255/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69386929/satechihubstand.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complete your minimalist desk setup with this gadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4iZLq6"&gt;The latest gadget from Satechi &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1554062&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=98197&amp;amp;urllink=satechi%2Enet%2Fproducts%2Faluminum%2Dstand%2Dhub%2Dfor%2Dipad%2Dpro%3Fvariant%3D39394193965144&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeNintendoSwitch060321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is both a stand and a USB-C hub&lt;/a&gt; made for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models that have a USB-C charging port, as well as the 2020 iPad Air. It’s $100, and with your tablet wedged into the stand, it should look more like a traditional monitor, so you can keep on pretending it’s an actual desktop replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSDLIb"&gt;Like any hub, it gives you a handful of extra ports for expanding the functionality of your iPad. This one includes an HDMI port capable of outputting 4K at up to 60Hz refresh rate, a USB-A data port, a USB-C PD port with up to 60W of charging power, a headphone jack, and separate slots for an SD and microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BwGoZP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Put macOS on the iPad, you cowards","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gZePXNEZWZtwAdr7scNALtBXRDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22560318/ipaddock.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U4KuKK"&gt;You technically don’t need an iPad to use this hub, as this foldable stand is compatible with other computers, tablets, and phones that have a USB-C port. Satechi does mention, however, that your device needs a USB-C PD port for “full compatibility” with the hub. It lists the last five years of MacBook Pros, the 2018 and 2020 MacBook Air, Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7 and Surface Go, as well as the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Google Pixelbook as viable companions to its hub. Extra compatibility is nice, but if you don’t have an iPad (and thus, no need for the stand component), you can probably find a different USB-C hub that’s no less capable for cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7PP0Y"&gt;If this product seems appealing to you, Satechi is &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1554062&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=98197&amp;amp;urllink=satechi%2Enet%2Fproducts%2Faluminum%2Dstand%2Dhub%2Dfor%2Dipad%2Dpro%3Fvariant%3D39394193965144&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeNintendoSwitch060321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;knocking $20 off the cost through June 6th at midnight PT&lt;/a&gt; when you enter the offer code &lt;strong&gt;IPADPRO &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>For Apple TV Plus to succeed, it has to be everywhere — even Android TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCCa0KZN32lwitIK2S2LLzcnmV8=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69380653/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV Plus logo.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKzcOk"&gt;This week, Apple brought its Apple TV app to many new Android TV devices — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462960/apple-tv-app-nvidia-shield-now-available"&gt;not just the Nvidia Shield&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple was smart to widen that support — the expiration date for free trials of Apple TV Plus is swiftly approaching, with many customers about to see their subscriptions end July 1st. That gives Apple a month to win over Android TV users by letting them watch flagship shows like the earnest and delightful &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen, a show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;whose second season&lt;/a&gt; will premiere near the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz9VYe"&gt;The rollout of the Apple TV app to Android TV OS devices started Monday at 8AM PT, a Google spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As a caveat, the Google spokesperson clarified that support does not extend to third-party operator set-top boxes, so, for example, devices like AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21160860/att-tv-now-available-android-tv-google-assistant-streaming"&gt;Android TV set-top box&lt;/a&gt; probably won’t get Apple TV anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1vnhvI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The rollout does not extend to third-party operator set-top boxes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUmHPI"&gt;That Apple’s finally made its streaming app available across Android TV devices isn’t much of a shocker. The app was previously made available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287905/apple-tv-app-now-available-chromecast-google-tv"&gt;non-Apple devices&lt;/a&gt; like the Chromecast with Google TV and the PlayStation 5, and it’s been on Roku and Fire TV devices since 2019. Some Sony TVs running Android TV and other Vizio models running SmartCast OS additionally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516418/apple-tv-sony-android-now-available-software-update"&gt;received support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-tv-arrives-on-vizio-smartcast-tvs-1845006293"&gt;for the app&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNTqHY"&gt;But it’s also not entirely shocking for a company banking heavily on its services offerings. Apple seems to have figured out somewhere along the way that it needed to play nice with other device makers if it wanted to grow Apple TV Plus subscriptions in any meaningful way. With some &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/apple-services-revenue-tops-16-9-billion-4175371/"&gt;660 million paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; across its services as of April, Apple TV Plus’ &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1136261/number-of-apple-tv-plus-subscribers-us/"&gt;estimated 40 million&lt;/a&gt; U.S. subscribers is a small but certainly not insignificant slice of that pie — but that figure could quickly change come July when those users will have to decide whether Apple’s shows are worth paying for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeoJ1w"&gt;Apple launched its service back in 2019 with an astonishingly meager lineup of originals. Sure, they were high-caliber productions with big-name talent and directors at the helm. And sure, some of them were even good! (M. Night Shyamalan’s bizarre psychological thriller &lt;em&gt;Servant&lt;/em&gt; is one such example.) But Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394404/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-july-2021-ted-lasso-second-season-timing"&gt;extended its lengthy free trials&lt;/a&gt; of the service that it offered to users who purchased its devices, and that trial period is very nearly about to end for some of the earliest users to hop on the freebie train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TqZDcA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is about to face a subscriber reckoning&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RrhWAa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; — which Tim Cook has &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/apple-services-revenue-tops-16-9-billion-4175371/"&gt;cited as being a critical success&lt;/a&gt; for the platform — will, again, release its second season toward the end of next month. But for some Apple users, their free trials to Apple TV Plus end July 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8ywqr"&gt;In other words, Apple’s dangling a content carrot in front of its most loyal users in hopes that they’ll stick around and hand over their money. But with so many other services available at present, it’s unclear whether that’ll be enough to make them stay. In fact, research MoffettNathanson &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-freeloader-problem-percent-free-1234890385/"&gt;estimated earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 30 percent of Apple TV Plus subscribers did not plan to resubscribe following their trial periods. While $5 per month isn’t too much for a premium service comparatively speaking, it does start to add up when people are counting all the subscriptions they fork out money for each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBijHS"&gt;Because Apple’s entire plan for the service is to be a hub for either its own in-house productions — or exclusively attained feature films like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21264009/tom-hanks-greyhound-apple-tv-plus-streaming-sony-pictures-pandemic"&gt;Tom Hanks’ &lt;em&gt;Greyhound&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — that means the company has some catching up to do to reach anything close to the library scale of most of its peers, particularly considering it’s about to start making people pay for the service. Making it available across Android TV devices hooked up in users’ homes is a good way to prepare for this change. Plus, especially accounting for the pandemic, who on earth wants to watch an entire feature film on a palm-sized iPhone when they can watch it on the biggest screen in their home instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjWM4U"&gt;It’s almost as if Apple realized that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-never-made-imessage-for-android-to-lock-in-ios-us-1846650480"&gt;doing things the Apple way&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t going to be a successful model for competing in the streaming wars. And while the service is late to the party in terms of accessibility across platforms — it has taken far too long for this app to arrive on more Android TV devices, in my opinion — it was a necessary move for Apple TV Plus’s success in the long run. As long-trialed subscribers discover they’ll suddenly need to pay for Apple’s content, the churn is going to burn.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple asks staff to return to office three days a week starting in early September </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lLQ2WHLpEs-9flnsbZB5C7U9Hn8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69380177/acastro_190322_1777_apple_streaming_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q0JJHI"&gt;Apple employees are being asked to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Tim Cook sent out an email Wednesday informing staff of the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PODrP"&gt;“For all that we’ve been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other,” he said. “Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sgrpkz"&gt;Cook said that most employees will be asked to come in to the office on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, with the option of working remotely on Wednesdays and Fridays. Teams that need to work in-person will return four to five days a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnaG3Q"&gt;Employees also have the chance to work remotely for up to two weeks a year, “to be closer to family and loved ones, find a change of scenery, manage unexpected travel, or a different reason all your own,” according to the letter. Managers need to approve remote work requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLkk8F"&gt;The change is not entirely unexpected for Apple staff. While employees have worked remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, the company famously discouraged working from home prior to 2020. In December, Tim Cook told employees they could be asked to come back to the office as early as June, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/apple-encourages-staff-to-get-vaccinated-offers-paid-time-off?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xbt1dK"&gt;Apple’s stance on remote work, while getting more relaxed, is still conservative compared to the other tech giants. In May, Google announced that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/google-relaxes-remote-work-plan-will-let-20percent-of-employees-telecommute.html"&gt;20 percent of its workforce would be able to work from home permanently&lt;/a&gt;. Mark Zuckerberg has said that remote work “is the future,” and told Facebook employees they can all work from home forever, so long as they get their manager’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYLBVR"&gt;In the letter Wednesday, Cook also encouraged all employees to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZawd9"&gt;“For now, let me simply say that I look forward to seeing your faces,” he said in closing. “I know I’m not alone in missing the hum of activity, the energy, creativity and collaboration of our in-person meetings and the sense of community we’ve all built.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1Ly2l"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Card outage has been resolved after five hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4n0npO9Hc_laGzjqgNIRTMSivI=/201x0:2349x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377427/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.49.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QPBOUA"&gt;The Apple Card experienced an outage on Wednesday that reportedly affected users’ ability to make payments, manage their cards, and see recent transactions, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fsystemstatus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F2%2F22465000%2Fapple-card-outage-cant-make-payments-recent-transactions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s status page&lt;/a&gt;. Interruption in service appears to have started at 6:17AM PT today and lasted for a little over five hours, ending at 12:19PM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2J5kgD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18277417/apple-pay-credit-card-announcement-goldman-sachs-event-2019"&gt;Apple’s credit card solution&lt;/a&gt; is managed almost entirely through the built-in Wallet app in iOS, where users can pay off their credit card bill, see recent transactions, and make payments through Apple Pay. Apple said that all users were affected by today’s outage, but it wasn’t clear if every user experienced all of the possible issues the company reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jd8AY4"&gt;My colleague Mitchell Clark was able to pay off a portion of their bill and see the transaction show up in the Wallet app during the outage, so it’s possible the issues were slowly fixed over time, or never as widespread as Apple warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCZcu2"&gt;Apple never provided comment on the actual size or scope of the problem, but the status page says the issues is resolved, and you should be able to use your card like normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1n6ui"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 2nd, 2:25PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information about Apple Card usage and updated the duration of the outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YB8vd6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 2nd, 4:34PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the outage has ended.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge dismisses charges against Apple chief accused of bribing police officers with iPads </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q4CY76"&gt;A Californian court has dismissed bribery charges against Apple’s Chief Security Officer Thomas Moyer, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/judge-dismisses-charges-against-apple-security-chief-gun-permit-probe-2021-06-01/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, who was accused of offering iPads as bribes to obtain concealed-weapons permits for Apple employees. Judge Eric S. Geffon dismissed arguments of corrupt intent as “pure speculation” that were “not supported by the evidence presented to the grand jury.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bViO1M"&gt;Moyer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611525/apple-ipads-bribes-concealed-gun-permits-security-head-accused-santa-clara"&gt;accused last November&lt;/a&gt; of trying to bribe Santa Clara County officials by offering to donate 200 iPads to two officers in the sheriff’s office following a meeting in 2019. Moyer had indeed made the offer, but evidence suggests he believed the permits were already approved at this time, Judge Geffon wrote. This, combined with the fact that Moyer followed Apple’s rules about donations and was donating the iPads to the Sheriff’s Office rather than the officers themselves, was seen as further evidence against him acting with corrupt intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YFUwyq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple dropped its plans to donate the computers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OjCdg8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/article/Bribery-charge-against-Apple-executive-who-16218024.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple halted plans to donate the computers to the Sheriff’s Office following media reports about the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qWX9t"&gt;In a statement reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Moyer thanked the court for its decision. “I also want to thank Apple, my friends and family for their unwavering support,” he added. Last November, Apple &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/11/apple-security-chief-maintains-innocence-after-bribery-charges/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that an internal investigation had found no wrongdoing. Moyer has reportedly been at Apple for around 15 years, and has served as its global security head since November 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjjyWL"&gt;Despite the bribery charges being dismissed, Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen said prosecutors believed Moyer had been “correctly indicted... for bribery.” Rosen said they “stand by the grand jury’s decision and are evaluating our options.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Brandon Widder? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxqaVYEE4fsxe0IbKH_ZhXy-FsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69371542/bwidder_20210524_4602_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some great tech, along with a mood light and a bobcat skull&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="myZQWm"&gt;As we slowly emerge from the pandemic, many companies are figuratively shaking themselves off, taking stock, and hiring for new types of positions. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is no different; it has recently hired Brandon Widder to be its senior commerce editor, a brand-new title for our next chapter. We asked Brandon if we could take a look at his home workspace, and this is what he showed (and told) us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUN2DR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCcGks"&gt;Great question! I recently started at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; as its first senior commerce editor. As of right now, I’m fixated on improving our deals, buying guides, gift guides, and any other type of content with commerce potential. If it’s an article with a product recommendation — laptop, headset, what have you — there’s a good chance I’ll be looking at it at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS9BuS"&gt;Before starting at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, I worked a number of years helming similar types of evergreen content for &lt;em&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/em&gt;, another consumer tech site. I also used to routinely freelance for an alt-weekly in Portland, Oregon, where I currently live with my partner and our two cats. I mostly wrote about local and touring bands, with some outdoorsy stuff sprinkled in here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Louise Desk Chair came with the territory" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WquN_swIvQSkYuN3uQquY-gs1WM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545811/bwidder_20210525_4602_0031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Louise Desk Chair came with the territory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Yq9qo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Go5A3e"&gt;Well, “decide” is a strong word. My partner and I were forced to work from home as a result of the pandemic. We feel extremely fortunate that we were able to do so, but we didn’t have a dedicated space for us both to work in the beginning. Fortunately, when the unexpected desk shortage of 2020 subsided, I was able to set one up in the corner of our guest room, directly next to the window where I could watch the rain. It’s small and probably doesn’t have much in the way of feng shui, but, honestly, I enjoy how cozy it is. Space is overrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YB8lZ4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vueHiE"&gt;The desk is the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13720150?sid=VergeWOYDBrandonWidder052821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wayfair.com%2Ffurniture%2Fpdp%2Fcorrigan-studio-munguia-desk-w005270388.html%3Fpiid%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Munguia Desk&lt;/a&gt; from Wayfair. I actually didn’t pick it out... let’s just say I inherited it when my partner and I traded work spaces at home. As much as it pains me to admit it, I do like it, namely because it’s relatively sturdy and affords me just the right amount of cubby space. It’s not particularly wide, but it also has a single drawer where I can stash my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and all the cables I probably should have thrown away a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fAuQVY"&gt;
&lt;div id="6YIjzq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523553"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XN9dnD"&gt;
&lt;p id="3JgJqR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And how about your desk chair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hSp14"&gt;Like my desk, the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13720150?sid=VergeWOYDBrandonWidder052821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wayfair.com%2Ffurniture%2Fpdp%2Fkelly-clarkson-home-louise-task-chair-w003318245.html%3Fpiid%3D6833205" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Louise Desk Chair&lt;/a&gt; came with the territory when I took over the office. We were looking for something to match the brass guest bed shoved into the corner of the room, and despite it being a little too glam for my taste, it’s extremely comfortable and meshes well with the rest of the decor. Apparently, it’s “hand-curated by Kelly Clarkson,” which is something I just figured out while looking at the product listing. I just wish it could tilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3joQN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a rather simple setup compared to some of your Verge compatriots. Could you tell us a bit about your tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu8ixG"&gt;Clutter can really get to me, so I try to keep things clean. For work, I use the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=macbook%2Bair&amp;amp;qid=1622050268&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyM080VVhUVVMzOVI4JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzg5NDQ0MVpLT0syNVFOSUVLTiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzg4MDE1MkREMVpISEc0MjdXTSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, but you wouldn’t know it given that it’s housed in the cubby beneath my desk. It’s a great machine, one that Dieter and the team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;have already gushed over&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q5n9JV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="helivd"&gt;On the peripheral front, I recently sprung for the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeWOYDBrandonWidder052821/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-monitor-u2720q/apd/210-avjv/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell UltraSharp U2720Q&lt;/a&gt;, a fantastic 4K display that affords me a bit more screen real estate than the Air and simultaneously charges my laptop via USB-C. I also have Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Keyboard-Wireless-Rechargable-English/dp/B016QO64FI/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=magic+keyboard&amp;amp;qid=1622050179&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyS0U3TVVLV0ZLRVU4JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzIzNTUxMUdaMVIzTkFMQ0JUWSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODExNjA2MU5OSjIzVEtLSlRVOCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Trackpad-Wireless-Rechargable/dp/B07BRF3ZQD/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2B9L8DKHKSWGV&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=magic%2Btrackpad%2B2&amp;amp;qid=1622050188&amp;amp;sprefix=magic%2Btrack%2Caps%2C240&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Magic Trackpad 2&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve never been a huge fan of desktop mice, so when I picked up an external monitor, the trackpad just made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtLJmN"&gt;Elsewhere on my desk, I have one of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756Z8X82/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s wireless Qi charging pads&lt;/a&gt; for my iPhone X and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-One-Gen-Controlled-Built/dp/B07NJPXRBC?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos One&lt;/a&gt;. I listen to everything from political post-punk to the gorgeous instrumental work of Icelandic composer Ólafur Arnalds, but everything in the Sonos lineup really shines regardless of the genre. I’m a sucker for the entire ecosystem, especially given its simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t1pfow"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pGNfZ8"&gt;
&lt;p id="DMjQoQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about the interesting wood piece that you have on your desk. And the — jawbone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dw7rIz"&gt;When I’m not working, I tend to spend a lot of time outside. I love hiking and backpacking, and I’m really involved with Pacific Northwest Search and Rescue, one of our local SAR outfits. The driftwood is from the shores of the San Juan Islands; the rock from a small peak in Sun Valley, Idaho. My fascination with the natural world extends to bones — morbid, I know — which is why I have a bobcat skull sitting on my desk. It’s a bit in shambles at this point, though, having succumbed to my cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bobcat skull, a little worse for wear" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NtF_Fjf0Ie_S2hO50K4qPa9vW6A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545809/bwidder_20210524_4602_0026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A bobcat skull, a little worse for wear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Driftwood from the shores of the San Juan Islands" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CpKRnx1-G5ohKGZtpHnXKjvASMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545803/bwidder_20210524_4602_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Driftwood from the shores of the San Juan Islands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Mood lighting for the home office" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3qqAoK2cCTNt1CPoY1Scmr_cgFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545802/bwidder_20210524_4602_0015_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mood lighting for the home office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WNfnpc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m fascinated by the old-fashioned lightbulb you have next to the plant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gsotu5"&gt;That would be my so-called mood lighting. There’s a small-ish company out of Portland called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgrovemade.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22458437%2Fhome-office-desk-macbook-dell-brandon-widder-tech-editor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Grovemade&lt;/a&gt;, which manufactures an assortment of desk accessories out of wood and leather. Most of them run on the pricey side, but the quality is great. I picked up the now-discontinued walnut lamp a few years back and, more recently, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgrovemade.com%2Fproduct%2Fleather-desk-pad%2F%3Finitial%3D547&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22458437%2Fhome-office-desk-macbook-dell-brandon-widder-tech-editor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;leather pad&lt;/a&gt; on which my keyboard and trackpad rest. It’s basically me trying to bring more natural elements into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujGaCb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you have a notebook and pen by your keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtFMpO"&gt;Yes! Like most people at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, I probably have more spreadsheets and Google Docs than I care to admit. The notebook allows me to jot down quick notes and keep them close at hand. It also just feels really good to physically write every once in a while, which is something I think a lot of us can appreciate. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V5SQ6Q2/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;aaxitk=85a771eb1a014108995c19f32725f01c&amp;amp;hsa_cr_id=2895318650401&amp;amp;pd_rd_plhdr=t&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=2921f872-3cff-4acd-bcce-35efdaaf6aef&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=Mpdtv&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=kYtdu&amp;amp;ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_mcd_asin_2_img&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Field Notes&lt;/a&gt; are great because they come in all shapes and sizes, some of which are waterproof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5zY00"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else about your work space that we haven’t covered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErgenS"&gt;Not really! The only other thing worth noting is my backlighting, which, if you live in an area that gets as much rain as I do, is crucial during the wetter months. For me, I’ve found the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QV9XB87/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue color lightbulbs&lt;/a&gt; to work best, partly because I’m tapped into the Hue network. If I want bright lights for a Zoom call or something more moody for after-hours work, all I have to do is say the word to Alexa. It’s super convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EEcMoD"&gt;Also, go read &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Makes-Me-Modern-Girl/dp/0399184767/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=carrie+brownstein&amp;amp;qid=1622050875&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Carrie Brownstein’s autobiography&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Leopard-Wolf-Dark-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B07DP5W1LT/ref=sr_1_1?crid=LCC3B8H6JIMM&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=black+leopard+red+wolf&amp;amp;qid=1622050899&amp;amp;sprefix=black+leap%2Caps%2C244&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Leopard, Red Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Marlon James, both of which are sitting on my desk at the moment. You won’t be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGHj9F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBEhEE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV app comes to Nvidia Shield</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BrmdMSUmEmfe5XeeI4AfSn-_QU8=/130x0:1150x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69371440/Apple_TV_on_SHIELD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Apple TV app on Shield. | Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JTbS6V"&gt;Apple’s streaming TV app is coming to another platform today: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia’s Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Shield owners will &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/06/01/shield-apple-TV/"&gt;now be able to access&lt;/a&gt; Apple TV Plus, rent movies through Apple’s store, and access subscriptions to premium channels like Showtime and Starz that were set up through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TC3WbI"&gt;The biggest hook is finally getting access to Apple TV Plus. Apple needs the streaming service to be accessible in as many places as possible in order to expand viewership. And viewers need to be able to access the service on whatever device is hooked up to their TV, if Apple wants to make sure people use it and stay signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJxtSG"&gt;Apple TV Plus is already available through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-tv-app%2Fdevices%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F1%2F22462960%2Fapple-tv-app-nvidia-shield-now-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many of the most popular&lt;/a&gt; streaming devices. It’s offered through Roku and Fire TV streaming devices, available on recent PlayStations and Xboxes, and supported on many Vizio, Sony, Samsung, and LG TVs. The app came to Google’s latest Chromecast in February, and it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287905/apple-tv-app-now-available-chromecast-google-tv"&gt;supposed to expand to other Android TV devices&lt;/a&gt; — like the Shield — sometime after that. The service will support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos on Shield devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8OVrH"&gt;The timing is good for Apple. Free trials for Apple TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394404/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-july-2021-ted-lasso-second-season-timing"&gt;are about to lapse&lt;/a&gt; for the service’s earliest users. And the second season of the service’s biggest (and pretty much only) hit, &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;debuts July 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. The more places Apple TV Plus can be accessed, the better odds Apple has of getting some actual paying subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n0NyLH"&gt;Apple is delaying the launch of its upcoming Podcasts subscriptions until June, the company announced in an email sent to creators Friday (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/28/apple-delaying-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-until-june-promises-improvements-to-podcasts-app/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The service was previously set to launch this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjbNaY"&gt;Apple’s Podcasts subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;will allow people&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to participating podcasts to get extra perks like ad-free listening or early access to episodes. In April, Apple said the subscriptions would launch in 170 countries, and that initial partners include Pushkin Industries and NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq5QCY"&gt;The shifted launch comes as some creators using Apple Podcasts &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/article/apple-podcasts-lemon-bugs?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-05-28"&gt;have recently run into some issues&lt;/a&gt;, such as being unable to log in to Apple’s Podcast Connect portal or seeing a delay in the availability of new episodes. In its email sent Friday, Apple said it has fixed the “disruptions” that presented problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7UXzb"&gt;You can read Apple’s full email to creators below, which the company shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ka4avf"&gt;We’re writing to provide an update on the availability of Apple Podcasts Subscriptions and channels. We’ve been delighted by the response to last month’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22459129%2Fapple-delays-podcasts-subscriptions-june" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; and it’s exciting to see the hundreds of new subscriptions and channels submitted from creators across the globe every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvdhoL"&gt;To ensure we are delivering the best experience for creators and listeners, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions and channels will now launch in June. We will communicate further updates on availability, and best practices to help you prepare your subscriptions and channels, through this newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nna6d5"&gt;Over the last few weeks, some creators have experienced delays in the availability of their content and access to Apple Podcasts Connect. We’ve addressed these disruptions and encourage creators experiencing any issues to &lt;a href="https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/contactus"&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LY27Uc"&gt;We’ve also heard from listeners and made adjustments based on their feedback with iOS 14.6, which was released on Monday. We will introduce additional enhancements to Library in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCvcwF"&gt;Thank you for your understanding. We can’t wait to see your new subscriptions and channels and we are looking forward to launching them to listeners around the world soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The AirPods Pro’s force sensor is a more comfortable way to control audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwoxfJvKR8bfojMWh8jqAzd5gvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69356058/vpavic_4603_20210525_0018_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WjhY2z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; cleverly solve one of the trickiest parts of earbud design with a unique button — even if it’s not technically a button at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKi4jL"&gt;Officially referred to as the “force sensor” (a title that makes the button sound far more interesting than it actually is), it’s technically nothing more than an indented portion of the AirPods Pro’s stems, with some fancy hardware that measures not just capacitive touch but also pressure. But the faux-buttons solve one of the most annoying things about earbuds: how to control them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SSF7c8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A smart solution for a more recent problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wF9nN8"&gt;The issue of controlling truly wireless earbuds is a relatively new one. Older in-ear headphones often included a row of buttons on their wires, which allowed for volume and playback controls to be placed in a spot that’s easy to reach and find. But in-ear wireless earbuds don’t leave a lot of space for buttons, joysticks, or control wheels to manipulate playback, forcing manufacturers to come up with alternate solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ry-XASBpDsHpD2CY_IGMMPv1QD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539213/vpavic_4603_20210525_0020_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hQSlsa"&gt;Touch controls, employed by headphones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;regular AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, have emerged as the most common answer. Tap, double tap, or triple tap your earbuds, and you’ll be able to play, pause, and skip around your tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAjnnr"&gt;The problem, though, is that in-ear headphones — as the name suggests — are already nestled pretty firmly into your ear. And tap controls mean that you’re either shoving those earbuds further into your ear (painfully so, sometimes) or dislodging them entirely, at which point you’re risking loss or damage when your expensive buds plummet to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uv9w0A"&gt;Apple avoids both of those problems with the force sensor. Instead of putting pressure on your ear, Apple has users squeeze the stem of the AirPod. It’s a far gentler movement that doesn’t move the earbud as much, reducing both the risk of discomfort and dislodging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyBe0o_QmVvM29cY0XkZl66-nVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539210/vpavic_4603_20210525_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EOET2D"&gt;Its controls are pretty similar to the other methods of headphone control: one squeeze to toggle play / pause, two to skip forward a track, and three to skip back. There’s also a fourth long press, which toggles the various noise cancellation modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0W4DZ"&gt;The whole design guides you through how to use them, too. The indented pad makes it clear where to press to activate the “button,” while the requirement for some slight force makes it hard to trigger unintentionally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD1kZh"&gt;And while there’s no &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; haptic feedback from the force sensor, Apple does some masterful work in tricking your brain that there is, through clever clicking sound effects relayed through the earbuds to make it feel like you’re pressing a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ga9LqW"&gt;The controls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458155/new-airpods-pro-2022-fitness-release-dates-report-design-features"&gt;might not be long for this world&lt;/a&gt; — Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022"&gt;rumored to be testing a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro that would remove the stem (and the force sensor) entirely. It’d be a disappointing change, given that the force sensor isn’t just a great control method; the AirPod stems are one of the more recognizable parts of the product, so much so that it’s the main thing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435637/us-cbp-counterfeit-airpods-oneplus-buds-mixup"&gt;copycat designs&lt;/a&gt; tend to replicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhNoli"&gt;Is it a lot of engineering work for a relatively simple function? Undoubtedly. But it makes a crucial part of operating the AirPods a seamless, aesthetically pleasing, and comfortable process. And what more can you ask than that?&lt;/p&gt;
