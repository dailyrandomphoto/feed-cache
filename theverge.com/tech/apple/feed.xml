    <title>T-Mobile is giving customers a free year of Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiC77TNwBUp-4F-OVSyfPk0hggo=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763688/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020106.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0n2u1d"&gt;T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Ft-mobile-apple-tv-on-us&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a new promotional perk&lt;/a&gt; for its customers: starting on August 25th, both new and existing subscribers to its Magenta and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max&lt;/a&gt; plans can get a year’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscription to Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGx288"&gt;The deal applies to virtually any of T-Mobile’s post-paid customers that it classifies as part of those plans, including its Magenta 55 Plus, Magenta Military, Magenta First Responders, Sprint Unlimited Plus, Sprint Premium, and T-Mobile for Business plans. Better yet, the deal isn’t just for newcomers to T-Mobile; it seems that anyone subscribing to those plans can get the free year of Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tew1Ky"&gt;Customers under T-Mobile’s Magenta, Magenta Max, and T-Mobile for Business can find the offer listed under their rate plan details on T-Mobile’s website or app to get the free year, while customers who are still under Sprint’s umbrella will have to go to T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promotional site&lt;/a&gt; and apply the code 2021APPLETVP1 to get the offer. (Regular T-Mobile customers can do that, too, should they prefer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nGr6x0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Watch ‘Foundation’ for free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKhcRS"&gt;T-Mobile also notes that the free 12 months on offer here will seemingly apply even if you’ve had a subscription or trial to Apple TV Plus before, meaning that customers can stack the deal with other free trials, like the three months of service that come with the purchase of a new Apple device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96944Y"&gt;The freebie also comes as T-Mobile is reckoning with its recent massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, which exposed data for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;millions of its customers&lt;/a&gt;, including first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license / ID numbers, phone numbers, and IMEI / IMSI information for 7.8 million postpaid customers. Additionally, T-Mobile says that data on over 40 million “former or prospective customers” was compromised in the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6kuAz"&gt;And while it’s certainly a nice bonus for customers, it’s likely that a few months of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;will not make up for having to deal with the ramifications of having that much personal data leaked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Higher-end Mac Mini reportedly landing ‘in the next several months’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vepgj9"&gt;Apple is planning a new model of the Mac Mini that will replace the pro-focused Intel-based model it still sells, according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman’s &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter. A “high-end, M1X Mac Mini” is expected “in the next several months,” and is said to have “an updated design and more ports than the current model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itZkyK"&gt;Apple released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini with its own M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; late last year, but that model was intended as a replacement for the entry-level machines, and consequently had fewer ports than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18097117/apple-mac-mini-2018-review-upgrade-faster-more-powerful-features-price"&gt;higher-end Intel version introduced in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The M1 Mini has two fewer Thunderbolt ports, only one of which can be used for an external display, although a second monitor can still be hooked up over HDMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XvKJ1U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Mac mini with M1 review: over-performer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="us03Zf"&gt;If the “M1X” nomenclature is accurate, it would suggest that the new model uses the same generation CPU cores as the M1 (and the A14 Bionic chip used in the iPhone 12), but achieves better performance by having more CPU and GPU cores across a larger chip. That was Apple’s approach to designing the “X” processors for previous iPad models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SM0LFU"&gt;The current M1 Mac Mini is a great computer, but it does have its limitations for pro use, and there’s a sense that its design — virtually unchanged since 2010 — could use an overhaul. Gurman has mentioned the prospect of a new Mac Mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, and he now seems surer than ever that it’s actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is $75 off at Amazon and Walmart today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="There’s a new “artist” watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WlKaRYOICMCEw8jZdmFYJmXSaA4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69756933/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;This weekend, it’s not just the red Apple Watch Series 6 getting a discount. | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LV8f67"&gt;The red Apple Watch Series 6 has already seen an array of big discounts, but you don’t always get nice pricing on the more subtle colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are both currently offering $75 off the handsome navy-colored watch, as well as the white model, bringing them down to $325. Walmart also has a few more colors available at the same price, and both offer the red at an additional $6 markdown. In addition to a myriad of fun colors, Apple’s latest and greatest wearable also offers built-in sleep tracking, a blood oxygen sensor, and an always-on display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qigDsv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2Eaty"&gt;Amazon and Google may be paving the way toward a smarter home, but not every device under the sun touts smart capabilities yet. Luckily, there are devices like TP-Link’s Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini. The simple, voice-enabled device works with virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as IFTTT, giving you an easy way to control your plugs via Wi-Fi and set a schedule. Normally $18, you can grab TP-Link’s compact smart plug at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749634942986522554" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ftp-link-wifi-mini-smart%2F-%2FA-52107189" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target for $10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YUqPyP"&gt;If you own a PlayStation 4 or the PlayStation 5, a subscription to PlayStation Plus is really a no-brainer. The premium service grants you access to online multiplayer, free monthly titles, and 100GB of cloud storage, along with exclusive deals on select games, add-ons, and preorders. It also lets you take advantage of the PlayStation Plus collection, a catalog that contains some of the best PlayStation games to date, including hits such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17223854/god-of-war-review-ps4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Remastered&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/3/8339241/bloodborne-is-a-blood-soaked-bone-splintering-masterpiece-on-ps4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Best of all, if you’re a new subscriber, you can land a 12-month subscription to &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/IP9101-NPIA90005_01-PSPLUSDIS50OFF1Y/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus for just $30&lt;/a&gt; through August 30th, half off what it would typically cost for Sony’s landmark service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z4jXiS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ClAtmV"&gt;We’ve been tracking this deal on the AirPods Pro — the best one since Black Friday — for a few days now. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are still offering $70 off a new set of the popular noise-canceling earbuds, bringing the final sale price down to $180. Not only are the true wireless earbuds built around the Apple-designed H1 chip, which gives them always-on support for Siri, but they feature great noise cancellation and deep integration with iOS, adding to their convenience. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zFkH7N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="juoMF5"&gt;To celebrate &lt;em&gt;Quake’s&lt;/em&gt; 25th anniversary and the game’s wider release on consoles, Steam is offering big discounts on many great games as part of its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/bethesda/sale/quakecon2021?snr=1_4_4__118" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QuakeCon sale&lt;/a&gt;. You can currently take your pick from a plethora of solid titles, including entries from the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Dishonored franchises, though, personally, we recommend the modern Doom titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yevur5"&gt;The widely beloved &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 2016 title responsible for ripping and tearing the classic franchise back from the brink of potential obscurity, is just $5 (50 percent off). Last year’s sequel, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is $15 (75 percent off), and even &lt;em&gt;Eternal’s&lt;/em&gt; two DLC expansions, &lt;em&gt;The Ancient Gods&lt;/em&gt; Parts &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098292/DOOM_Eternal_The_Ancient_Gods__Part_One/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098293/DOOM_Eternal_The_Ancient_Gods__Part_Two/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, are 50 percent off or available together for $15 as the &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098291/DOOM_Eternal_Year_One_Pass/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Year One Pass&lt;/a&gt;. That is a ton of collective hours of fast-action, FPS chaos for cheap. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doom Eternal &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZYqwTfbX2vk4FqDWTzaFfIYSDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/vpavic_200805_4131_0086_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="J5m9NK"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWFA5k"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JHLP0"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s well over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people. While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gY4Mp"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; is our top choice right now. You won’t find a big, show-stopping screen here, or bells and whistles like a fast refresh rate screen. Instead, you get a phone that covers the basics really well, plus IP67 waterproofing and timely software updates — all at a lower price than last year’s model.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wu38Dv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556638"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2Gej3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711280"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bkDOPH"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZnehD"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, and you definitely won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOgwn4"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5TvHua"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tETMb0"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAfzxG"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB1ZXR"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A’s 6.34-inch screen isn’t huge, but it’s just big enough to not look out of place next to the 6.5-inch competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B9aQm4"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best budget Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VAnoi0"&gt;The $449 Pixel 5A features a 6.34-inch OLED screen that’s on the smaller side for the budget class, but it’s bigger than the previous-gen 6.2-inch panel on the Pixel 4A 5G. There’s a bigger battery too, a 4,680mAh cell that will last through a full day of heavy use and well into day two if you’re a lighter user. The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance for added peace of mind in the event of accidental spills or tumbles into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMgcHa"&gt;That’s more or less the extent of the 5A’s improvements over its predecessor, and that’s fine. The 4A 5G was already a well-equipped midrange device and the 5A makes some strategic updates to its foundation. The dual standard / ultrawide rear-facing camera, Snapdragon 765G processor, and 6GB RAM / 128GB storage combination served the 4A 5G well and still deliver solid performance in this iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hdocxa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release — it’s only available in the US and Japan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iQBwQn"&gt;Another thing we can count on Pixel phones to do well is software, and the 5A is no exception. It ships with Google’s own Android 11 OS and is refreshingly free of the added clutter that other manufacturers sometimes pile onto it. The Pixel 5A is also guaranteed three years of OS platform upgrades and security updates, which isn’t quite as long as Apple or Samsung’s standard software support timespan, but is certainly better than a lot of the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQGX8e"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity. You won’t get the super-fast mmWave flavor of 5G support, but that’s a highly range-limited network that’s still pretty hard to find. That’s fine, but there’s a weird question mark over whether Google will support another set of frequencies that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will start using later this year called C-band. The company isn’t committing to making the necessary software update to use it, despite supporting it in hardware. It’s a strange blemish on the 5A’s otherwise strong feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHUScD"&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release — it’s only available in the US and Japan, and isn’t being sold through any of the major US wireless carriers. Taking all of that into consideration, the Pixel 5A is still the inexpensive Android phone that we’d recommend to most people. It’s not flashy, but it’s well priced and has it where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7CPw9a"&gt;The best budget Android phone with a fast refresh-rate screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GW6KVJ"&gt;On the Android side, the Galaxy A52 5G is a great option, albeit at the very top of the price range considered in this guide. It includes some features that aren’t too common in a budget phone, like its fast-refresh rate screen, an IP67 water resistance rating, and for now at least, monthly security updates for fast access to bug fixes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s379P4"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIaTf"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating is handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RSNCy0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if you want to make an investment in a phone that you can keep using years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwHMHO"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright-spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 4A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFmNNo"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nCclP5"&gt;The best “get it while you can” affordable Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Uc3Oon"&gt;If you want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt; Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, lacks 5G support, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349 but you’ll have to act fast if you want one — with the Pixel 5A and Pixel 6 debuting this fall, Google won’t be selling the 4A for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huw9Ph"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera. It’s based on generation-old technology at this point, but it’s still the best in this class and it can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g65TGg"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrF1h5"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it, putting you first in line for Android updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XggNCE"&gt;Unfortunately, in a little over a year’s time, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be slowing down. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7VV1d"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for well under $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal — while you can still find it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 covers the essentials with a couple of nice touches, like a 90Hz screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Oj4ljX"&gt;A great midrange option if you’re outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hMRHe3"&gt;The OnePlus Nord 2 isn’t sold in the US, and that’s our loss because this follow-up to the original Nord checks all the right boxes for its £399 / €399 price. Even more so than last year’s model, the Nord 2 feels like a pared-down flagship that covers all of the basics well, with (almost) nothing that you don’t need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8pZjK"&gt;The Nord 2 offers a 6.43-inch display with 90Hz refresh rate — a bit faster than the standard 60Hz, but not quite the buttery smoothness of a 120Hz screen. We were a little apprehensive of the MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI chipset that OnePlus has opted for in favor of proven Snapdragon processors, but in testing, it was more than adequate for daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfaweu"&gt;The 4,500mAh battery will comfortably get you through a full day’s use, and although there’s no wireless charging included (not a surprise at this price), OnePlus’ signature fast wired charging is supported. With the included charger, you can power the phone from zero to fully charged in well under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZKaIkM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Nord 2 ships with OxygenOS 11.3, and is the uncluttered, unfussy experience we’ve come to expect from OnePlus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xdTWar"&gt;OnePlus’ unfussy UI is another strong point. The Nord 2 ships with OxygenOS 11.3, and is the uncluttered, unfussy experience we’ve come to expect from OnePlus. The company says it will offer two OS upgrades and three years of security support for the Nord 2, which is a good, if not great update policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir7jlU"&gt;You won’t find the Hasselblad branding of the OnePlus 9 flagships on the Nord 2’s cameras, and that’s no great loss. What you do get is a capable camera system consisting of a 50-megapixel main stabilized rear camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a questionably useful 2-megapixel monochrome sensor, along with a 32-megapixel selfie camera. Image quality is good all around — photos from the main camera lean into a slightly saturated, punchy look, but nothing distracting. Low-light photos aren’t up there with the Pixel’s, but they work in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;It’s a shame that US customers can’t pick up the Nord 2 (technically you can import it, but it won’t work properly on our wireless bands so it’s not recommended), because it’s an ideal midrange device in a lot of ways. Our loss is the rest of the world’s gain. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;If you want an inexpensive 5G phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zVN77Q"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is also well worth considering in this price bracket for two very good reasons: it’s a bit less expensive and will be supported with security updates for the next four years. However, it lacks some of the N10’s nice features like a faster refresh rate screen, the camera isn’t as good, and its software feels more cluttered and bloated. The A32 5G is a better pick if you want to hang on to your phone for as many years as possible, but the N10 is a more likable device overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5Ppnc"&gt;If budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The budget phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;If top-notch battery performance is an extremely important feature in your smartphone, then the Moto G Power should be on your shortlist. It’s capable, and you really will get multiple days of battery life on a charge. But if you’re fine getting by on a battery that’s just average, then we think you’ll be happier with a more well-rounded device.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sS7FviYLlQP2Kvj24XJklLhXhOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446425/ajohnson_20210412_4525_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Play covers all of the basics for well under $200.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zLkqZB"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Motorola Moto G Play (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0rkwQp"&gt;The best phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8w9H"&gt;There are plenty of options for those shopping on a tighter budget, but the Motorola Moto G Play is the one that stands out to us. It covers the basics well with a big 5,000mAh battery and a Snapdragon 460 processor that does a good enough job handling daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHIya"&gt;The G Play has a generously sized 6.5-inch screen. It’s a lower-resolution panel at 720p and is difficult to see outside in direct light, but it’s more or less just fine. Camera specs are likewise basic: there’s just one rear-facing 13-megapixel camera that performs well in bright light but isn’t well suited for low-light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTXRvU"&gt;You’ll also want to strongly consider a microSD card purchase with this phone. It only includes 32GB of built-in storage, a lot of which is already occupied by system files. Motorola has only promised security updates for two years, but realistically, the G Play isn’t built to last much longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhtEOa"&gt;It has its shortcomings — the G Play’s performance doesn’t keep up with many phones that are just $50-100 more expensive, for example — but it’s hard to argue with what it does offer for its price: good, basic performance without any major flaws. If there’s flexibility in your budget to spend a little more, you’ll get some meaningful upgrades, like a better camera or a longer-lasting device. But for its price, the G Play does just what it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A four-pack of Tile Bluetooth trackers is $55 today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZplfkM7ZeVVdN1tTD69Oh-_Q5VM=/0x231:1500x1231/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69752573/Tile_Mate_on_an_Umbrella.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tile Mate trackers feature replaceable batteries | Image: Tile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qoM4PT"&gt;Whether you use iOS or Android, the Tile Mate (2020) is a great Bluetooth tracker that’s designed to help you keep watch over your personal stuff. This $15 discount on a four-pack from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tile-RE-19004-Mate-4-Pack/dp/B07W73PTJB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749570688602172611#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is a great value for people getting started with Bluetooth trackers or someone building an arsenal of them. Unlike Apple AirTags, they can remotely ping your phone and also have an innovative design, known as a hole, for easily attaching to things without additional accessories. Similar to AirTags, and to the benefit of humankind, they have user-replaceable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WCnU6G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The search is over: smart trackers from Apple, Samsung, and Tile compared","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22570161/apple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="pAuWYX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10710059"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPeJ79"&gt;The Roku Streambar is an all-in-one solution for your TV’s streaming and audio needs, and is currently $30 off from several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streambar-Streaming-Premium-Released/dp/B08G8JH836?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749571467545583546#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595571-REG%2Froku_9102r_streambar_stereo_soundbar.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1129183/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streambar---hd-4k-hdr-streaming-media-player---38--premium-audio--all-in-one--and-voice-remote-with-tv-controls--2020-%2F-%2FA-79829328" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. The compact, wall-mountable soundbar doubles as a 4K HDR streaming device complete with HDMI, USB, and optical audio ports. It’s perfect for small rooms where space is at a premium, and it will sound better than the tinny speakers found on even some larger, high-end TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QBXmvz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10488551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rwEMMT"&gt;Amazon’s Fire Sticks have become table stakes in the streaming device landscape, though, at this point you probably don’t want anything still topping out at 1080p in the year 2021. This deal for $12 off the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt; brings the price of the 4K streaming stick down to a level we haven’t seen since Amazon Prime Day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yd76MS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10710076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MneVE7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1129183/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-aluminum%2F-%2FA-81498739" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; are currently selling the Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS) for $249, a price that has only been beaten during Black Friday. You can pick from either the silver or space gray configuration on Amazon, and Target also offers the gold colorway. This is the Apple Watch to get if you’re shopping on a budget... assuming you don’t want to deal with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;firmware nightmares&lt;/a&gt; that accompany the Apple Watch Series 3. The SE offers the fast performance and battery life from 2019’s flagship Series 5 watches, but for much less. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iA580U"&gt;If you missed the chance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/8/19/22630760/apple-ipad-airpods-imac-m1-tetris-effect-netgear-wifi-6-router-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, the AirPods Pro are still $70 off at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1133983/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=6890999&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A6890999&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. You don’t get a better deal than this outside of Black Friday times, and you don’t get a better overall experience with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;noise-canceling wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; on iOS or macOS than the AirPods Pro. They come with small, medium, and large silicone ear tips to ensure a comfy fit that seals out ambient noise, though transparency mode can be turned on to let the outside world back in. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Chaim Gartenberg? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PmOWVxKOjwcsxY8wdm3Fw_FnKQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69752446/cgartenberg_210816_4718_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Setting up a brand-new space&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t05WxD"&gt;If you’re a frequent reader of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, I’m sure the name &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/chaim-gartenberg"&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/a&gt; is known to you. He’s been reporting and commenting here for years on everything from the latest AMD Ryzen processors to the new trailer of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, and has become a familiar sight on videos as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFRKEE"&gt;Chaim recently moved to a new space, which means he got a chance to set up a new space for working at home. We asked him to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKOcNC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at The Verge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km0TiP"&gt;I’ve been at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for just over nine years — I started as an intern in August 2012, and I’ve worked with a lot of pieces of the site over years, including being a reporter, working with our Circuit Breaker gadget blog, and, of course, writing tech news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4phBzV"&gt;Right now, I’m one of our news editors, which means a fair amount of news writing, but I also do a lot of tech reporting, in addition to helping out with our culture and games coverage. Mostly, though, I just like getting to write about the latest tech things and geeking out over obscure specification details (looking at you, incomprehensible USB-C standards!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsPs0h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a bit about your workspace. How did you decide where and how to set it up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V9qIO"&gt;We just moved in the beginning of June, and one of the biggest things on the list for when we were apartment hunting was space so that both my wife and I could have our own offices. Mine is technically also our guest bedroom — we have plans to put in a trundle bed / couch-type thing just behind where I usually sit, but it doubles as a pretty spacious office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTLRYL"&gt;The one downside is that there’s not much natural light; the window just faces an internal wall, so I rely a lot on lamps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="desk and chair" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NRCSkX93awjH_pRHmFvKPuXkhbM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793237/cgartenberg_210817_4718_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A console table and a left-over office chair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hYEZC9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRRfo9"&gt;The desk is actually a console table that my wife and I got for free when someone in her old building was giving it away. We ended up getting a nicer table for our entryway, though, and between the height and the width of the table, I thought it would be a pretty perfect desk for me (given that I couldn’t actually fit my knees under my old desk). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl5aqR"&gt;It’s not the deepest desk, so I do have to think a little bit about what I put on there, but it fits my laptop, a notebook, and a bottle of seltzer or a mug of tea, which is good enough for me. The smaller size also helps keep in check my usual tendency to just let all my clutter run rampant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mklBfo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your chair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJbHzb"&gt;I don’t actually have a lot of information on the desk chair. It was a gift from my wife, who snagged it when her company closed down their office when the pandemic started and let folks take home any furniture they wanted. (The wood and fabric filing cabinet that my printer is mounted on also came from there.) Given that I had been using a metal folding chair until then, it was a nice upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="headphones holder" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sw9GHsaWxt1CZILR2ZvNp-7EUSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793241/cgartenberg_210817_4718_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pair of Sony MDR-7506 wired headphones hang near an M1 MacBook Air.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="maZk30"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, let’s go for the gold: could you tell us about the tech that you’re using there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqQMzX"&gt;Absolutely! The star of the show is my main work laptop: an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; issued me, and hands-down the best laptop I’ve ever used. Mine is a 16GB RAM / 512GB storage model, which I’ve customized with a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; sticker (which also helps avoid confusing it with other laptops). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLAjmZ"&gt;To the left is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Powered-Wireless-Charging-iPhone/dp/B07LDDS5NY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech Powered wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not the newest charger around, and is basically only useful for charging an iPhone (it tops out at 7.5W), but it was cheap (since it’s the older model, it cost around $20) and it keeps my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; perfectly angled to unlock with Face ID so I can check my notifications at my desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xrncy5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10709358"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KG9bBO"&gt;The headphone stand is a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fheadphone-stand&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22628813%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-chaim-gartenberg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fancy aluminum model from Master &amp;amp; Dynamic&lt;/a&gt; that just plain looks nice. Hanging on it is a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony MDR-7506&lt;/a&gt; wired headphones, which I keep around for podcasting and any important video calls where I don’t want to risk using a pair of wireless headphones. I keep a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones on top of the metal cabinet to the left of my desk, too, since I live in NYC and, well, the city gets pretty loud sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xwLbI3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10709304"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7CJcW8"&gt;While I work almost exclusively off my laptop, I do keep a fancy camera setup for times that I need to look more professional on a Zoom call. The camera seen here on that tripod is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Premium-Compact-Multi-Interface-DSCRX100M2/dp/B00DM8R866?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony RX 100 II&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s actually not the one I use for calls. That is my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digitial-3-0-Inch-16-50mm/dp/B00I8BICB2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony a6000&lt;/a&gt;, but I needed it to actually shoot the pictures for this article. Similarly, I keep a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rode Podcaster microphone&lt;/a&gt; around for the occasional podcast appearance or when I’m interviewing people for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTX9QA"&gt;The speakers are a pair of since-discontinued Nocs NS2 Air Monitors from 2013 that I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/15/17234280/nocs-ns2-air-monitors-airplay-speakers-bluetooth-obsolete-problem"&gt;bought in college&lt;/a&gt; when they were extra cheap (the company had just released a newer model with Bluetooth). They still sound great, but they’ve never been updated to AirPlay 2, so using them as wireless speakers is a little flaky. Usually I just plug them into my laptop instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zfJJLT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10709338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWP5CH"&gt;To the left of the speakers is a stack of smart home gadgets: a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749563079979439697" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Mini&lt;/a&gt; (for controlling the lights and air conditioning in the office), a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749563126328264024" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Wifi puck&lt;/a&gt; (one of three scattered around the apartment), an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-Control-Automation-Supports-Assistant/dp/B08Y1PJZZH/ref=sr_1_5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aqara hub&lt;/a&gt; for our light switches, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Stand-Alone-Bridge/dp/B016H0QZ7I?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue hub&lt;/a&gt; for our smart bulbs. Please ignore the rat’s nest of cables peeking out behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntW15F"&gt;On top of the metal filing cabinet is what I like to think of as my charging station: it’s where I keep any gadgets or gizmos that need occasional charging, like my custom-hacked iPod (which has 256GB of internal storage and a quadruple-sized battery), my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Oasis-now-with-adjustable-warm-light/dp/B07F7TLZF4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, and my Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones (when they need a top up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYSNXS"&gt;And then on the right of my desk is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL-L2360DW-Wireless-Networking-Replenishment/dp/B00LEA5EJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brother HL-L2360DW&lt;/a&gt; laser printer that I bought in 2017. It’s a very basic printer: it only prints in black and white and doesn’t feature much in the way of bells or whistles. It is wireless, though, and does support duplex printing, both of which are more useful to me than color photos. I don’t actually have to print out that many things these days, but it’s extremely helpful for the occasional concert tickets, shipping labels, and other assorted random documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSVmIy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything special about the baseball?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1WGYZ"&gt;I got the baseball from a Yankees game years ago that my dad took me and my brothers to, and it sits on top of a 3D-printed gear that one of my college friends made for me. Mostly, though, it’s just another thing to occasionally fidget around with during the day, &lt;a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Baseball_(object)" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Captain Sisko-style&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWbq3G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I envy you your Baby Yoda. (Although I have a Jawa that’s nearly as cute.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6qOCt"&gt;Thank you! I got it &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeWOYDChaim081921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F750337366%2Fthe-original-baby-child-the-baby-child" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from an Etsy seller&lt;/a&gt; when the Mandalorian had first kicked off Baby Yoda fever across the internet — something that actually turned into an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21069124/baby-yoda-dolls-etsy-disney-mandalorian-copyright-takedown-enforcement" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;interesting story for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how Disney was issuing take-down notices for the most popular unlicensed toys featuring the character. He used to live on my desk at the office, but I rescued him from the empty office when I started working more remote last year. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xE0W6g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I also like your bulletin board setup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V7Vla"&gt;It’s very much a work in progress, but I had accumulated a lot of random bits of art, stickers, and patches over the year that were living in a drawer. I’m still planning to add a lot of stuff to that setup — especially some pictures — but it’s a big step up from the blank slate of wall that used to be there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxO2UW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And there are a few old-fashioned touches: the dictionary, for example, and the Sega Genesis cartridge. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HanHIR"&gt;The Genesis cartridge has lived on various desks of mine since high school; Sonic is one of the first games I can ever remember playing, and while I don’t actually have a Sega Genesis anymore, it’s a nice reminder to have. The dictionary is more aspirational: I like the idea of thumbing through an actual paper book to look up things while I’m writing, although I usually tend to just use my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXm1Qf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is obviously a work in progress. Do you have any other plans to add decorations, furniture, or other stuff to the space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGHzHy"&gt;Absolutely. I’m currently looking into replacing the desk with a larger and adjustable standing desk, and potentially getting a monitor / keyboard / mouse setup so I can dock my laptop and use a more traditional desktop setup with a bigger screen (that’s probably also better for my posture). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGwPuV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays mandatory return to office until January 2022, citing COVID-19 surge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9SnhLWY1-n2OuGl3h_ZHVZNVISk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751419/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fQ5JS0"&gt;Apple is delaying its mandatory return to offices until at least January 2022, citing a surge in COVID-19 cases. The company will give employees a month’s notice before they have to return to in-person work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhOMfs"&gt;In an internal email sent this evening, Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of people and retail, encouraged employees to get vaccinated and noted that Apple retail stores remain open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNPfap"&gt;“I know there are feeling of frustration that the pandemic is not yet behind us,” she wrote. “For many colleagues around the world, this period has been a time of great tragedy, suffering, and heartbreak. Please know that we are all here to support one another and stand with one another during such challenging times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9ysli"&gt;The company, which previously discouraged working from home for most employees, changed its stance in June when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Tim Cook said he would test a hybrid work model&lt;/a&gt; that would require employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. That date was then moved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584761/apple-return-to-office-delayed-covid-delta-variant"&gt;to at least October&lt;/a&gt; — and now the New Year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKC6Xf"&gt;Some employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;pushed back strongly against this model&lt;/a&gt;, saying they want a more flexible policy where anyone who wants to work from home can. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Policy groups request Apple abandon plans to scan devices for child abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSXBPBTPSMgp9m4g8l2fX1ML5tw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749739/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Policy groups have asked Apple to abandon plans to scan iPhones for images of abuse | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwiiC4"&gt;An international coalition of policy and civil rights groups published an open letter Thursday asking Apple to “abandon its recently announced plans to build surveillance capabilities into iPhones, iPads and other Apple products.” The groups include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Access Now, Privacy International, and the Tor Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UopXV"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;Apple announced its plans &lt;/a&gt;to use new tech within iOS to detect potential child abuse imagery with the goal of limiting the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. Apple also announced a new “communication safety” feature, which will use on-device machine learning to identify and blur sexually explicit images received by children in its Messages app. Parents of children age 12 and younger can be notified if the child views or sends such an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Vimb"&gt;“Though these capabilities are intended to protect children and to reduce the spread of child sexual abuse material, we are concerned that they will be used to censor protected speech, threaten the privacy and security of people around the world, and have disastrous consequences for many children,” the groups wrote in &lt;a href="https://cdt.org/insights/international-coalition-calls-on-apple-to-abandon-plan-to-build-surveillance-capabilities-into-iphones-ipads-and-other-products"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYhVGE"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F19%2F22632722%2Fapple-child-abuse-scan-ios-abandon-request-privacy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new “Child Safety” page&lt;/a&gt; details the plans, which call for on-device scanning before an image is backed up in iCloud. The scanning does not occur until a file is being backed up to iCloud, and Apple says it only receives data about a match if the cryptographic vouchers (uploaded to iCloud along with the image) for an account meet a threshold of matching known CSAM. Apple and other cloud email providers have used hash systems to scan for CSAM sent via email, but the new program would apply the same scans to images stored in iCloud, even if the user never shares or sends them to anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="g4EOs7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RJIEhX"&gt;In response to concerns about how the technology might be misused, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;Apple followed up by saying&lt;/a&gt; it would limit its use to detecting CSAM “and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBqYM0"&gt;Much of the pushback against the new measures has been focused on the device-scanning feature, but the civil rights and privacy groups said the plan to blur nudity in children’s iMessages could potentially put children in danger and will break iMessage’s end-to-end encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKP6zM"&gt;“Once this backdoor feature is built in, governments could compel Apple to extend notification to other accounts, and to detect images that are objectionable for reasons other than being sexually explicit,” the letter states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvN7IH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story of a leaker who ‘worked’ as a double agent for Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jRNdlGG8dCkzuHbyA_Fs4juZ4K4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749434/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SuXhhK"&gt;Apple products are often leaked because they’re immensely popular, the company is protective of its plans, and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7en78/9to5mac-writer-paid-source-dollar500-in-bitcoin-for-stolen-apple-data"&gt;people are willing to pay&lt;/a&gt; for just about any information on a new product. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqyz8/apples-double-agent"&gt;A new must-read report from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that not everyone selling Apple leaks is on the up-and-up, and not because of the information they’re peddling. Some leakers are working for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrmrp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai spoke to a double agent named Andrey Shumeyko, an Apple leaker who began offering information to the company in 2017. By the time 2020 rolled around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267590/ios-14-leaked-early-version-internet-months-vice"&gt;and iOS 14 leaked&lt;/a&gt;, Shumeyko was actively trying to become Apple’s mole, tracking leaked hardware and software and sharing it with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15837522/apple-internal-presentation-leaks"&gt;Apple’s Global Security team&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of getting paid, and to “redeem himself for being part of that community.” There’s a reason why he spoke to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;in the first place, though. Apple never paid and “never took into consideration my side and me as a person,” Shumeyko tells &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uhar0H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The mole got played&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1aYKxL"&gt;What’s interesting about Shumeyko’s story isn’t the fact that there are moles working within the communities selling Apple’s biggest secrets, it’s that Apple managed to keep Shumeyko  sharing information for almost a year. Hacking and ferreting out leaks can sometimes involve social engineering, manipulating people rather than the technical tools they use. It’s just unusual to see such a clear version of it working the other way, and not with a ton of complexity. In private messages, Apple appealed to Shumeyko’s interest in the company and his sense of guilt — and it worked, until it didn’t. Here’s what he says one Apple employee told him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QFk9b7"&gt;Please understand that our goal is to protect Apple. All our actions are guided by the premise of what is best for the company, our employees, and our customers (of which you are one). Therefore your help—and insights—in understanding possible threats to us are very important...Do the right things to protect Apple. Keep it that way, you will be proud of yourself, so will we.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lZSPUx"&gt;You should read &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqyz8/apples-double-agent"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s full piece&lt;/a&gt; to learn about all the leaks Shumeyko was involved in, and the not-so-subtle ways Apple tried to manipulate him. For all the information that still made it out, Apple remains an intimidating company to mess with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Foundation trailer has some serious ‘Game of Thrones but in space’ energy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htOt2NDjRXJQdtwzpsiCqOGmHiw=/0x32:1828x1251/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748186/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.52.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="miQG7D"&gt;Apple has released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4QYV5GTz7c"&gt;a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its upcoming epic sci-fi show for Apple TV Plus based on Isaac Asimov’s series of novels, and I’m getting some serious “&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;but in space”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;energy from it. There are vast (space) vistas, a sweeping soundtrack, numerous shots of people making very serious faces, and dramatic proclamations that wouldn’t be out of place in an early episode of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B82vBj"&gt;“Wars will be endless.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OZiHUh"&gt;“Martyrs tend to have a long half-life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DRso2D"&gt;“Change is frightening. Especially to those in power.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DDrqms"&gt;And you know what? That’s fine with me. For me, nothing has replicated the excellence of the first few seasons of &lt;em&gt;Game of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Thrones. &lt;/em&gt;Their gripping action, shocking twists, and captivating power struggles made every episode feel important, and I eagerly anticipated each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RovptT"&gt;Based on this trailer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553852/foundation-trailer-apple-tv-plus-premier-date"&gt;and the last one&lt;/a&gt;, Apple seems to be going for a similar vibe with &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m looking forward to watching the show for myself to see if it recaptures that &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; magic. (If you’re looking for a short explainer about the &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; novels, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223728/apple-foundation-trilogy-isaac-asimov-tv-show-david-goyer-josh-friedman"&gt;we’ve got one in this article&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="918P0x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; premieres on Apple TV Plus on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
