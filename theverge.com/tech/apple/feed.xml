    <title>US Apple Maps users are getting the ability to rate places and add their own photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67lhjtovfqRPKE0O5WbrOpYqTx0=/0x138:1125x888/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769463/Image_from_iOS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BV4ZwY"&gt;Apple Maps’ built-in ratings and photos system is rolling out to the US and Canada, letting users add their own information to points of interest on the map (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/23/apple-maps-native-review-feature-us-users/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The system uses a thumbs up / thumbs down rating, and currently exists alongside Apple Maps’ existing integrations like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="40viqo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10715914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ltg8GS"&gt;According to Apple, the feature started rolling out in the US and Canada on Monday, so there aren’t many places that have ratings yet. However, an Apple spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature launched with iOS 14 and has been available in other countries like Japan or Australia for some time. That makes it possible to see how they show up by looking at point of interest cards abroad, where we can see the number of ratings and what percentage of them are positive for the location overall, as well as for any specific amenities that users rated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image showing the product card for Apple’s Ginza store. Included is a label saying 21 ratings, with a thumbs up icon and a label that reads 95 percent. There’s also thumbs up / thumbs down buttons, and breakdowns for customer service and products ratings, both with a thumbs up icon and percentage label." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2ZVmZkfsn0sFGYeaem16dFlzcI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801638/IMG_2305.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Ginza store in Tokyo has solid ratings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9jN6Py"&gt;According to Apple’s introduction screen for the feature, Maps will suggest contributions for you based on your device’s location history, as well as photos in your photos library (the analysis for which Apple says happens on-device). Your name also &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/08/23/apple-maps-ratings-and-photos-feature-debuts-in-us"&gt;doesn't appear to be publicly linked&lt;/a&gt; to the ratings you provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Odr7"&gt;So far, the ratings and photos system is rudimentary — you’re not able to leave any written feedback, and the app is still pulling photos, reviews, and ratings from other sources like Yelp or Tripadvisor. However, it does seem like Apple could be laying the groundwork here for a Google Maps-like system with data provided by Apple Maps users instead of being pulled in from other sources. If Apple does go that route, it could be bad news for Yelp, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/26/21401031/yelp-competition-google-stoppelman-interview-basecamp-epic-apple"&gt;already competing with Google’s user reviews and photos in search results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrPBvL"&gt;Ratings aren’t the only user-generated information Apple’s added to maps — it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275558/apple-maps-beta-accident-speed-trap-reporting"&gt;added the ability to report accidents, hazards, and speed checks&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fios-14-5-offers-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch-diverse-siri-voices-and-more%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22638723%2Fapple-maps-ratings-photos-us-rollout-ios-yelp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s art-inspired Frame 4K TV is $200 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Frame TV 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpVgcsh0R4DUKmVc_yF-9anmN-8=/0x1005:4194x3801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768188/2018_2_The_Frame_Lifestyle_Image_Assets_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Frame camouflages itself as wall art when you’re not using it as a TV. | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aofzh8"&gt;The Frame, Samsung’s HDR-compatible QLED that pulls double duty as wall art, is one of the more unique TV designs that didn’t die in the concept phase or on the showroom floor of CES. Designed to look like a framed and matted photograph, the 120Hz screen hides in plain sight when switched to an Art Mode that displays still imagery instead of a black void when turned off. It’s a stunner of a TV in many ways and, for a limited time, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927639433300823#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are offering the 55-inch model for $200 off, the second-lowest price we’ve seen this year on the high-tech piece of home decor. It’s the perfect way to convince your friends you’re a person of culture and refinement while still being a techie nerd who loves large screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="StEUzN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZNP6n"&gt;If you use the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro and want a more laptop-like experience, there are deals for both the previous-gen and newly revised Apple Magic Keyboards. Functionally the same, both Magic Keyboards augment the work and play capabilities of the iPad Pro with a quality trackpad and tactile keyboard that folds up to protect the screen. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927298996490402#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; currently has the older model for $199 (a discount of $150) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-iPad-Pro-12-9-inch/dp/B09327XWMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has the newer one for $324 (a discount of $25). The main difference between the two? The updated Magic Keyboard more adequately accommodates the slightly thicker dimensions of this year’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BtRsMX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says old Magic Keyboard is ‘functionally compatible’ with new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but warns of imperfect fit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410350/apple-ipad-pro-mini-led-magic-keyboard-case-2020-model-fit-accessory-screen-protector"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="Cmzl61"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="4tTXe9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10715671"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sLzcDa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22609444/google-nest-cam-indoor-floodlight-doorbell-price-specs-news" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google recently released&lt;/a&gt; a new version of its Nest Doorbell (formerly the Nest Hello) that lets you choose between battery or wired for power, and now the previous-gen wired model has received a sizable discount. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927503440938157#dotnotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hdr-video-doorbell-wired%2F-%2FA-52629447%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_doorbell_wired?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are all currently offering $50 off the wired configuration, matching the price of the newer model at $180. The newer model might be more convenient and include a few additional enhancements, but with the previous model you’ll get slightly higher resolution capture and 24/7 recording without ever having to worry about charging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUqG0V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10715814"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tulrmO"&gt;Aside from its drones, DJI is most known for its expertise with gyros and stabilizers in the world of gimbals. The DJI OM 4 is its latest-gen mobile gimbal, and it allows for rock-solid stability when shooting videos with a smartphone. The OM4 normally sells for $149, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-OM-Handheld-Smartphone-Stabilizer/dp/B08CMVGVQY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1582634-REG%2Fdji_cp_os_00000108_01_osmo_mobile_4_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22637841%2Fsamsung-frame-tv-apple-ipad-keyboard-nest-doorbell-dji-om4-gimbal-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; both have it for $20 off. Pairing this three-axis stabilizer and mini tripod with an iPhone or Android device that captures 4K video can enhance any vlogging or amateur YouTube setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WJ9EGH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10715843"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Gpta1P"&gt;More great deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DyMCjz"&gt;

&lt;li id="2P5Url"&gt;While the Sony A7III camera with kit lens saw a discount last week, you can now save on just the body. Both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1394217-REG%2Fsony_ilce_7m3_alpha_a7_iii_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22637841%2Fsamsung-frame-tv-apple-ipad-keyboard-nest-doorbell-dji-om4-gimbal-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa7m3.html&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; are offering the A7III for $300 off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FCeewS"&gt;The Razer Nari Essential is a great wireless gaming headset that gets the key basics down, while offering up added features like 7.1 surround and spatial audio. Normally $100, &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836602-13527013?sid=vergedeals082421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Frazer-nari-essential-gaming-headset-21" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt; currently has it for $55, its lowest price to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Y2GtQ"&gt;Anker’s myriad power accessories take many shapes. The PowerPort Cube is a compact extension cord and strip powering three USB ports and three power plugs that can be brought on the go or utilized at home. The five-foot, white model is currently $3 off if you clip the coupon on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerPort-Overload-Protection-Ultra-Compact/dp/B07D25RSWX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for 15 percent off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KgW13M"&gt;SSDs reign supreme with speed, but sometimes you just need a ton of storage. If you don’t mind opting for slower speeds, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Expansion-Desktop-External-STEB6000403/dp/B07CX8QBG4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has Seagate’s 6TB external hard drive for $100 (a discount of $60). &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>A guide to platform fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XyTj24P6kioSYNC-lI2mpiPCQGI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67438682/VRG_ILLO_4687_A_guide_to_platform_fees.7.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The hidden costs behind your favorite apps, games, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iNHwd8"&gt;Online marketplaces like Etsy and Apple’s App Store allow businesses to flourish by connecting them to huge, global audiences. But these marketplaces are big businesses themselves, and in order to earn a profit, they take a cut of revenue from many of the other companies that use their space. It leads to a constant tension: apps like Tinder and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t be nearly the phenomena they are today without the App Store, but they have to constantly pay Apple for that privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOSXIP"&gt;Apps are just one example of how online platforms for small businesses and independent creators have shifted the world we live and work in. Membership platforms, like Patreon, allow creatives to charge monthly payments in exchange for new videos, comics, and essays. Video services like Twitch and YouTube allow creators to monetize their time through advertising revenue. And marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon allow people to sell an assortment of products directly to customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5flZWs"&gt;The cut each platform takes varies significantly: Apple notoriously takes 30 percent of many digital in-app purchases; Twitch takes a 50 percent cut of subscription fees and a cut of advertising; eBay asks people to buy space and then pay a fee.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Knowing just how much each platform takes is crucial to figuring out what’s best for your business, or for understanding how the businesses you’re shopping from make money. Here are the various fees each platform takes, divided into four categories: app stores, creator platforms (including memberships, video services, and more), digital marketplaces, and games marketplaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="da0jpB"&gt;App stores&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="kzShWw"&gt;App stores are where an enormous number of businesses operate. Whether someone is selling a line of jewelry on Etsy or spending oodles of money in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, app stores are the gateway to reaching people who shop on their phones and computers. Approximately 80 percent of Americans shop online, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-shopping-and-e-commerce/"&gt;according to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, and more than half of those shoppers use a mobile device like a phone or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwHDdJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple App Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases of digital goods and services; sales of physical products are exempt. Subscription commission falls to 15 percent after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYKQp1"&gt;Developers that make less than $1 million per year in App Store sales can receive 15 percent commission through &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1628805769807344&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0P0P5jBkjzYy3mt-xf5cP3"&gt;Apple’s App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they qualify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjDxJ4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases of digital goods and services; sales of physical products are exempt. Subscription commission falls to 15 percent after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foAtEv"&gt;Google takes 15 percent in fees on developers’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;first $1 million in Play Store revenue&lt;/a&gt; every year. After the $1 million threshold, the rate goes back up to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXAXaL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission &lt;a href="https://seller.samsungapps.com/help/termsAndConditions.as"&gt;on purchases through the app store&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be negotiated with Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBcY1h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon App Store: &lt;/strong&gt;30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases. Subscription commission is 20 percent on video apps and 30 percent on everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjo4FI"&gt;Developers that make less than $1 million per year in app store revenue can receive a 20 percent commission and 10 percent in “promotional credits” for Amazon Web Services through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537726/amazon-app-store-cut-revenue-1-million-80-20-10"&gt;Amazon’s Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcVW3E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 15 percent commission on apps and 12 percent commission on PC games starting August 1st, 2021. A 30 percent commission on all apps, games, and in-app purchases on Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsmi77"&gt;Non-game sellers can also &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1628805769796035&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2pcTZw9XK5Y0m1YuGgSipt"&gt;use their own payment system&lt;/a&gt; and avoid Microsoft’s commission entirely as of July 28th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="qZw43L"&gt;Creator platforms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="SgT0wL"&gt;While app stores largely fit into the logic of their real-life, physical counterparts, an ever-growing breed of creator platforms allows people to monetize their personality and creativity more directly. Whether glued on to an existing social network like Facebook or reinventing old forms of entertainment like Clubhouse, creator platforms have found familiar ways to earn a buck on the backs of creator popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kw9kde"&gt;Membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pUePjZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patreon:&lt;/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing"&gt;three types of plans&lt;/a&gt; creators can enroll in, and each plan comes with a different cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aKTu7G"&gt;Lite plan: Patreon takes 5 percent &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xdqpTH"&gt;Pro plan: Patreon takes 8 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="27Ahq9"&gt;Premium plan: Patreon takes 12 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4mMLwm"&gt;The tiers are geared toward different types of creators and businesses. The pro tier lets a creator offer tiered memberships to fans, while the premium tier provides a dedicated contact at Patreon who can provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7bsBU"&gt;Then, there are payment processing fees. For creators in the United States, Patreon takes 5 percent plus 10 cents for payments of $3 or less. Payments over $3 result in a 2.9 percent cut plus 30 cents going to Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1g66UD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OnlyFans: &lt;/strong&gt;OnlyFans takes 20 percent of subscription fees and other earnings, like tips. Creators can set their subscription fees between $5 and $50 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxLgHH"&gt;Tips &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/help/2/14/55"&gt;max out at $100&lt;/a&gt; for new users and go up to $200 for users who have had an account for four months or longer. You can tip $500 per day as a new user, with the limit increasing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kl0STG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter: &lt;/strong&gt;Twitter offers an array of ways for creators to make money. Super Follows &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/super-follows-creator#sfstatus"&gt;allows creators to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; of $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month in exchange for perks like exclusive tweets. &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed-faq"&gt;Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt; allow creators to charge for access to live audio events, with ticket prices ranging anywhere from $1 to $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmwxFS"&gt;For both products, Twitter takes a 3 percent commission on payments (after payment processing and in-app purchase fees, such as Apple’s 30 percent cut) until creators earn their first $50,000 on the platform, after which Twitter takes 20 percent. The features are only available to select users for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fREbo7"&gt;Creators can also &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tip-jar"&gt;receive money directly&lt;/a&gt; through Twitter’s Tip Jar feature, which is currently in beta and only available to some users. Twitter doesn’t take a cut, but payments are subject to the processing fees of whatever third-party payment service is linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRIGoN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook: &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/646162679132229?id=558489708108283"&gt;lets creators offer monthly Fan Subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; and receive support directly from their followers. Facebook plans to take up to a 30 percent cut each month, but the company has announced it won’t be taking any fees until 2023. Apple and Google do take their typical cut on mobile, though, reducing creators’ share to 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZpksF"&gt;Facebook also offers &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/903272529876480?id=648321075955172"&gt;a tipping feature for livestreams called Stars&lt;/a&gt; — basically its answer to Twitch’s Bits. Creators get 1 cent per star, but (like Twitch below) viewers buy them for more than a penny each. If a viewer is buying only a few dollars at a time, Facebook might take upward of 18 percent of the money spent on tips. Creators also need to meet &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/understand-monetization-eligibility-status"&gt;Facebook’s eligibility requirements&lt;/a&gt; to enable Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhjJ7q"&gt;Bulletin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555957/facebook-bulletin-newsletter-subscriptions-substack-competitor"&gt;Facebook’s newsletter product&lt;/a&gt;, currently doesn’t take a cut of subscriptions, though Facebook has so far limited the platform to a select group of higher-profile writers and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tAXPLP"&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WwLzwg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube: &lt;/strong&gt;Creators primarily make money on YouTube through ad revenue. YouTube takes 45 percent of revenue from ads and gives creators 55 percent, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/youtube-standardizes-ad-revenue-split-for-all-partners-but-offers-upside-potential-1200786223/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuzLo7"&gt;YouTube also has a number of ways for creators to get paid directly by viewers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9MnA3"&gt;The platform lets channels offer memberships, which are &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9355861?p=cm_internationalpricing&amp;amp;visit_id=637360435699211837-3596854631&amp;amp;rd=1"&gt;monthly subscriptions that run between $1 and $100&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePlvW1"&gt;Similar to several Twitch features, YouTube’s Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Super Thanks features give fans the ability to tip creators in exchange for perks like better comment placement in a livestream chat, custom stickers, and animations. Prices range from $1 to $500 for pinned Super Chat comments, $1 to $50 for Super Stickers, and $2 to $50 for Super Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEWAAi"&gt;YouTube takes 30 percent of the revenue earned on memberships and Super features once taxes and applicable app store fees are deducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtIxX"&gt;Creators can also sell merchandise from select retailers directly to subscribers via the merch shelf underneath videos. YouTube doesn’t take a cut of merch sales, but creators may be subject to different fees depending on which of the 31 different supported retailers they partner with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3CbSp"&gt;YouTube also shares revenue from YouTube Premium subscriptions based on the amount subscribers watch a creator’s videos. The company has not disclosed how that money is divided, but YouTube tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; most of the revenue from Premium goes to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cvnha"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitch: &lt;/strong&gt;A creator can start making money from ads, subscriptions, and donations once they become a Twitch affiliate, which takes a certain amount of streaming and followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOlblB"&gt;Twitch typically takes 50 percent of subscription fees. Subscription pricing varies by country to reflect the local cost of living. As an example, a base subscription is $4.99 per month in the US but around $1.20 per month in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUmXvX"&gt;Twitch also offers streamers a way to be paid via donations using a virtual currency called bits. Twitch pays creators 1 cent per bit, so after receiving 100 bits, a streamer gets $1. The catch is, viewers pay extra up front to buy those bits: 100 bits costs $1.40 to buy on the web, or around $2 to buy on mobile to account for app store fees. That means anywhere from 29 percent to 50 percent of money spent toward tipping is being lost to fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZwiB0"&gt;Streamers frequently accept donations through third-party payment platforms, too. Twitch doesn’t take a cut of these, but the platforms themselves may come with their own &lt;a href="https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/twitch-donate-button-online-donations/"&gt;deductions for payment processing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX1J8T"&gt;On top of subscriber fees, streamers also earn ad revenue — usually around $3.50 for every 1,000 views of an ad on their channel. For both subscriptions and advertising, bigger streamers may get better deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BAgG9v"&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rnekUT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse: &lt;/strong&gt; Live social audio app Clubhouse allows listeners &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/introducing-payments"&gt;to pay creators directly&lt;/a&gt; via a “Send Money” button. Clubhouse doesn’t take a cut of the payments, and the person leaving the tip is asked to cover the payment processing fee from Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Z3Y4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify: &lt;/strong&gt;Through its subsidiary Anchor, Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/"&gt;allows podcasters to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify won’t take a cut until 2023, after which the company will charge a 5 percent commission. Creators have to cover payment processing fees out of their share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEvz7v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price"&gt;Subscriptions in Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are subject to the same rules as other subscriptions on Apple platforms: there’s a 30 percent commission to start, but if subscribers stick around for a year, the commission drops to 15 percent. Creators also have to pay $19.99 per year to offer subscriptions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNFQOj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discord: &lt;/strong&gt;Through its live audio feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22431438/discord-stage-channel-discovery-social-audio-threads-logo-clyde"&gt;Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;, Discord offers creators the ability to sell tickets to their audio events. The feature is currently in a limited beta, and Discord hasn’t announced if it will keep a portion of ticket sales or when the feature will be available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l1Hn6e"&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rsWmOU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumblr: &lt;/strong&gt;A subscription feature, called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586765/tumblr-subscription-blogs-post-plus"&gt;Post Plus&lt;/a&gt;, lets creators offer subscriber-only posts for $3.99, $5.99, or $9.99 per month. Tumblr takes a 5 percent commission on subscription fees, and for subscriptions made through iOS or Android, creators will lose an additional 30 percent to the respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L56CvI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack: &lt;/strong&gt;The newsletter platform takes &lt;a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037607131-How-much-does-Substack-cost-"&gt;10 percent of subscription fees&lt;/a&gt;. Substack lets writers choose how much they want to charge newsletter subscribers per month or year. (There’s also a free tier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHh9N7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wattpad: &lt;/strong&gt;Fiction publishing platform Wattpad offers a limited form of monetization for certain creators. &lt;a href="https://support.wattpad.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022692911-Paid-Stories-Program"&gt;Invite-only Paid Stories&lt;/a&gt; allows fans to purchase coins to unlock entries in an ongoing story or novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ARgg"&gt;Currently, Wattpad sells coins in several different packages (you can get nine coins for 99 cents, for example) and chapters are usually priced at three coins each (though some go for more). Wattpad says writers receive the “majority of the revenue from the program,” but it has not publicly disclosed the exact split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tas7Ql"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Vella: &lt;/strong&gt;Amazon has its own take on Wattpad’s Paid Stories, &lt;a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G5TFR9WSHB46ZKFN"&gt;called Kindle Vella&lt;/a&gt;. Writers who publish with Vella receive royalties based on the number of tokens spent on an “episode” in their story, with token cost determined by the episode’s length (one token per 100 words). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RFCNQ"&gt;Writers get to keep half of whatever a reader spent on the tokens they used to unlock their story, minus taxes and fees. The complicating factor is that Amazon offers tokens at different price points — you can buy 200 tokens for $1.99 or 1,100 tokens for $9.99 — so payouts can vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq6k84"&gt;At those price points, for example, a writer who receives 100 tokens would either get $1 or 90 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Dvhlsk"&gt;Digital marketplaces&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="aekChA"&gt;Digital marketplaces for physical goods are at the core of online shopping. Many of us use Amazon on a daily or weekly basis, or peruse eBay at work to keep an eye on the latest auctions. But while large businesses can be built on these platforms, their terms can be complicated to navigate and tend to ensure the platforms make a cut on just about every sale that goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ca9l9t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook and Instagram:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook collects either 5 percent per shipment of products sold (one order can include multiple shipments if items are mailed separately), or a flat fee of 40 cents for shipments of $8 or less. This covers taxes, payment processing fees, and applies to all checkout transactions on both Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYoJCi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/223030991929920?id=533228987210412"&gt;Facebook is waiving the selling fee&lt;/a&gt; for all orders shipping through June 30th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWvS6P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon is a complicated one. First, &lt;a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html?ref_=sdus_soa_wic_n#selling-plans"&gt;businesses can choose&lt;/a&gt; between using a professional selling plan, which costs $39.99 a month, or an individual seller’s plan, which has no monthly fee. Those on the professional tier do not have to pay a sales fee on items sold, while those on an individual seller’s plan pay $1 per sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Jqm4G"&gt;Amazon then takes a commission on each sale, including shipping fees. This fee depends on what the item is, typically ranging from 8 to 20 percent. There’s also a $1.80 closing fee for products listed under media categories, including books, DVDs, music, game consoles, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGMlxp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Etsy:&lt;/strong&gt; Etsy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsell%3Fref%3Dftr&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21445923%2Fplatform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;charges a 20-cent fee&lt;/a&gt; for people to list each item for sale. Then, for every product sold, Etsy takes a 5 percent transaction fee, and a payment processing fee of 3 percent plus 25 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FDHHi"&gt;The company also runs an advertising program that’s somewhat controversial with sellers. Etsy pays to advertise their products on sites like Google, and then takes up to a 15 percent fee (but no more than $100) if they lead to a sale. Small sellers can opt out, but larger sellers have to participate; for them, Etsy only takes a 12 percent referral fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDJv8F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally speaking, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Ffees-and-features.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21445923%2Fplatform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay sellers might pay a small fee&lt;/a&gt; to list a product and a 12.5 percent commission on the sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kIY9Z"&gt;Fees can vary significantly depending on product category and listing type, though. eBay also offers paid premium store features that can reduce fees. It’s a fairly complicated series of options — you can get a sense of some possibilities for paying stores from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/run-your-store/subscriptions-and-fees.html#m22_tb_a2__2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_21209964__t_w__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="8EauQs"&gt;Games marketplaces&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="im3fHn"&gt;From a single developer to a huge studio, being on Steam or in the PlayStation store is a big deal for distribution. These giant marketplaces are also key businesses for the companies that run them, often meaning steep fees on sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjp36I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam:&lt;/strong&gt; Steam takes &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/1697191267930157838?content_only=true"&gt;30 percent of all sales&lt;/a&gt; made until the first $10 million. That cut becomes 25 percent when a developer sells between $10 million and $50 million. For every sale after the first $50 million, Steam only takes a 20 percent cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="No2ULR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic:&lt;/strong&gt; Epic takes 12 percent of the revenue from all games sold, giving developers 88 percent. Epic CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1120441795010338816?s=20"&gt;Tim Sweeney tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that of the 12 percent Epic collects, the company nets about 5 percent as profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtIZnS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PlayStation:&lt;/strong&gt; Sony is reported to take a 30 percent cut from games sold in the PlayStation Store, though the split isn’t publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNvkLf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xbox:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft &lt;a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4OG2b"&gt;takes a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; from all games and in-game purchases sold through the console’s store under its standard developer agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMZpzT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itch.io&lt;/strong&gt;: Itch.io takes &lt;a href="https://itch.io/updates/introducing-open-revenue-sharing"&gt;a radical approach&lt;/a&gt; to how it handles its revenue share with its independent creators. By default, the platform takes 10 percent of each transaction before payment providers take their cut. But if creators choose, as part of Itch’s open revenue sharing, they can lower that cut to zero or raise it to as high as 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nofJy8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 24th, 2021, 9AM ET:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published in September 2020; it has been updated and expanded for 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPIkG5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden reportedly hosting cybersecurity meeting with Tim Cook, Satya Nadella, and Andy Jassy attending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At 2019 Dreamforce Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_ns6qHpSM2ZQEkHxNJqcg898cE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69766544/1183490754.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p03RW0"&gt;President Joe Biden plans to host a meeting on Wednesday to discuss how companies are improving cybersecurity after the waves of recent security breaches and ransomware attacks, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy will be attending, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/apple-s-cook-microsoft-s-nadella-plan-to-visit-white-house?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Google, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, and the energy firm Southern Company have also been invited, and Southern Company CEO Tom Fanning is also set to attend, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYxElX"&gt;While it’s not clear exactly what the president and any attendees plan to discuss, there will surely be a lot to talk about given incidents like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;massive Solarwinds hack&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22564054/ransomware-revil-kaseya-coop"&gt;Kaseya ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;the Colonial Pipeline shutdown&lt;/a&gt; resulting from a cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isr1jL"&gt;Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, IBM, JPMorgan, and Southern Company all declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg,&lt;/em&gt; and a Southern Company spokesperson declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The other companies and the White House have not replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees are organizing, now under the banner #AppleToo </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/soaXPKqSo6ORL2cvv7Cki-DsE_g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765010/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OZ6WX6"&gt;Apple employee organizing took another step this morning with the launch of a website called &lt;a href="https://appletoo.us/"&gt;AppleToo&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to collect stories from workers at all levels of the organization who’ve experienced harassment or discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8X1gj"&gt;“For too long, Apple has evaded public scrutiny,” the website reads. “The truth is that for many Apple workers ... the culture of secrecy creates an opaque, intimidating fortress. When we press for accountability and redress to the persistent injustices we witness or experience in our workplace, we are faced with a pattern of isolation, degradation, and gaslighting. No more. We’ve exhausted all internal avenues. We’ve talked with our leadership. We’ve gone to the People team. We’ve escalated through Business Conduct. Nothing has changed. It’s time to Think Different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qy4bHp"&gt;Only about 15 current and former Apple employees were directly involved in the organizing effort. This morning, the organizers launched the website and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleLaborers"&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; and sent the news out on a 200-person Discord server for Apple employees and contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pOdio"&gt;The effort has already gained support from organizers like Timnit Gebru, who worked at Apple prior to joining Google in 2018. After Gebru was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;abruptly fired from Google in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, she went public about her experiences with racism and discrimination at the company. But she hasn’t spoken quite so publicly about her time at Apple. Now, she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “I experienced so many egregious things when I was at Apple, and always wondered how they manage to get out of the spotlight. I’m happy to see that Apple workers are organizing. It is past time for Apple to be held accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpDXXX"&gt;Cher Scarlett, an Apple engineer and activist who’s involved in the organizing effort, posted the website in two internal Slack channels — #allies4change and #women-in-swe — this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple debuts new trailer for The Morning Show’s second season ahead of September premiere</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ghQgHq"&gt;Apple has shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qZWPTsR-Wc"&gt;a new trailer for the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of its premier series for Apple TV Plus. The new 10-episode season debuts on September 17th, with new episodes hitting every Friday after. The show once again has an all-star cast, headed up by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXTNtN"&gt;Here’s Apple’s summary for the new season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FWagLm"&gt;Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds “The Morning Show” team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley’s (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X20sDO"&gt;Steve Carell also returns, and there are a number of new actors in the second season. One is Hasan Minhaj, who plays a new member of the eponymous “The Morning Show.” (&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported on Minhaj joining the cast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564529/hasan-minhaj-the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt; following the cancellation of his &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/patriot-act-with-hasan-minhaj-canceled-at-netflix-4047572/"&gt;Netflix comedy / news talk show&lt;/a&gt;.) Will Arnett also makes a surprise appearance in the trailer — his casting wasn’t previously known.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it has pay equity, but an informal employee survey suggests otherwise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FSFK27wYEtHQCq6saovGyjrJ9qI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764124/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KXgRUx"&gt;An early analysis of the informal Apple pay equity survey shows a six percent wage gap between the salaries of men and women, according to software engineer Cher Scarlett. It’s similar to the gender wage gap in San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://hired.com/h/wage-inequality-report/2021/"&gt;which hovers around five percent&lt;/a&gt;, but disappointing for a company that claims people of all genders “earn the same when engaging in similar work with comparable experience and performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgWsrH"&gt;The results are not scientific — employees opted into the survey and only 2,000 people responded (out of the &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/_10-K-2020-(As-Filed).pdf"&gt;147,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; Apple estimated in 2020)  — but they point to why some employees are suspicious of the company’s claim that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12371204/apple-diversity-report-pay-gap-hiring-equal-pay"&gt;it fixed its pay equity problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOHxCk"&gt;“We know pay equity was a problem in the past and Apple did something to fix it, but we’re having this conversation again because we’re seeing gaps in certain areas of the company and we want to know what Apple will do to prevent it from happening year-over-year,” Scarlett says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWuHQm"&gt;A small group of Apple employees, including Scarlett and members of the data analysis organization, will present the results to Apple’s people team this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVXR64"&gt;Scarlett also says she found that there were far fewer women, non-binary, and non-white people in senior positions at the company — or in technical roles, which are typically among the highest paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bdfPUh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Honestly, without seeing the data team analyze the salaries, the most disturbing thing I noticed about this data is  the disparity between the gender demographics between white and non-white respondents. Out of nearly 2,000 people... it's alarming. &lt;a href="https://t.co/idvfVhQDD3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/idvfVhQDD3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1426434491069861895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nfoiAx"&gt;“These charts suggest that white men have much more opportunities to advance within the company, and are more likely to be working in technical roles than less represented demographics,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1426664223053008896"&gt;she wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwQIhH"&gt;Scarlett knows the survey isn’t conclusive. “We’re not trying to draw definitive conclusions, we’re trying to get some insight because we’ve had none,” she explains. “What we actually want is for Apple to do a third-party investigation into salary data, or an audit that we have insight into.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fq1Uf1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was granted access to the survey data, which offers evidence of a salary gap among the respondents. We analyzed the survey data by isolating the approximately 1,400 technical roles, then grouping them by job level, gender, and race&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;We then found the median salaries for the job level as a whole, as well as the race and gender breakdowns within that job level. We went with the median value to smooth out any skewing that could come from outliers (which can easily crop up in user-provided data). The approach did not take into account things like college degrees or years of experience. We chose not to look at the non-technical respondents, as there were only around 520. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BNxksb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re trying to get some insight because we’ve had none”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NBIA0M"&gt;Scarlett pushed back on the idea that there weren’t enough non-technical responses to merit analysis, noting that it might be harder for those employees to find out about the survey in the first place. “It’s easy to fall into the idea that the sample size is small so it should be set aside,” she says. “But the fact is I don’t work in retail and the places where I post mostly go to people in the software organization. So retail and support responses come in organically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwz51J"&gt;Among the survey respondents in the data given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the median pay for men in mid-level technical roles was 6.25 percent higher than the median pay of women, while the median pay for white employees in mid-level technical roles was 5.06 percent higher than that of non-white employees. This sample was 944 white men out of 1,408 total respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHg50D"&gt;The median number of stock grants (restricted stock units) for non-white workers in entry-level and mid-level technical roles was roughly 11 percent lower than the median number of RSUs for white workers among survey respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRmIgu"&gt;Higher levels of the engineering organization show a partial reversal in this trend. The median pay for women in principal engineering roles is 1.2 percent higher than the median pay of men among survey respondents — but Scarlett is wary of the results. “Men in those high roles are less likely to respond to the survey because they’re the highest paid in the company, outside of leadership,” she says. There were far fewer respondents in this category than for mid-level technical roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LbZifW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The median pay for men in mid-level technical roles was 6.25 percent higher than the median pay of women&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37Qfl8"&gt;Scarlett started the survey after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;shut down previous attempts for employees to gather pay data&lt;/a&gt;. “I don’t think anyone is going into this saying there for sure is a wage gap, whether that’s gender or race or disability,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a previous interview. “But it is concerning to everyone that every single time someone tries to create more transparency, Apple shuts it down.” The company reportedly told employees that the previous surveys contained personally identifiable information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoZjGr"&gt;One Apple employee who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said an Apple director discouraged employees from taking the survey during an all-hands meeting last week. “A lot of us had the same thought that what he was saying was not great, it felt antiquated,” the source said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iY72dN"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/technology/apple-shareholders-show-their-support-for-tim-cook.html"&gt;Tim Cook told shareholders&lt;/a&gt; that women at Apple made 99.6 cents on the dollar compared to men, and underrepresented minorities made 99.7 cents on the dollar compared to white employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpzfV5"&gt;The company later said it fixed the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWPMl0"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Apple spokesperson Rachel Tulley sent the company’s already public statement on pay equity: “Apple has a firm and long‑standing commitment to pay equity. Globally, employees of all genders earn the same when engaging in similar work with comparable experience and performance. In the United States, the same is true for employees of all races and ethnicities. We don’t ask for salary history during the recruiting process. Our recruiters base offers on Apple employees in similar roles. And every year, we examine the compensation employees receive and ensure that we maintain pay equity.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is giving customers a free year of Apple TV Plus</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0n2u1d"&gt;T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Ft-mobile-apple-tv-on-us&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a new promotional perk&lt;/a&gt; for its customers: starting on August 25th, both new and existing subscribers to its Magenta and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max&lt;/a&gt; plans can get a year’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscription to Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGx288"&gt;The deal applies to virtually any of T-Mobile’s post-paid customers that it classifies as part of those plans, including its Magenta 55 Plus, Magenta Military, Magenta First Responders, Sprint Unlimited Plus, Sprint Premium, and T-Mobile for Business plans. Better yet, the deal isn’t just for newcomers to T-Mobile; it seems that anyone subscribing to those plans can get the free year of Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tew1Ky"&gt;Customers under T-Mobile’s Magenta, Magenta Max, and T-Mobile for Business can find the offer listed under their rate plan details on T-Mobile’s website or app to get the free year, while customers who are still under Sprint’s umbrella will have to go to T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promotional site&lt;/a&gt; and apply the code 2021APPLETVP1 to get the offer. (Regular T-Mobile customers can do that, too, should they prefer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nGr6x0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Watch ‘Foundation’ for free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKhcRS"&gt;T-Mobile also notes that the free 12 months on offer here will seemingly apply even if you’ve had a subscription or trial to Apple TV Plus before, meaning that customers can stack the deal with other free trials, like the three months of service that come with the purchase of a new Apple device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96944Y"&gt;The freebie also comes as T-Mobile is reckoning with its recent massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, which exposed data for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;millions of its customers&lt;/a&gt;, including first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license / ID numbers, phone numbers, and IMEI / IMSI information for 7.8 million postpaid customers. Additionally, T-Mobile says that data on over 40 million “former or prospective customers” was compromised in the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6kuAz"&gt;And while it’s certainly a nice bonus for customers, it’s likely that a few months of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;will not make up for having to deal with the ramifications of having that much personal data leaked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Higher-end Mac Mini reportedly landing ‘in the next several months’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBFfHymdXYfeBiDV-vf6brqPHkI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69762377/cwelch_201114_4292_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The port configuration on the current M1 Mac Mini. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vepgj9"&gt;Apple is planning a new model of the Mac Mini that will replace the pro-focused Intel-based model it still sells, according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman’s &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter. A “high-end, M1X Mac Mini” is expected “in the next several months,” and is said to have “an updated design and more ports than the current model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itZkyK"&gt;Apple released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini with its own M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; late last year, but that model was intended as a replacement for the entry-level machines, and consequently had fewer ports than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18097117/apple-mac-mini-2018-review-upgrade-faster-more-powerful-features-price"&gt;higher-end Intel version introduced in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The M1 Mini has two fewer Thunderbolt ports, only one of which can be used for an external display, although a second monitor can still be hooked up over HDMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XvKJ1U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Mac mini with M1 review: over-performer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="us03Zf"&gt;If the “M1X” nomenclature is accurate, it would suggest that the new model uses the same generation CPU cores as the M1 (and the A14 Bionic chip used in the iPhone 12), but achieves better performance by having more CPU and GPU cores across a larger chip. That was Apple’s approach to designing the “X” processors for previous iPad models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SM0LFU"&gt;The current M1 Mac Mini is a great computer, but it does have its limitations for pro use, and there’s a sense that its design — virtually unchanged since 2010 — could use an overhaul. Gurman has mentioned the prospect of a new Mac Mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, and he now seems surer than ever that it’s actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LV8f67"&gt;The red Apple Watch Series 6 has already seen an array of big discounts, but you don’t always get nice pricing on the more subtle colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are both currently offering $75 off the handsome navy-colored watch, as well as the white model, bringing them down to $325. Walmart also has a few more colors available at the same price, and both offer the red at an additional $6 markdown. In addition to a myriad of fun colors, Apple’s latest and greatest wearable also offers built-in sleep tracking, a blood oxygen sensor, and an always-on display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="u2Eaty"&gt;Amazon and Google may be paving the way toward a smarter home, but not every device under the sun touts smart capabilities yet. Luckily, there are devices like TP-Link’s Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini. The simple, voice-enabled device works with virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as IFTTT, giving you an easy way to control your plugs via Wi-Fi and set a schedule. Normally $18, you can grab TP-Link’s compact smart plug at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749634942986522554" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ftp-link-wifi-mini-smart%2F-%2FA-52107189" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target for $10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YUqPyP"&gt;If you own a PlayStation 4 or the PlayStation 5, a subscription to PlayStation Plus is really a no-brainer. The premium service grants you access to online multiplayer, free monthly titles, and 100GB of cloud storage, along with exclusive deals on select games, add-ons, and preorders. It also lets you take advantage of the PlayStation Plus collection, a catalog that contains some of the best PlayStation games to date, including hits such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17223854/god-of-war-review-ps4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Remastered&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/3/8339241/bloodborne-is-a-blood-soaked-bone-splintering-masterpiece-on-ps4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Best of all, if you’re a new subscriber, you can land a 12-month subscription to &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/IP9101-NPIA90005_01-PSPLUSDIS50OFF1Y/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus for just $30&lt;/a&gt; through August 30th, half off what it would typically cost for Sony’s landmark service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ClAtmV"&gt;We’ve been tracking this deal on the AirPods Pro — the best one since Black Friday — for a few days now. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are still offering $70 off a new set of the popular noise-canceling earbuds, bringing the final sale price down to $180. Not only are the true wireless earbuds built around the Apple-designed H1 chip, which gives them always-on support for Siri, but they feature great noise cancellation and deep integration with iOS, adding to their convenience. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="juoMF5"&gt;To celebrate &lt;em&gt;Quake’s&lt;/em&gt; 25th anniversary and the game’s wider release on consoles, Steam is offering big discounts on many great games as part of its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/bethesda/sale/quakecon2021?snr=1_4_4__118" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QuakeCon sale&lt;/a&gt;. You can currently take your pick from a plethora of solid titles, including entries from the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Dishonored franchises, though, personally, we recommend the modern Doom titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yevur5"&gt;The widely beloved &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 2016 title responsible for ripping and tearing the classic franchise back from the brink of potential obscurity, is just $5 (50 percent off). Last year’s sequel, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is $15 (75 percent off), and even &lt;em&gt;Eternal’s&lt;/em&gt; two DLC expansions, &lt;em&gt;The Ancient Gods&lt;/em&gt; Parts &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098292/DOOM_Eternal_The_Ancient_Gods__Part_One/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098293/DOOM_Eternal_The_Ancient_Gods__Part_Two/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, are 50 percent off or available together for $15 as the &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098291/DOOM_Eternal_Year_One_Pass/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Year One Pass&lt;/a&gt;. That is a ton of collective hours of fast-action, FPS chaos for cheap. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doom Eternal &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
