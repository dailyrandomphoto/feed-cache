    <title>Apple just banned a pay equity Slack channel but lets fun dogs channel lie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JWVCQwr9uJNoWOPcE2IibS19BNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799661/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esd1Pe"&gt;Apple has barred employees from creating a Slack channel to discuss pay equity. A member of the employee relations team, Apple’s version of HR, said that while the topic was “aligned with Apple’s commitment to pay equity,” it did not meet the company’s Slack Terms of Use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIofAS"&gt;“Slack channels are provided to conduct Apple business and must advance the work, deliverables, or mission of Apple departments and teams,” the employee relations representative told employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yw7RUv"&gt;The company’s rules for the in-office chat app say that “Slack channels for activities and hobbies not recognized as Apple Employee clubs or Diversity Network Associations (DNAs) aren’t permitted and shouldn’t be created.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fy9v7"&gt;But that rule has not been evenly enforced. Currently, Apple employees have popular Slack channels to discuss #fun-dogs (more than 5,000 members), #gaming (more than 3,000 members), and #dad-jokes (more than 2,000 members). On August 18th, the company approved a channel called #community-foosball. The cat and dog channels are not part of official clubs, and all of these channels were specifically created to talk about non-work activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3HsKp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A clear cut act of retaliation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkWApN"&gt;Employment attorney Vincent P. White says that invoking the Slack terms may simply be an excuse to block discussions of workplace pay disparities since doing so outright would violate labor law. “Discussing pay equity is a protected activity under federal, state, and local law,” says White. “Everyone agrees on that. For them to try and impair employees’ ability to discuss pay equity and diversity in the workplace is a clear cut act of retaliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpAc4Z"&gt;Pay equity has been a hot topic among Apple employees over the past few months. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;shut down multiple employee surveys&lt;/a&gt; aimed at gathering data on how much workers make. One survey, started by Apple engineer Cher Scarlett, has seemingly been allowed to stay up. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22633141/apple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap"&gt;early analysis of the results&lt;/a&gt; showed a 6 percent wage gap between the salaries of men and women who participated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWD00m"&gt;Now, organizers want to create a space for employees to discuss pay issues. While Apple previously said it did not have a pay equity problem, employees are suspicious. The company’s recent behavior, including shutting down pay surveys and now banning a pay equity Slack channel, has only exacerbated those concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P26x2q"&gt;“It sure is very convenient for Apple that these Terms of Use that they wrote are extremely useful for crushing free and open communication among employees,” one source says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgBDEg"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Apple Watch may be delayed due to manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Dip8joi6vMbZfwteRY8D3OW2vg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799013/vpavic_200929_4216_0137.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y7rr4A"&gt;The next Apple Watch is experiencing manufacturing issues that could lead to the product being released later than expected, according to separate reports from &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Watch-production-delayed-as-engineers-wrestle-with-quality-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-31/apple-s-new-watch-will-likely-be-delayed-over-production-snags"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The potential delay is reportedly due to complexities in the smartwatch’s new design, which is rumored to include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;flat sides and bigger screens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te1ypv"&gt;Sources told &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; that small-scale production for the next Apple Watch had begun but that it encountered “critical challenges in reaching satisfactory production performance.” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported similar details. Production has now been “temporarily halted” while Apple and its suppliers work to solve the manufacturing issues ahead of eventual mass production, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AiXY9p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The next Apple Watch is expected to be called the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Se0EIi"&gt;The new Apple Watch, expected to be called the Apple Watch Series 7, will see screen size increases to 41mm and 45mm (a 1mm bump from the currently available options), a faster processor, and “a flatter display and edges,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman reported &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;in his Power On newsletter on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. While Gurman reported that the Series 7 won’t bring any big health upgrades “until at least next year,” &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports that the new Watch will add new features “such as blood pressure measurement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh9V18"&gt;Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 6 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21430844/apple-event-recap-biggest-announcements-watch-series-6-se-ipad-air"&gt;at an event last September&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is expected to host another September product event this year. Given these reported production challenges with the next Apple Watch, if Apple does host a September event, there’s a possibility the Apple Watch might not make an appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZL4Ty"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moment’s new video-coloring app Grain will let you take handcrafted presets to other apps </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gkFzLvUouOGyEtDhngfRZIvvxZc=/326x0:3770x2296/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798634/grain_press_color_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VScVpG"&gt;Moment &lt;a href="https://apps.shopmoment.com/grain"&gt;is launching another video-focused app&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone and iPad Tuesday that lets you edit and color footage as well as create video presets or “looks” for use on social media or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147761/moment-rtro-video-app-retro-filters-stories-ios-iphone"&gt;Moment’s other video app, Rtro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ9Q30"&gt;The app is called Grain, and based on my experience with it in beta form, it seems to offer a lot of video settings to get lost in. Grain breaks its editing options into three categories: color, effects, and overlays. Color has a variety of preset filters to start with, like LoFi, 35mm, or Blockbuster, which you can then further customize with adjustments to color temperature, brightness, or saturation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IY0oSC"&gt;Effects and overlay presets work similarly. You can add film grain, light bleeds, blurs, VHS effects, faux film stocks and fine-tune them with granular controls. Grain also offers gestures to add or remove filters, but I quickly forgot they were an option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5_vQw8PzbC4WV8cyO8t4-YbNu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808038/Grain_App_WebRes399.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grain offers granular control over individual effects, including more professional-grade tools like color wheels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tQy84I"&gt;As someone who is at best an amateur videographer, the amount of control you can have over an individual video clip can be daunting. Luckily, Grain is designed for as much or as little experimentation as you want. You can produce something interesting just by selecting a color filter and a video effect without diving into menus for fine-tuning. (Though you could arguably just as easily do too much that way.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cFlcCyTWnffTwqAogCsm4AIdDGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808040/Image__2_.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots of my own disastrous attempt at coloring a clip of my dog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2sRtL"&gt;Video presets you create can be saved for later use or exported as a LUT (Lookup Table) for use in professional desktop software like Adobe Premiere Pro. Grain can also send your presets to Moment’s other video app, Rtro, if you prefer your modified presets to the filters Moment sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYi2xo"&gt;The catch with Grain is that to get all of the features, you have to be willing to pay. Grain charges $4.99 per month, $29.99 per year, or a one-time payment of $69.99 to unlock advanced color editing tools, unlimited video length, and the ability to export LUTs and overlays. Otherwise, you’re stuck with the basics, and the novel ability to send filters to Rtro. Moment also plans to bundle subscriptions to Grain and Rtro for $6.99 per month or $39.99 per year if you like both apps enough to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The makers of the GorillaPod made a MagSafe tripod mount</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Joby GripTight tripod mount" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r_NSg1BizLHuuko7dtawyAsKDP4=/1x0:3939x2625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798383/griptightmount.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Joby&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CF95F3"&gt;Joby has released a MagSafe mount for tripods that should simplify the process of attaching an iPhone 12 and any future iPhone models that support MagSafe. The new GripTight mount allows for quick attachment, letting the mount hold on to your phone either by just its MagSafe magnet or with a more secure option that tightly grips the edges of your phone like Joby’s previous smartphone mounts. With the latter use case, people may not know that you’re partially connected to the GripTight mount with MagSafe, but at least you’ll know it in your heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8d4i2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjoby.com%2Fus-en%2Fgriptight-mount-for-magsafe-jb01752-bww%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22650174%2Fjoby-gorillapod-tripod-wall-mount-magnet-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This new mount is available now for $23.97 from Joby’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and it works on the company’s line of flexible GorillaPod tripods as well as any other tripods that support the industry standard 1/4-20-inch thread. The clamp can rotate 360 degrees so that you can switch between portrait and landscape shooting modes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Joby GripTight wall mount" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gH_htMQ-oB-ZKGQirrfXPWbbtr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817056/griptightwallmount.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Joby&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g5HH5B"&gt;Additionally, the company announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjoby.com%2Fus-en%2Fgriptight-wall-mount-for-magsafe-jb01754-bww%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22650174%2Fjoby-gorillapod-tripod-wall-mount-magnet-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the GripTight MagSafe wall mount that costs $14.97&lt;/a&gt;. One side sticks to your iPhone 12 via the MagSafe magnet, while the other side has a sticky surface that lets it fasten to flat nonporous surfaces, like glass. Joby says you can restore its stickiness by rinsing it with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yu9Zzj"&gt;Support for MagSafe as a means to charge phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;hasn’t really picked up in a huge way&lt;/a&gt;, but at least more accessory makers like Joby and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608012/otterbox-magsafe-compatible-gaming-clip-xbox-controller-price-iphone-12-mini-pro-max"&gt;OtterBox&lt;/a&gt; have devised ways to take advantage of the magnet within each of Apple’s latest iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue bulbs are discounted in the lead up to Labor Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R3vJKoffF5qGEIip7f4lbqb77CI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69797568/Philips_Hue_E26_smart_bulbs_press_image.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Now through September 12th, you can buy three Philips Hue bulbs for the price of two.  | Image: Philips&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lQJKuv"&gt;The upcoming Labor Day holiday signals the end of summer and the ramp-up of everything from the school year to new gadget season. While you can expect to get plenty of Labor Day-related deals from us coming very shortly, Philips has gotten a bit of a head start with their “Summer of Hue” savings promo, so you’re not stuck with having a single shade of lighting after Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAhEvs"&gt;Right now, Philips is offering three &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750589459180759559#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white and color smart bulbs &lt;/a&gt;for the price of two, shaving $35 off the cost of some of the most popular smart home lights through September 12th. The vibrant E26 Hue bulbs allow for funky lighting while offering a full spectrum of 16 million colors, as well the flexibility to stretch from a warm white to daylight-balanced cool white with up to 800 lumens of brightness. As the fall months come around, it can be refreshing to have color temperature options at your disposal to try and keep your mental state up, or at the very least to have adjustable smart timers for when the daytime hours get shorter. This is a great way to get into the Philips Hue ecosystem — the E26 bulbs can work with a Hue Bridge or without one via Bluetooth — or build up the stock of lights already set up in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sLBJMs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Philips Hue gets a sleeker new app rebuilt ‘from the ground up’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465734/philips-hue-app-update-rebuilt-grid-view"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="mwF6P4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10649409"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TuGrn6"&gt;The world of gaming-focused accessories is flush with excessive RGB lighting, over-engineered aesthetics, and hard-edged design lines. If you’re looking for more subdued styling that doesn’t sacrifice performance, however, there’s the Logitech G Pro wireless mouse. The excellent peripheral has all the tenets of a gaming mouse, including a lightweight build and customizable DPI sensitivity, but with a look that could pass in either an esports tournament or an office. Its functionality extends a bit further, too, by allowing fully ambidextrous control, with a symmetrical design and swappable side button layouts. Normally $130, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GCKQD77?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; currently has the Logitech G Pro for $85, its cheapest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EAyinz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10726674"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W7Rzyk"&gt;The Studio Buds are a recent release from Apple-owned Beats, one that offers some unique features that separate it from the bevy of AirPods on the market. First off, the bold-colored Beats utilize a USB-C charging port as opposed to Lightning, making them more accessible and useful for Android users. They also support various Android features and offer active noise cancellation, which, while not as strong as the competition, still renders them a great pair of true wireless earbuds for working out or traveling. Amazon currently has the stylish &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SSCV5K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red model for $130&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off), which is a historical low for pair of earbuds that just launched in June. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Speyns"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10693512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D7zmHR"&gt;If you’re looking for another deal on true wireless earbuds, the Jabra Elite 75t are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more than 33 percent off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $100. These earbuds are a great alternative for multi-device users, or those who want some low-end punch while listening to tunes. They’re not as new as the aforementioned pair of Beats, but upon review, our colleague and seasoned headphone aficionado Chris Welch called them the best AirPods alternative. Considering the current price, the Jabra Elite 75t are a formidable competitor to standard AirPods and will make life a little easier if you’re someone who prefers to avoid Apple’s ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lfqwzf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kyuIx1"&gt;The original Apple Pencil became the butt of many jokes across the tech space when everyone saw how it charged — we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;weren’t a fan&lt;/a&gt;, either. Thankfully, unlike the first-gen model, the latest Apple Pencil charges when magnetically attached to your iPad. It also supports gestures and is compatible with both the iPad Pro and the latest iPad Air.

    <title>Apple and Google must allow developers to use other payment systems, new Korean law declares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6vtfjWbmqr8esuAJJkmBtb-Xlvc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69796907/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="blzh29"&gt;South Korea has passed a bill written to prevent major platform owners like Google and Apple from restricting app developers to built-in payment systems, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-apple-hit-in-south-korea-by-worlds-first-law-ending-their-dominance-over-app-store-payments-11630403335?st=dh3dbi4h20et6lc&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The bill is now expected to be signed into law by President Moon Jae-in, whose party championed the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIrgCu"&gt;The law comes as a blow to Google and Apple who both require in-app purchases to flow only through their systems, instead of outside payment processors, allowing the tech giants to collect a 30 percent cut. If tech companies fail to comply with the new law, they could face fines of up to 3 percent of their South Korea revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNYI55"&gt;The law is &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210824010651320"&gt;an amendment to South Korea’s Telecommunications Business Act&lt;/a&gt;, and it could have a large impact on how Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store do business globally. South Korea’s National Assembly passed the bill on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GoDypm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neither company is happy about it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BuinVx"&gt;Neither company is happy about it. In a statement, Google defended its service fees, which it says “helps keep Android free,” and gives developers “the tools and global platform to access billions of consumers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQ4yQH"&gt;“Just as it costs developers money to build an app, it costs us money to build and maintain an operating system and app store,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ll reflect on how to comply with this law while maintaining a model that supports a high-quality operating system and app store, and we will share more in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cakKxF"&gt;A representative from Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;However, prior to the law’s passing, the company sent over the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WQK7nh"&gt;The proposed Telecommunications Business Act will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases, and features like “Ask to Buy” and Parental Controls will become less effective. We believe user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this proposal—leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WiFTPR"&gt;Lobbyists for the two companies have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/technology/apple-google-south-korea-app-store.html"&gt;reportedly argued to American officials&lt;/a&gt; that the Korean legislation violates a trade agreement, as it seeks to control the actions of US-based companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ie3QNX"&gt;South Korea isn’t the only country that’s trying to bend American tech giants to its will. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334641/apple-follows-russian-default-apps-law-setup-screen-options-user"&gt;Russia requires that gadgets come pre-installed&lt;/a&gt; with apps made by Russian developers, and  &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-considering-new-laws-apple-google-wechat-digital-wallets-2021-08-30/"&gt;Australia is looking into regulating services&lt;/a&gt; like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Some in the US government have even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;proposed legislation similar&lt;/a&gt; to what was passed by South Korea. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes that South Korea’s new legislation could end up being referenced by regulators in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnA8Nj"&gt;Both Apple and Google have been trying to stave off such actions through changes to their store policies. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;introduced its App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;, which halved Apple’s cut from developers earning less than a million dollars a year on its store. It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;agreed to let developers&lt;/a&gt; inform their users about payment options outside the App Store, using the email addresses that users gave them. Google said that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;only take 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; of developers' first million dollars instead of 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfkiI9"&gt;Both Apple and Google have faced legal challenges despite the changes, with the most notable coming from Epic Games. Epic argued that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; used their dominant positions to dictate what could and could not be done with their phones. While Epic’s argument is different against each company, they share the same core complaint: Apple and Google’s dominance over the app stores. Both cases are still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYAzT8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 31st, 7:21AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added new statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13’s rumored satellite link sounds like it’s just for emergencies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTbREU_Xs0DW0aQhAlHaVr2kmEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69795964/vpavic_4243_20201017_0077.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dqc8Bg"&gt;Apple plans to let you connect your iPhone to satellites so you can contact emergency services in areas that don’t have cellular coverage, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/apple-plans-to-add-satellite-features-to-iphones-for-emergencies?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to a new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;article was published after Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Sunday that the iPhone 13 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647252/the-iphone-13-5g-leo-satellite"&gt;may be able to make satellite calls&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo often reveals details about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/17/18682820/apple-5g-iphone-2020-oled-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18228861/apple-iphone-kuo-rumor-ipad-ipod-touch-airpower-airpods"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; before the company officially announces them, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; sources indicate that Apple’s approach for iPhone satellite connectivity may be more limited to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYJAg9"&gt;One feature, called Emergency Message via Satellite, will let you text emergency services and emergency contacts when you don’t have a cell signal by harnessing a satellite network, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. These messages will have a length limit and be represented as a grey bubble instead of the green used for SMS messages and the blue used for iMessages. And when you’re sending one of these messages to an emergency contact, it will reportedly push through even if they have Do Not Disturb mode turned on, which could help ensure that your message is seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4cpaQd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New emergency reporting features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S15bkM"&gt;Another feature will let users report emergencies. “The phone will ask what kind of emergency is happening, such as whether it involves a car, boat, plane or fire,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. You’ll also be able to send information such as your location and your Medical ID (which you can set up in the Health app). You may also be able to notify emergency contacts at the same time you report an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1E08p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the next iPhone might have the required hardware to make satellite calls. But a source tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that the new features probably won’t be ready before next year, throwing cold water on the idea that you might be able to use them as soon as you buy the next iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ceva6Y"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OW6pDa"&gt;The new satellite link features, if they are released, could help ease fears about being able to contact emergency services in a time of need or when you’re away from a cellular network. There’s also the possibility the features could provide another way to get in touch with emergency services in the event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494652/911-outage-centurylink-lumen-intrado"&gt;of 911 outages&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17515464/att-911-emergency-outage-fine-fcc-2017"&gt;do&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/17/8990735/t-mobile-17-5-million-911-outages-fcc"&gt;happen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8244041/fcc-verizon-911-outage-fine"&gt;occasionally&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple sets debut date for The Problem with Jon Stewart</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B9KmDa"&gt;Apple’s upcoming show starring Jon Stewart, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, will debut on Apple TV Plus on September 30th, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-announces-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-is-set-to-make-its-global-debut-thursday-september-30-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648861%2Fapple-tv-plus-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-show-premiere-debut-date-podcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-announces-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-is-set-to-make-its-global-debut-thursday-september-30-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648861%2Fapple-tv-plus-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-show-premiere-debut-date-podcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;describes the show&lt;/a&gt; as a “multiple-season, single-issue series, taking a deep dive on the issues affecting us most.” It will also have &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-problem-with-jon-stewart/id1583132133"&gt;a companion podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which will “extend the conversation from each episode.” New episodes of the TV show will premiere every other week, while new episodes of the podcast will be released weekly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Za6UJQ"&gt;Apple released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBMqejibrGg"&gt;a short teaser&lt;/a&gt; to promote the premiere date that features Stewart wondering, “what the hell happened to my face?” You can also listen to a &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-problem-with-jon-stewart/id1583132133?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1&amp;amp;itscg=80085&amp;amp;itsct=pod_show_appletv_tpwjs"&gt;teaser of the podcast right now&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s only 15 seconds long and doesn’t give us a great idea of what the podcast will actually be like. In July, Stewart promoted the upcoming show with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585674/jon-stewart-apple-tv-show-skit-roasting-space-billionaires-jason-alexander"&gt;an odd video skewering the billionaire space race&lt;/a&gt; that starred Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple buys classical music streaming service Primephonic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQCZ9Gr0fjFTQSuVqmTBjYhnLmA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793751/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZMern"&gt;Apple Music is pushing more extensively into classical music. Today, Apple announced that it has acquired &lt;a href="https://www.primephonic.com/"&gt;Primephonic&lt;/a&gt;, a service that specializes in streaming the classical genre, and will incorporate the app’s functionality and playlists into Apple Music. The result will be “a significantly improved classical music experience,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-acquires-classical-music-streaming-service-primephonic%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648604%2Fapple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-streaming-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be a standalone Apple Music classical app coming sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBTHxN"&gt;Effective immediately, Primephonic is no longer accepting new customers, and the service as it exists today will shut down on September 7th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X85KIJ"&gt;Apple says Primephonic’s playlists and “exclusive audio content” will be first to be integrated into Apple Music. Down the line, it’ll add “the best features of Primephonic, including better browsing and search capabilities by composer and by repertoire, detailed displays of classical music metadata, plus new features and benefits.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn9ZSb"&gt;In a show of how serious Apple is about appealing to classical fans, the company says “a dedicated classical music app” will launch next year that will use Primephonic’s “classical user interface that fans have grown to love.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZrAiO"&gt;Primephonic launched three years ago, and its team says this deal is about scale and reaching more listeners. “As a classical-only startup, we can not reach the majority of global classical listeners, especially those that listen to many other music genres as well,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.primephonic.com/"&gt;a note on its webpage&lt;/a&gt;. “We therefore concluded that in order to achieve our mission, we need to partner with a leading streaming service that encompasses all music genres and also shares our love for classical music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JPDEw"&gt;According to Primephonic’s FAQ, customers with an active subscription will receive a prorated refund. They’ll also be getting a code to redeem six free months of Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfbxSn"&gt;As I wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;my early review of Apple Music’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, classical lends itself extremely well to Dolby Atmos mixes — so I’m looking forward to the service evolving into a better home for the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple cares about privacy, unless you work at Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_vkm8vk7K3TJmJbPOjZRKE5RhsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793705/acastro_210828_4732_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company has taken a strong stance on safeguarding its customers’ data — but some employees don’t believe it protects theirs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="i72298"&gt;Jacob Preston was sitting down with his manager during his first week at Apple when he was told, with little fanfare, that he needed to link his personal Apple ID and work account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a66Mno"&gt;The request struck him as odd. Like anyone who owns an Apple product, Preston’s Apple ID was intimately tied to his personal data — it connected his devices to the company’s various services, including his iCloud backups. How could he be sure his personal messages and documents wouldn’t land on his work laptop? Still, he was too giddy about his new job as a firmware engineer to care. He went ahead and linked the accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7C692k"&gt;Three years later, when Preston handed in his resignation, the choice came back to haunt him. His manager told him to return his work laptop, and — per Apple protocol — said he shouldn’t wipe the computer’s hard drive. His initial worry had come to pass: his personal messages were on this work laptop, as were private documents concerning his taxes and a recent home loan. Preston pushed back, saying some of the files contained highly personal information and there was no reasonable way to make sure they were all removed from the laptop without wiping it completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JTFGIN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If they did this to a customer, people would lose their goddamn minds.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DHpRb1"&gt;He was told the policy wasn’t negotiable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8jpj8"&gt;Preston’s story is part of a growing tension inside Apple, where some employees say the company isn’t doing enough to protect their personal privacy and, at times, actively seeks to invade it for security reasons. Employees have been asked to install software builds on their phones to test out new features prior to launch — only to find the builds expose their personal messages. Others have found that when testing new products like Apple’s Face ID, images are recorded every time they open their phones. “If they did this to a customer, people would lose their goddamn minds,” says Ashley Gjøvik, a senior engineering program manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fATl5U"&gt;Apple employees also can’t use their work email addresses to sign up for iCloud accounts, so many use their personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rw557J"&gt;The blurring of personal and work accounts has resulted in some unusual situations, including Gjøvik allegedly being forced to hand compromising photos of herself to Apple lawyers when her team became involved in an unrelated legal dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5fNLD"&gt;Underpinning all of this is a stringent employment agreement that gives Apple the right to conduct extensive employee surveillance, including “physical, video, or electronic surveillance” as well as the ability to “search your workspace such as file cabinets, desks, and offices (even if locked), review phone records, or search any non-Apple property (such as backpacks, purses) on company premises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGA1QT"&gt;Apple also tells employees that they should have “no expectation of privacy when using &lt;em&gt;your or someone else’s personal devices for Apple business&lt;/em&gt;, when using Apple systems or networks, or when on Apple premises” (emphasis added). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXwTkm"&gt;Many employees have a choice between getting an Apple-owned phone or having the company pay for their phone plan. But one source tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that trying to maintain two phones can become impractical. In software engineering, certain employees are expected to participate in a “live-on” program that puts out daily builds with bug fixes. “You can’t have a successful live-on program without people treating these devices exactly the same as a personal phone,” the source says. “So a work device or a work account just won’t cut it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OHPENx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You must link your personal Apple ID with your AppleConnect work account”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gcIeVu"&gt;None of these policies are unique. Tech companies almost always have rules in place to search employees’ corporate devices, including personal devices used for work. It’s also common practice for tech companies to ask employees to test new software, which could potentially expose personal information. But Apple sets itself apart from other tech giants through its commitment to consumer privacy. As &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-initiative"&gt;Tim Cook said at the CPDP Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in January 2021&lt;/a&gt;, businesses built on buying and selling user data, without the knowledge or consent of consumers, “[degrade] our fundamental right to privacy first, and our social fabric by consequence.” The lack of employee privacy has made the perceived hypocrisy particularly irksome to some workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAgJJd"&gt;Now, as employees begin to push back against a variety of Apple norms and rules, these policies are coming under the spotlight, raising the question of whether the company has done enough to safeguard personal employee data. It might seem like a company obsessed with secrecy would be sympathetic to its employees’ wishes to have confidential information of their own. But at Apple, secrecy requires the opposite: extensive knowledge, and control, over its workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="W0EPAn"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fX9LEK"&gt;This is how it starts: a new Apple employee is told during onboarding that collaborating with their colleagues will require them to make extensive use of iCloud storage, and their manager offers a two terabyte upgrade. This will link their personal Apple ID to their work account — in fact, the instructions for accessing this upgrade explicitly say “you must link your personal Apple ID with your AppleConnect work account.” The connection will give them access to collaborative apps like Pages and Numbers that they might need to do their jobs. (Apple employees who do not have a business need to collaborate do not go through this process.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sL0ABq"&gt;Employees &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; pause during onboarding and say they want to create a new Apple ID specifically for work or use a different phone. But most do not — it seems a little paranoid, and the Apple instructions say to go ahead and use your personal account. What’s more, most Apple devices don’t support using multiple Apple IDs. To switch between iCloud accounts on an iPhone, you have to completely sign out of one ID and into another — a clunky, disruptive process. It is far easier culturally and technically to simply link personal and work accounts, which adds a new Apple Work folder to the employee’s iCloud account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CYWXBP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I get mad that I have to use my personal phone to text my boss.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rsRVfM"&gt;In theory, this Apple Work folder is where all of the collaborative documents for employees are supposed to live in order to keep personal and work files separate. In practice, the owner of a document often forgets to store files in the work folder, and documents quickly become intermingled. In fact, when Apple employees create a document in, say, Pages, the app automatically enters the personal email address used for their Apple ID. “I asked my manager about it and it’s just sort of an issue everyone deals with,” Preston says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ9yZ8"&gt;Employees can choose to not sync certain folders, like their photo libraries. But others, like messages, can be trickier. Apple adopted Slack in 2019, but some teams still use iMessage as a primary way to communicate, which makes opting out of a message sync nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cND06r"&gt;Over the past few weeks, employees have been discussing the difficulty of setting up different Apple IDs to keep work and personal files separate, noting that while it’s possible, there are significant technical hurdles. “I don’t understand why they didn’t create an Apple ID and iCloud account from our work email address during the onboarding process,” one employee said on Slack. “I get mad that I have to use my personal phone to text my boss,” said another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Gb5oHV"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KX6B7I"&gt;Concerns about data privacy are not ubiquitous inside Apple. Many employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they were aware the company gave itself extensive rights to search their data, but — for various reasons — weren’t overly worried about the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HS4l18"&gt;“When I joined Apple, I personally expected it to be pretty invasive and took some serious steps to separate my work and personal life,” one source says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uvat9x"&gt;For other employees, however, the mixing of personal and work data has already had real consequences. In 2018, the engineering team Ashley Gjøvik worked on was involved in a lawsuit. The case had nothing to do with Gjøvik personally, but because she’d worked on a project related to the litigation, Apple lawyers needed to collect documents from her phone and work computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qMBbDh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All data that has your face in it is good data.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjR32s"&gt;Gjøvik asked the lawyers to confirm that they wouldn’t need to access her personal messages. She says her team discouraged the use of two phones; she used the same one for work and personal and, as a result, had private messages on her work device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWh2Gt"&gt;A member of the legal team responded that while the lawyers did not need to access Gjøvik’s photos, they did not want her to delete any messages. During an in-person meeting, Gjøvik says she told the lawyers the messages included nude photos she’d sent to a man she was dating — a sushi chef who lived in Hawaii. Surely, those weren’t relevant to the lawsuit. Could she delete them? She says the lawyers told her no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="n70Td0"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JxFw4s"&gt;In 2017, Apple rolled out an app called Gobbler that would allow employees to test Face ID before it became available to customers. The process was routine — Apple often launched new features or apps on employees’ phones, then collected data on how the technology was used to make sure it was ready for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwqUgC"&gt;Gobbler was unique in that it was designed to test face unlock for iPhones and iPads. This meant that every time an employee picked up their phone, the device recorded a short video — hopefully of their face. They could then file “problem reports” on Radar, Apple’s bug tracking system, and include the videos if they found a glitch in the system. “All data that has your face in it is good data,” said an internal email about the project. After rumors of criticism,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple eventually changed the codename to “Glimmer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pGlrWf"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Zoe Apple Feature|103688" data-volume-uuid="580d2e156" data-volume-id="103688" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-412" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jV2FDY"&gt;Unlike other Apple features, Glimmer wasn’t automatically installed on employee phones. It required an informed consent form so employees would know what they were getting into. Still, for some people on engineering teams, participation was encouraged — even expected, according to two staff members. Once it was installed, some data that didn’t contain personally identifiable information would automatically upload to Radar, unless employees turned off this setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Pznio"&gt;Apple was careful to instruct employees not to upload anything sensitive, confidential, or private. But it didn’t tell people what was happening with the hundreds of images they didn’t upload in Radar reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMLdGA"&gt;The reports themselves were also a cause for concern. When employees file Radar tickets, they include detailed information about the problems they are seeing. In 2019, Gjøvik filed a ticket about Apple’s photo search capabilities. “If I search for ‘infant’ in my photo library, it returns a selfie I took of myself in bed after laparoscopic surgery to treat my endometriosis,” she wrote, including four images in the ticket. The default sharing settings for the ticket included all of software engineering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o3fzws"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re the one tech company that takes privacy seriously.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gprojb"&gt;Radar tickets also are not removable. Even when the tickets are closed, they remain searchable. In training, employees say they are told: “Radar is forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFxerl"&gt;What’s more, when employees file Radar tickets, they are often asked to include diagnostic files, internally called “sysdiagnose” to give Apple more information about the problem. If they are filing a bug about iMessage, they might be asked to install a sysdiagnose profile that exposes their iMessages to the team tasked with fixing the issue. For employees using a live-on device, default settings can mean that, as they are filing a Radar ticket, a sysdiagnose profile is being automatically created in the background, sending data to Apple without the employee realizing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjiYsZ"&gt;When sysdiagnose profiles are not included, employees have been known to post memes calling out the omission. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/On4EnZwfGWeTJIUzgvtp5knMPOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814656/IMG_3D14F61845E9_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="apGDlX"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="g3Kohu"&gt;Gjøvik is currently on administrative leave from Apple due to an ongoing investigation into claims she made about harassment and a hostile work environment. If she leaves the company, she’ll likely face the same conundrum as Jacob Preston, related to the mixing of her personal and work files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ujrz0L"&gt;Employees likely wouldn’t care too much about this were it not for another Apple rule that bars them from wiping their devices when they leave the company. If they do, they’ll be in direct violation of their employment agreement, leaving them vulnerable to legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG6d7p"&gt;After Preston gave notice, he received a checklist from his manager that explicitly said: “Do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; wipe or factory reset any Apple owned units (such as laptops, Mac, ipads, and iPhones).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1N0xn"&gt;“Before joining Apple I had a lot of respect for the company,” Preston says. “They’re the one tech company that takes privacy seriously. But then they go and have these policies that are hypocritical and go against their stated values. It’s sort of hard to reconcile. It’s like now that I’m leaving, my privacy isn’t a concern anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6Tj11j"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
