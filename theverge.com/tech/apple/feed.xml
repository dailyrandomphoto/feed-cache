    <title>Brydge’s new keyboard for the M1 iPad makes it more MacBook-like than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLmXH6d9BXFWlQZZxe4MTGLxlcA=/55x0:1045x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165808/BRY_129_MAX_Plus_filler_01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6W9KkO"&gt;Brydge is announcing a keyboard and trackpad accessory for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/21/brydge-unveils-new-max-keyboard-trackpad-combo-for-12-9-inch-ipad-pro/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;the company’s previous accessories&lt;/a&gt;, the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus will let you take your iPad from being a tablet to a laptop, just by connecting it to the accessory. With Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;new M1-powered iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, some might already be thinking about using it to make a MacBook replacement, while others may just be excited for the way you can now neatly attach it via magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qznUJg"&gt;The answer to whether this will help replace your MacBook with an iPad is more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;what it’s always been&lt;/a&gt;: it depends on whether you can do all your work with what’s available on iPadOS. The iPad Pro has been more powerful than a lot of MacBooks for years, but hardware is only part of the equation. While the 12.9-inch iPad Pro may now have a processor as fast as a MacBook’s and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;a better screen&lt;/a&gt; to boot, it’s still using an OS that, for some, won’t be able to fully take advantage of those features. If you’re fine with the limitations of iPadOS, then the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus could be a new solution for taking the iPad into laptop mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AddzH"&gt;The iPad will attach to the new Max Plus magnetically, instead of using the clamp system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;used by previous Brydge keyboards&lt;/a&gt;. That system required you to wedge your expensive tablet between clamps that then held onto that breakable glass — a nerve-wracking and not terribly pleasant experience. This brings Brydge’s offering more in line with the Magic Keyboard, and users will likely appreciate increased ease in switching between laptop and tablet mode. Easy, magnetic attachment is something that’s generally been associated with Apple’s iPad keyboards instead of third-party ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaE9AZ"&gt;While Brydge’s built-in trackpads have generally not compared favorably to Apple’s, the company is hoping to change that by adding native multitouch support. With the Max Plus, Brydge is also playing the size comparison game — its trackpad is the largest on an iPad keyboard, according to the company’s site. That may be a nice bonus if you’re the type of person who likes to use the mouse a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLuQap"&gt;The Brydge 12.9 Max Plus is available for preorder &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-12-9-max-plus%3Fvariant%3D39379780075625&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Brydge’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s expected to ship in June. It comes in three color options (space gray, silver, and white) and costs $249.99 — $100 cheaper than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJQJ3LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11-inch-3rd-generation-and-ipad-air-4th-generation-us-english&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is now letting everyone tweet pictures in 4K on Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VY-VwER3PIt-1bIIRkD8_ZY7cig=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165104/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5PsRbk"&gt;Get ready for Twitter to start looking a whole lot crisper — starting today, the company is letting all users tweet (and view) pictures in 4K on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwChR2"&gt;Twitter’s web app already supports higher-resolution images (at up to 4096 x 4096 resolution), but the mobile apps had been limited to just half that, with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 2048. The company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;previously started testing&lt;/a&gt; the 4K image upload option for mobile users earlier this year, and it seems those tests went well, as its now rolling out the feature to all users starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VlbVFU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter tries to fix problematic image crops by not cropping pictures anymore","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="A4zU7W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Time to Tweet those high res pics –– the option to upload and view 4K images on Android and iOS is now available for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start uploading and viewing images in 4K, update your high-quality image preferences in “Data usage” settings. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XDnWOji3nx"&gt;https://t.co/XDnWOji3nx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1384945690304995330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp7iRF"&gt;In order to enable the new feature, users will have to go to the “data usage” section of the settings menu in the Twitter app and enable both “high-quality images” (for viewing 4K images) and “high-quality image uploads” (for tweeting them). Users can select whether they’d like the higher-resolution images to be enabled for both cellular and Wi-Fi, just Wi-Fi, or disabled entirely — similar options to how Twitter handles higher resolution or auto-playing video. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple now lets you extend a Mac’s AppleCare Plus coverage beyond three years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_ORDh_fFd5xujzyMXk79_D36Co=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164763/vpavic_191118_3800_0201.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RfzyHE"&gt;Apple’s Mac computers typically come with a one-year warranty that you can optionally extend to three years by purchasing AppleCare Plus. The extended warranty also adds coverage for accidents and physical damage. But now, Apple is giving Mac customers the choice to keep AppleCare Plus going for even longer than the usual three-year limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mxt5D7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/applecare-for-mac-extended-coverage/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;As noticed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210580"&gt;a new support page&lt;/a&gt; that confirms people in the United States can convert AppleCare Plus into an indefinite annual subscription once the coverage they paid for upfront lapses. Apple says the recurring annual coverage must be purchased “within 30 days of the end date of your original coverage.” Once you’ve moved to annual billing, it renews automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AL5T5f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More peace of mind for you, more revenue for Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T2Naeg"&gt;AppleCare Plus covers up to two incidents of accidental damage each year. Accident claims require a $99 deductible for a damaged display or external damage. More severe damage (like water incidents) have a deductible of $299. Either way, it’s far cheaper than paying for out-of-warranty repairs or buying a new Mac altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y61QbH"&gt;Presumably this new policy means that Apple will continue to support covered Macs for as long as it has repair parts for a given machine. Part of Apple’s terms and conditions on this says the company will automatically cancel your plan (and provide 60 days’ notice) if it doesn’t have the necessary parts anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaZ4JT"&gt;AppleCare Plus falls under Apple’s services division, so giving customers the option to stretch out their warranties means more peace of mind for them — and more revenue for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Md6NwZ"&gt;Apple’s extended warranty for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch can also be converted into  continued monthly coverage for customers who bought upfront coverage, which normally covers those products for a total of two years. As with the Mac, the renewing coverage must be purchased within 30 days of the original coverage end date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple approved another secret gambling den, masquerading as a puzzle game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRo5vHfFyT2XXx-D65QpbOI_JIw=/113x0:1531x945/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164172/kosta_gambling_den_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xS4HkY"&gt;This morning, I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;how Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching incredibly obvious multimillion-dollar scams&lt;/a&gt; because the company isn’t even bothering to audit its most profitable apps for fraud, and how app developer Kosta Eleftheriou is showing the company how it’s done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Qb4Ts"&gt;But that’s not the only kind of scam Eleftheriou has been uncovering in Apple’s App Store — he has also discovered that Apple’s review teams have been approving games that transform into secret gambling dens when you access them from certain countries (or via VPN). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;We wrote about two of them last Thursday&lt;/a&gt; as if they were an isolated incident, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407589539115011"&gt;he’s now found at least two more&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting this may be a trend — including a match-three puzzle game dubbed &lt;em&gt;Lucky Stars&lt;/em&gt; that turns into a casino if you open it in Russia, and a game called &lt;em&gt;Vegas Pirates&lt;/em&gt; that does the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ch7YAx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; app pretends to be a game for kids 4+, but if you are in Russia (or use a VPN) it becomes an online casino that doesn’t even use Apple’s in-app-purchase system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppleEvent&lt;/a&gt; scam of the day  &lt;a href="https://t.co/VU1XpaiILU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VU1XpaiILU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407589539115011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="5AdBtR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The developer - “Marina Misko” - has several gambling apps, all posing as games for kids 4+  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These have been on the App Store for several months, and even had multiple updates approved by Apple! &lt;a href="https://t.co/iE8pbljeh9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iE8pbljeh9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407629493989378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XeDpim"&gt;In some ways, they’re even more egregious examples: while it might be more shocking that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;a kids’ monkey-collecting-bananas game would transform into a gambling den&lt;/a&gt;, these new apps would seem to invite extra scrutiny with their gambling-oriented visuals and the fact they pretended a Russian news organization was their “developer website.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DkyAQM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The developer’s website listed on the App Store is &lt;a href="https://t.co/mHYeXEn8dV"&gt;https://t.co/mHYeXEn8dV&lt;/a&gt;, a big Russian news outlet. Really.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even the *privacy policy* link they’ve provided to Apple is the same exact link - and Apple has happily accepted all this! &lt;a href="https://t.co/QIgMg78cnf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QIgMg78cnf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407638666989573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RlT9fG"&gt;They’re both gone now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrE0QV"&gt;If you’re looking for shock value, Eleftheriou also spotted this unrelated app the other day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q37FIo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Curated by the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;, for your kids’ safety!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/wFJOc0FeDQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wFJOc0FeDQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384561527387131904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IaTG06"&gt;Apple is testifying before Congress today — and in an incredibly high-profile court case against Epic Games next month — about how its App Store protects users, justifies the company’s traditional 30-percent cut (reportedly $64 billion last year alone), and shouldn’t be broken up. These kinds of discoveries are giving the company’s critics a lot of ammo.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirTags will work with Android... sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in a blue, leather holster, attached to a black bag." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCSMVEWYmDfbODYngQNfZfM47FA=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163879/Apple_airtag_accessories_bag_042021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An AirTag. | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6Gqeg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt; have one feature not mentioned during the announcement yesterday: they’ll work with Android to a limited extent. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/20/lost-airtag-can-be-read-by-any-other-nfc-enabled-iphone-or-android-device/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;support article&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s site that details how AirTags will work with an Android device if you don’t have your iPhone handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k02FLB"&gt;The way AirTags function is by securely communicating with Bluetooth devices and iPhones equipped with ultra-wideband that are in the area. If AirTags exclusively worked with Apple devices it would severely limit their effectiveness, particularly in regions where iPhones aren’t as popular as Android. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A moving image of a phone tapping an AirTag and a link appearing in the notifications on the phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yinUHviyNXw9xFiPoJMZhbSjFrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459713/ios14_iphone12_pro_nfc_notification_animation_crop.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any NFC-equipped phone should be able to just tap the AirTag to get more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9sFmtd"&gt;AirTags won’t work out of the box with an Android device, nor can you use an Android device in lieu of an iPhone with one. Instead, it will only work with Android devices equipped with NFC and only communicate when the AirTags are in Lost Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93EfhH"&gt;First, you’ll need to use your iPhone to activate Lost Mode, which is supposed to show you on a map where your AirTag has wandered off to. Then if someone with an Android device finds your lost AirTag, they can hold it up to their NFC-equipped phone and get details on how to contact you. They’ll only be able to get details if the Lost Mode is activated, which should help with privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZskdY"&gt;The Android support makes AirTags way more useful, but if you want the full experience on an Android device, you’ll probably want to take a gander at Tile’s offerings. The company is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;working on an AirTag competitor&lt;/a&gt; that should work on both iOS and Android. Samsung also has its own AirTag competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Galaxy SmartTags&lt;/a&gt;. Like the AirTags and planned Tile offering, the Galaxy SmartTags use UWB to provide a more exact location for a lost tag. The Galaxy SmartTags only work with Samsung Galaxy phones, but unlike AirTags and the Tile tag, Galaxy SmartTags are available now and start at $29.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big iPad, Mini LED: why Apple’s new iPad Pro display is better and brighter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/84SmiG_awBbaB7etdE6k2AxvGSg=/0x0:1668x1112/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163536/ipadprocrop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6EkwEH"&gt;Apple’s latest iPad Pro might look very similar to the model it’s replacing, but it contains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;several major upgrades on the inside&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got the same powerful, energy-efficient M1 chip as the latest MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and now the redesigned iMac. Cellular models have made the jump to 5G. The front-facing camera can zoom and pan to keep you in focus on video calls. But aside from the processor, the biggest technical leap is exclusive to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro: it’s what Apple calls the “Liquid Retina XDR,” a new display that adopts Mini LED backlighting to achieve higher brightness and greater contrast than any iPad (or Mac) that the company has ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNYMdt"&gt;Apple says the 12.9-inch iPad Pro can reach 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness — on par with the ultra-expensive Pro Display XDR — and portions of the screen can hit an eye-searing 1,600 nits when playing HDR content. That’s brighter than many 4K HDR TVs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLF1Xe"&gt;For comparison’s sake, the previous iPad Pro topped out at 600 nits. Full stop. These measurements also obliterate Apple’s Mac lineup. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can go up to 500 nits. The flashy 24-inch iMac introduced yesterday? Also 500 nits. Things move a little closer when you look at the iPhone 12 Pro’s OLED screen, which can hit a max brightness of 800 nits and 1,200 in HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbvOqZ"&gt;But Apple isn’t yet ready to make the switch to OLED for its tablets, and the reasoning probably comes down to the brightness advantage of Mini LED — plus the company’s promise that this iPad Pro, with its fancy display, still has the standard 10-hour battery life that iPad users have come to expect. Either way, this is an upgrade that should be plainly evident to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="20XTTP"&gt;What is Mini LED?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FRsI6s"&gt;Unlike OLED, where individual pixels are self-illuminating and can fully turn off when not needed, Mini LED is more of a natural progression from the LCD screens that have become such a mainstay of consumer electronics. But where this new approach differentiates itself is in the size and quantity of LEDs behind the screen. During its Spring Loaded event, Apple’s Heidi Delgado said that the previous iPad Pro had 72 LEDs, but the new “Liquid Retina XDR” manages to pack in over 10,000 of them. Apple accomplished this by miniaturizing the LEDs to a size “120 times smaller in volume than the previous design.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TynE4-W6Ht5SEGThE4vS914xSVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459379/MiniLED.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says the 12.9-inch iPad Pro has over 10,000 LEDs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9enWaW"&gt;The Mini LEDs are grouped into over 2,500 local dimming zones that can individually brighten and dim based on whatever’s being shown on the display. This granular level of control, according to Delgado, results in customers “seeing the brightest highlights along with subtle details in the darkest parts of an image.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UY5ocq8wXmPsr70iTw_OQ_biAp4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459369/Zones.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dimming zones can light up and dim based on what’s on-screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lcvwE6"&gt;Apple isn’t first to Mini LED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BW7aSj"&gt;Though this might be the first time Mini LED has found its way into a tablet, the technology has already appeared in TVs. &lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/blog/article/mini-led-technology"&gt;TCL really sparked the trend&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and apparently Samsung and LG took notice: their higher-end 2021 LCD TVs now utilize Mini LED backlighting as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1aYqdAc47IEWfHdrjCihYfXLEjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459345/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_9.36.17_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A visualization of TCL’s Mini LED implementation on its TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FOPASo"&gt;Here’s how TCL explains the visual improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JlVqsN"&gt;LED LCD TVs have two parts of the display that combine together to create an image. The “LCD” (liquid crystal display) part of the display creates a picture and the “LED” (light-emitting diode) part of the display makes light that shines through the picture so your eyes can see it. So the benefit of thousands of precisely controlled mini-LEDs in an active matrix backlight is more powerful light that is more smoothly distributed across the screen, more precisely controlled for sharp contrast and more effective in creating vividly saturated colors that dazzle the eye. Mini-LED simply delivers dramatically better picture performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iOxYD4"&gt;The huge uptick in LEDs could also result in improved panel uniformity; some owners of the previous 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uneven-backlight-on-11-ipad-pro.2154729/"&gt;have observed uneven backlighting&lt;/a&gt;. Having exchanged one or two for this very reason, I can vouch. The “panel lottery” is a thing with pretty much any device — TVs, laptops, tablets, etc. — but making the move to Mini LED should help with consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zn1jun"&gt;What’s this I hear about MicroLED?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ebps60"&gt;MicroLED is seen as the next major leap in TV display technology and the potential successor to OLED. It shares many of OLED’s best traits (like self-emissive LEDs), ups the brightness, and comes without most of the associated drawbacks since the technology is inorganic. But right now, MicroLED is extremely cost prohibitive and really only found in ultra-premium luxury TVs from Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4I43B"&gt;Final impressions on the new iPad Pro will need to wait until we get it in our hands. But as someone who uses the previous 12.9-inch model daily for productive and creative purposes, I’m very curious to see what Mini LED adds to the iPad experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirTags don’t have a built-in keychain loop, and we have some thoughts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsh9JcBTVaabDsfJuV2nAvrMoWk=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69162411/airtagaccessories.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CwaDy4"&gt;Apple’s new AirTag trackers are finally here after years of rumors. The $29 trackers work with Apple’s Find My network, utilizing both Bluetooth and UWB technology to help owners track anything from their keys to their bags. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzvFVZ"&gt;But the design of the new trackers is somewhat controversial: unlike most Bluetooth trackers, Apple’s iteration doesn’t include a built-in key ring loop. The subsequent debate has shattered the tranquility of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s newsroom over whether Apple’s somewhat Spartan design is brilliant or bogus. Well, at least between two of the most genteel &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers, Jon Porter and Chaim Gartenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/492kammhY61DFUGcSC-yVmeGOFs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458151/keychain.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artist’s rendering of an AirTag design featuring a keychain hole punch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qh75iy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon Porter, reporter&lt;/strong&gt;: Debate me, coward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KMiTJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim Gartenberg, news editor&lt;/strong&gt;: Gladly! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvGf9T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt;: Let’s start with a point that we’ll definitely both agree on: it’s a relief to see the AirTags’ battery is user-replaceable. It sounds like such a basic point, but considering Apple’s track record with its AirPods, Magic Mouse, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook line, Magic Keyboard — wait does anything else Apple makes have replaceable batteries? — it wasn’t a guarantee. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20901686/tile-tracker-mate-pro-slim-sticker-release-date-news-features"&gt;Tile’s keychain-focused Mate and Pro trackers&lt;/a&gt; have removable batteries, but its Sticker (which has a very similar form factor to the AirTag) doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HWw9NV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Brilliant or bogus?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOebJ1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: I will grant you that easily accessible, user-replaceable batteries are always a good thing. And on a whole, the overall aesthetics of the AirTags are nice, with a two-tone shiny white plastic / chrome back that’s vaguely reminiscent of the old iPods to me. But the overly sleek Apple design highlights the biggest issue I have here: there’s no built-in loop or hole to attach a key ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8Ur5Y"&gt;The AirTag is a product that’s designed to track your keys, and yet it offers no way to actually attach itself to those keys out of the box, something that’s practically table stakes from Tile, Chipolo, and virtually every other Bluetooth tracker from the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKNaTC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt;: I hear you, but I think Apple’s approach is better. It means it can sell just one version of the AirTag to track whatever item you want, rather than selling different devices whether you want to track your keys, or your bike, or your jacket. Just buy an AirTag and buy whatever accessory you need to attach it. And for what it’s worth, I really like the design of the little holder accessory they’re selling to attach the AirTag to a set of keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhwlMC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: That little &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHJ23ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-leather-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D6a69955a8a6ddce99e189acb007fb66a7a8f18e4729ee64e7b785b8e88b5246abab8110b9e5c815b2e8e74d5f263e66b2a7a391fb4c93d7f7a32238c65c707863e916aaeeebaa11b59a86351ea8281e57db77af4fcc7609d12ec0601e21a15603b9023598629f037ffbe58f82b035223&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22394644%2Fapple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory costs $35&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;em&gt;more than an entire AirTag&lt;/em&gt;. Even Apple’s cheapest AirTag case, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK0W3ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-loop%3Ffnode%3D6a69955a8a6ddce99e189acb007fb66a7a8f18e4729ee64e7b785b8e88b5246abab8110b9e5c815b2e8e74d5f263e66b2a7a391fb4c93d7f7a32238c65c707863e916aaeeebaa11b59a86351ea8281e57db77af4fcc7609d12ec0601e21a15603b9023598629f037ffbe58f82b035223&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22394644%2Fapple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $30 plastic loop&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn’t look like it’ll even be useful for attaching to keys. This is just Apple’s typical accessory tax, forced onto customers because of an intentional choice of aesthetic form over useful function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNKKxo"&gt;And don’t get me started on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX862AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-bag-charm%3Ffnode%3D6a69955a8a6ddce99e189acb007fb66a7a8f18e4729ee64e7b785b8e88b5246abab8110b9e5c815b2e8e74d5f263e66b2a7a391fb4c93d7f7a32238c65c707863e916aaeeebaa11b59a86351ea8281e57db77af4fcc7609d12ec0601e21a15603b9023598629f037ffbe58f82b035223&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22394644%2Fapple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hermès accessories&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VOt7rznNzumaSTrrkX8AFrjBc6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458169/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_5.57.30_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nmRXJl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay fine, I’m not going to argue that the $349 Hermès key ring isn’t incredibly stupid, and it would be nice if the leather key ring actually included an AirTag at that price. The setup is too expensive, period, and hopefully third-party accessory manufacturers will step in to fill the demand for cheap keychain holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="girWDS"&gt;But more importantly, I think separating the tech bit from the holder bit makes sense for an accessory that’s going to have to withstand so much abuse on a daily basis. Keys can be sharp, and they beat up anything that shares a pocket with them, so I’d prefer it if that thing that gets beaten up is a holder rather than the core piece of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t773Ho"&gt;Look at a Tile key fob tracker that’s been used for a couple of years, and it looks grimy as hell. I wouldn’t be surprised if some people end up replacing the whole device when the battery runs out, just so they can get a shiny new tracker. But when your AirTag keychain inevitably starts looking worse for wear, you just replace the holder rather than the tracker itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Co3luD8e5pkvGFCzcC1RfxhbWE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457308/yJBAy1w.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hywvlC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: These are all valid points, but you’re ignoring the fact that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fairtag&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22394644%2Fapple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;these accessories and protective cases&lt;/a&gt; could all exist in &lt;em&gt;addition&lt;/em&gt; to including a cutout to directly attach a key ring. There’s already a similar cottage industry of accessories for Tile’s trackers for those who want them, and with the marketing power of Apple behind it, there’s no reason to think that AirTags wouldn’t have eclipsed that level of interest from accessory makers, even if it did have a cutout for a key ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NM8Yi5"&gt;It’s not that cases are bad — Apple’s leather option does look great and is almost definitely a more robust option than my hypothetical cutout. But it’d be nice to give customers the choice, instead of just forcing them into an option that requires spending more money right from the start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D24Qfh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394331/apple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PwfbZF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt;: At a certain point, though, you’re running up against physical limitations, and Apple has to pick its battles. I’m already seeing some of our esteemed colleagues in Slack complaining about how thick these trackers are, which I’d wager is because Apple prioritized building in a removable battery. Adding a loop with enough space for a key chain to go through adds yet more bulk. You have to draw the line somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSBjAD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: Fair enough. So, Jon, are you buying an AirTag tracker? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naEYZZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt;: Honestly, I’m going to wait to see how the third-party accessories work out. If I can get a half-decent leather keychain holder for the equivalent of $20 or so, then I think it makes a lot of sense spending $50 all-in with the tracker itself. Yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pfzgre"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: I might buy one to stick in my luggage at some point, but I generally don’t lose my keys enough to need to invest in a tracker for them (famous last words, potentially). Especially not at the $65 price tag that Apple is asking for a full key ring setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYatkG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMETVs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oYWndI"&gt;Apple has announced the next generation of its iPad Pro line. But most of the biggest changes for Apple’s flagship tablet are largely on the inside. The latest iPad Pros feature a new eight-core M1 processor; the same chip featured in the most recent model refreshes for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;newly announced iMac&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIw2yY"&gt;Like last year, the iPad Pro comes in two sizes: 11 inches and 12.9 inches. The 12.9-inch model this year also includes a new Mini-LED screen, which Apple is branding as a “Liquid Retina XDR” display. The iPad Pro 2021 refreshes also include support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB 4, in addition to 5G connectivity. Both iPad Pros also feature a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that can automatically track you during video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7V3r5T"&gt;Of course, specs don’t always tell how much has changed between model refreshes. And it can be easy to presume, at first glance, that not much has changed — especially if you own a 2020 iPad Pro. If you want to see how both iPad Pro models with the M1 chip compare to the other three iPads Apple currently sells, along with the 2020 Pro models, take a look at the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Any video conferencing app can use the iPad Pro’s fancy zoom and pan camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WzipxLaS7ueC_Y9xzx7EXXkc9IQ=/0x26:600x426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161443/Center_stage_ipad.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Pro’s front-facing camera can digitally pan and tilt to track video conference participants.&lt;/em&gt; | Video: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mFm6sw"&gt;Apple has confirmed that the digital pan and zoom feature of the new M1 iPad Pro’s front-facing camera can work with any video conferencing app, not just FaceTime. That opens the door for popular apps like Zoom and Microsoft Teams to make remote work and e-learning blend more seamlessly into the realities of pandemic life — a hybrid lifestyle that’s likely to continue even after the outbreak subsides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHdkaS"&gt;Center Stage, as Apple brands it, keeps video conferencing participants properly framed even as they move about a room by combining machine learning with a fixed 12-megapixel sensor touting an ultra-wide 122‑degree field of view. We’ve seen similar tracking on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871173/facebook-portal-camera-price-release-date-availability"&gt;Portal TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;, and even the Xbox Kinect accessory. But those are niche devices compared to the iPad, which saw sales surge last year as students and remote workers snapped the tablets up in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDTFsN"&gt;“Center Stage works with FaceTime and other video conferencing apps,” says Apple on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395325%2Fipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro landing page&lt;/a&gt;. Apple missed its chance to scale FaceTime to compete with the likes of Zoom and Teams by reneging on its promise to make it an industry standard in favor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;ecosytem lock-in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m2tpdGV2oDI6nPCbtkc4DhWyros=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459122/lcimg_b1916176_0880_4bb5_9b1c_bfaee6cd2f4d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultra-wide front-facing camera is still located at the “top” of the new iPad Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UQG24u"&gt;Apple demonstrated Center Stage with two participants, both of whom are recognized and framed appropriately as they move about a kitchen, on a FaceTime call with a third. It’s a good demo; the COVID-19 pandemic has blended work and life so hard that it’s now fairly common to see people making dinner during a Zoom meeting across international time zones, or a kid asking for a parent’s help during a Teams school lesson. Tech like Center Stage can help further infuse this sense of humanity into our otherwise stoic professional and educational pursuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuwYuF"&gt;Unfortunately, the position of the front-facing camera, unchanged on the new M1 iPad Pro, makes participants appear to be staring off to the side when used with a keyboard dock, as is common for business and school uses. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;iPadOS creates other frustrations&lt;/a&gt; for video conferences. Hopefully the iPad Pro is just a start and we’ll see ultra-wide Center Stage cameras coming to the much maligned, but better positioned, MacBook webcams soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching the most egregious scams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RiP7jjgMFJRfUbjrdRBS5eHQf_Y=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161392/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A one-man Bunco Squad is poking holes in Apple’s App Store image&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qQn2RS"&gt;Recently, I reached out to the most profitable company in the world to ask a series of basic questions. I wanted to understand: how is a single man making the entire Apple App Store review team look silly? Particularly now that Apple’s in the fight of its life, both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;in the courts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378697/apple-witness-senate-judiciary-hearing-antitrust-app-stores"&gt;in Congress later today&lt;/a&gt;, to prove its App Store is a well-run system that keeps users safe instead of a monopoly that needs to be broken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnxRWd"&gt;That man’s name is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou"&gt;Kosta Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt;, and over the past few months, he’s made a convincing case that Apple is either uninterested or incompetent at stopping multimillion-dollar scams in its own App Store. He’s repeatedly found scam apps that prey on ordinary iPhone and iPad owners by luring them into a “free trial” of an app with seemingly thousands of fake 5-star reviews, only to charge them outrageous sums of money for a recurring subscription that many don’t understand how to cancel. “It’s a situation that most communities are blind to because of how Apple is essentially brainwashing people into believing the App Store is a trusted place,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOIPmq"&gt;There’s a lot to unpack there: fake free trials, fake reviews, subscription awareness. We could write an entire story about each. Today, I’d like to focus on how one guy could find what Apple’s $64-billion-a-year App Store apparently cannot, because the answer is remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lYDL7A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Can it really be this easy?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zwzUSt"&gt;You simply look at the apps that are making the most money. Then, you find ones where the user reviews are suspicious and look for ridiculously high subscription prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHzVUl"&gt;That’s it. There’s no step four. Eleftheriou tells us this is how he started finding these scams, but you don’t need to be a coder to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJ0ZZh"&gt;Heck, let’s try it together right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mT5Gf8"&gt;While Apple doesn’t share “top grossing” charts for the App Store any more (that seems to have died with the introduction of iOS 11 in 2017), companies like SensorTower still publicly share that data. All you have to do is pick an app category — &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/rankings/top/iphone/us/business?date=2021-04-15"&gt;say, Business&lt;/a&gt; — and click through the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5ukZd"&gt;Here’s “&lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/us/appitate-llc/app/call-recorder-icall/1447098963/overview"&gt;Call Recorder iCall&lt;/a&gt;,” the #26 top-grossing app in the Business category on the day I checked. As you can see below, “Charlier Brown” says he’s 100 percent satisfied and there’s a 3-day free trial, so what do we have to lose other than... &lt;em&gt;$9.99 a week?&lt;/em&gt; Hooo boy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rESiNvMmQvBR9xF-Tv31PWBlrz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453912/icall_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Charlier Brown” thinks you’ll like this call recorder app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pdxBfX"&gt;Users of the app tend to complain they can’t figure out how to cancel that $520 a year  subscription — and that the app often stops recording after just a handful of seconds. Yet somehow it’s got a 4.5-star rating on the App Store. And fake reviews clearly have something to do with it. Here are a few &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/US/publisher/app/appName/1447098963/review-history?selected_tab=reviews"&gt;that app data firm SensorTower recently archived&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BVUdpL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No real downside&lt;/strong&gt; by Leena Hayes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2E8hgU"&gt;The app is free and is very versatile. Obviously if you are more into working out it may not be the best (there are high lv’s so it can be difficult) but for what it offers you it’s fantastic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89XJAI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best at home at I’ve found&lt;/strong&gt; by Darren Gorham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezVce8"&gt;Ive tried various at home apps to use in between the gym and none of them are as easy to use. The workouts are effective and I love the tracking it provides along with caloric counts and timing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xM0gc5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No equipment needed&lt;/strong&gt; by Rosalba Noble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J70tk8"&gt;If you want to feel better about yourself &amp;amp; not join a gym, highly recommend this app as it gets you motivated to bigger as in more reps - not weights. I think its great to use your own body weight to get that burning workout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nnHDKv"&gt;Call Recorder iCall is clearly not an exercise app, but that doesn’t seem to have stopped these “reviewers” from trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xw0eN9"&gt;Now, let’s try the #8 top-grossing app in the Utilities category: “&lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/us/tv-cast-co-ltd/app/roku-remote-control-roki/1481938145/"&gt;Roku Remote Control - Roki&lt;/a&gt;,” which seems a little suspicious when you consider that Roku gives away &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roku-official-remote-control/id482066631"&gt;its own official remote control app&lt;/a&gt; for free. Here are a few choice one-star reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RxbZZW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking my money&lt;/strong&gt; by 804user&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdhrE0"&gt;I paid for the $19.99, but I am still being charged each month and still have yet to hear back from any type of customer SERVICE....BEWARE!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7qpoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Didn’t work&lt;/strong&gt; by lawstudent1989&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHtwze"&gt;And now I can’t cancel my subscription in the app it and I’m worried it’s just a farce to get my credit card info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9bAAE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not impressed&lt;/strong&gt; by FallenWish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVIzy7"&gt;So originally I had this app on my android and it was free but now we have to pay for it?Like we don’t already dole out 300 dollars or more for the tvs   ‍♀️There is just no winning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="f0PrJV"&gt;And here’s the first screen you’ll see after downloading:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fndrSL7Q0saqUf7aNYqGgnEJFM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453914/roki_subscription.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Roku remote looks like such a good deal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TMkewI"&gt;How could an app like this possibly have a 4.5-star rating in the App Store? Well, it wouldn’t if you actually averaged out each written review: Apple’s “4.5” counts every disembodied rating where someone punched in a number of stars, even if that was just to dismiss an annoying pop-up so they could try the app. As Eleftheriou tells me (pointing to his tweet, which I’ve embedded below), Roki would have had a rating of just 1.7 stars if you only counted reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yJSncF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Out of 15,000 ratings, only 338 reviews! And their average?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.7 stars&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ONE. POINT. SEVEN.&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1360146173340704775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14eOzT"&gt;Here’s the kicker: Eleftheriou called out this app’s behavior &lt;em&gt;two months ago&lt;/em&gt;, and yet &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1481938145?l=en"&gt;it still exists in the App Store today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear why, but it brings me to another important point. Even when people point out these shady apps, Apple doesn’t necessarily take action — and as Eleftheriou pointed out to me during our conversation, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has some direct experience there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3URwfR"&gt;On February 8th, we brought a bunch of these scams to Apple’s attention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;with this story&lt;/a&gt;, which prominently embedded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938981866860550"&gt;a tweet by Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; about another scammy app called “&lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/US/dragon-game-studio/app/star-gazer/1474038335/overview"&gt;Star Gazer+&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4j60ea"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;4.6 stars, with over 80,000 ratings, and a glowing 5-star "featured" review: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Aup1ehYTdk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Aup1ehYTdk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938981866860550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qCB7ma"&gt;Apple didn’t remove that app for two whole months, and won’t tell us the reasons for the delay. On the record, Apple would only provide this statement for our story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y6rze1"&gt;“We designed and built the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for our users, and are constantly improving our processes to reduce fraud, malware and spam. To provide our users with the best experience, we regularly reject and remove apps, as well as fraudulent ratings and reviews, resulting in millions of removals every year. We intend to keep at this important work to ensure users can confidently download the apps they love and developers continue to make the App Store a great business opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jxbpnQ"&gt;Star Gazer+ finally disappeared on April 8th, after Apple was approached by another journalist &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2021/04/07/apple-iphone-ipad-app-store-scam-warning-new-iphone-problem/?sh=7231e8a960aa"&gt;who publicly asked why it was taking so long&lt;/a&gt;. (It also happened to be the day Epic Games drew attention to some of these scams in a legal filing, though we’re not sure either is the true reason.) And while it appears that its publisher Dragon Game Studio has been booted off the App Store in the process, Apple appears to have overlooked its &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; publisher account &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/publisher/publisher/631073615"&gt;for co-founder Jonas Johnsson&lt;/a&gt;, whose current claim to fame — no joke — is a “Ghost Detector+” with a $5/week recurring subscription fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qam2H9"&gt;Johnsson’s also got &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/horoscope/id1273077875"&gt;an $8/week horoscope app&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m sorry, this juxtaposition of angry reviews and a 4.5 score makes me laugh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YALilJ9VUTMVQajkcbSkuvP9qKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453915/Clipboard01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seems like a bit of a mismatch here, Apple?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wVq2ga"&gt;While it’s impossible for us to tell how many of the horoscope app’s 32,000 star-only ratings are fake, Eleftheriou says Apple should have no problem with that. “When you consider refund request rates, app usage, and other associated info that only Apple has, you could imagine a totally revamped discovery system that does away with the current crude star-rating system that hasn’t seen any innovation since Bezos pioneered it 20 years ago,” he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99ZpZ8"&gt;During my hunt for scam apps, I also notice that some reviewers of these shady apps complain that developers are asking them for money a second time, even though they already purchased full premium access, and Eleftheriou says it sadly appears to be a theme: “A lot of scammers go and buy successful apps from people, and all they need to do is take that skeleton, make minor modifications and make a lot of money,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu8vQN"&gt;To get a sense of just how much money these scams are bilking out of people, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263766331494402"&gt;here are some comparisons&lt;/a&gt; Eleftheriou made when he spotted a VPN app scam last week, one that Apple was remarkably quick to shut down (after myself and a number of other journalists reached out to Apple about the painfully obvious scam):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GOSyil"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To give you an idea, that’s more recurring revenue than apps like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Microsoft Word&lt;br&gt;- Microsoft OneDrive&lt;br&gt;- Google Drive&lt;br&gt;- Washington Post&lt;br&gt;- Fox News&lt;br&gt;- Reddit&lt;br&gt;- Bloomberg&lt;br&gt;- NBC Sports&lt;br&gt;- Grand Theft Auto&lt;br&gt;- NBA LIVE&lt;br&gt;- Monopoly&lt;br&gt;- DocuSign&lt;br&gt;- Udemy&lt;br&gt;- LastPass&lt;br&gt;- GoPro&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263766331494402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSbuHf"&gt;But it’s only “quick” if you ignore that Apple didn’t stop the scammers for six whole months, even though they caught the &lt;em&gt;exact same developer&lt;/em&gt; doing the &lt;em&gt;exact same thing &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263777865846787"&gt;months before&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="237PTA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It gets worse. This developer is a repeat offender inside Apple’s “walled garden”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They had *another* VPN scam that netted them over half a MILLION dollars before it was shutdown early 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now knowing Apple’s lack of punishment they’re even more brazen &amp;amp; more profitable. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R99l9Rn21u"&gt;pic.twitter.com/R99l9Rn21u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263777865846787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VznQX9"&gt;You would think Apple would keep these off the App Store, right? And if not then it would at least root them out, catch the scam artists, and keep them from doing it again. Yet that doesn’t seem to be happening. While Apple currently makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;an estimated $64 billion a year from its App Store&lt;/a&gt; and tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it has computer automation, proprietary review tools, huge volumes of internal data, and a dedicated “Discovery Fraud team” of humans at its disposal, a single person on a laptop in his living room is finding egregious scams that Apple continues to host, and I was able to use his basic technique to do the same thing. As Apple faces down hearings in Congress and lawsuits in court, its argument that it needs to maintain total control over the iPhone app ecosystem to keep users safe doesn’t mesh with the obvious examples of grift that anyone can easily find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxDzim"&gt;Here’s another scam Eleftheriou spotted (I highly recommend this whole thread):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="75urnh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You think the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; is “a place you can trust”?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Think again! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to spot a $5M/year scam, in 5 minutes flat: &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1381463196280610816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6rk0YT"&gt;And another:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cdx7sV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I don't know what's worse about this app:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- “Translated” fake reviews&lt;br&gt;- “Recommended by Apple” popups in Safari&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kq5lRrKCWc"&gt;https://t.co/Kq5lRrKCWc&lt;/a&gt; contact email&lt;br&gt;- Blank website, registered in India&lt;br&gt;- $9.99/week subscription&lt;br&gt;- Grossing $1M (!) a month&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is Apple even doing?? &lt;a href="https://t.co/5oUBCJ2GNh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5oUBCJ2GNh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1379682377304211457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s8pjCr"&gt;And another. (If you find some, too, Eleftheriou would love to hear from you at bunco.squad@hey.com.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zAHGv8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So once again, Apple took down another app I exposed but is cool with the developer running their other, even *more* profitable scam. I'm speechless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below you see "Live Wallpaper Z", allowed to keep stealing $40k/month from unsuspecting people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do I know?  &lt;a href="https://t.co/KkehMixic8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KkehMixic8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357446762949054464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ubGJ3M"&gt;Eleftheriou tells me that Apple has removed over 100 apps due to his reports — and if you’re wondering whether his online crusade is personal, the answer is most definitely yes. He began digging for scams after his own app FlickType, a keyboard for Apple Watch, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011082075148291"&gt;was overtaken by scam apps that didn’t work and charged ludicrous fees&lt;/a&gt;, yet prospered due to fake reviews. What’s more, he claims Apple gave his competitors (and scammers) a leg up by refusing to initially approve his app — because Apple was hoping to acquire it from him at a cheap price instead. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he filed a lawsuit against Apple&lt;/a&gt; for two years of lost revenue and other damages. So he’s absolutely got skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdQ4IV"&gt;But I don’t think that lessens the impact of his Twitter threads about where, precisely, Apple’s App Store is falling down on the job. The fake review situation seems bad. So do the difficult-to-cancel recurring subscriptions. While I like to think most &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers will see the fine print and know how to cancel, and Apple’s been getting better about mandated warnings, the bewildered reviews on these apps are a sign that many iPhone and iPad users are still having trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mhph4"&gt;Eleftheriou suggests to me that the kind of users who might be most vulnerable to these scams are experiencing a kind of perfect storm: “They get virus pop-ups in Safari, they’re directed to the App Store and think the app is recommended by Apple, they download the app thinking it’ll help them, it’s got the perfect ratings, and they’re not savvy enough to know.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cs9uOD"&gt;He shares a chart with me (from &lt;a href="https://appfigures.com/"&gt;AppFigures&lt;/a&gt;, see below) about how long it can take for vulnerable users to turn off recurring subscriptions: “Only half will have figured out how to cancel it two months later. The other half still hasn’t figured it out after 8 whole weekly billing cycles,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3JMtrtvtCzjrtE4NikKBOpM4qo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22454671/QTKjQiuW.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chart by AppFigures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;“Only half will have figured out how to cancel it two months later.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JYCDB0"&gt;Situations like these make it harder than ever for Apple to justify its constant rhetoric about how the App Store is safe, secure, and defended, or that it’s necessary for Apple to be solely in charge, something that has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647249/wwdc-apple-parental-control-app-store-mdm-spotify-moderation-developers-2019"&gt;already been in question&lt;/a&gt; for years due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;the company’s arbitrary enforcement of its rules&lt;/a&gt; and recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;App Store cash grabs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tQevDt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7HZ4dh"&gt;And we’re starting to hear from Apple insiders, too, that the company’s claims about App Store security are overblown. Eric Friedman, the head of the company’s Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk (FEAR) team, will be testifying in next month’s Epic Games trial. In a recent deposition he spoke of the App Review team as “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight” and “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog.” His team reportedly believed App Review’s job was incentivized to get apps “through the pipe” and “move people through” like TSA employees. “App Reviewers typically review between 50 to 100 apps per day,” reads part of Epic Games’ filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61G2Bb"&gt;Other App Store executives deposed for the Epic Games trial admitted that they were aware of a number of the types of scams we’re discussing today, including ringtone apps that reportedly raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars a month despite users warning against them — &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf"&gt;start at page 170 here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; for examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pv1LNy"&gt;“Apple likes to tie the App Store together with the system level protections, and bundle them together as the reason why the distribution is secure, but really it’s the system-level protections that are doing all the work,” says Eleftheriou. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slU8nz"&gt;Meanwhile, Apple former senior director of worldwide marketing (and noted tech analyst) Michael Gartenberg praised Eleftheriou’s recent efforts to highlight scams, suggesting that the Apple ecosystem is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gartenberg/status/1383122033588985856"&gt;“breaking at the seams.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="owr4Jb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I believe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@keleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; has brought an important issue about the App Store to a mainstream audience. I hope Apple gets its act together soon. The ecosystem that is often praised is breaking at the seams IMHO&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Gartenberg (@Gartenberg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gartenberg/status/1383122033588985856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gloOn0"&gt;But the thing I’m stuck on is how the most profitable company in the world, a company that has long justified a 30-percent cut of the App Store’s billions because of its App Review efforts, a company with multiple enforcement teams and access to internal data, isn’t doing the simple task of auditing the App Store’s top-grossing apps for fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGV82N"&gt;It’s not a novel idea: &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/12/03/barnard-game-app-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;’s John Gruber suggested it in December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and again &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1169078580703375361"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and again &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/09/widgetsmith_bunco_squad"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="WF8q98"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They don’t have to look through them all. Even if that were possible it’d be stupid. All they have to do is police the most popular ones. If they simply looked at the top charts and scanned for scams they’d find most of them.&lt;/p&gt;— John Gruber (@gruber) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1310634858499190792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mRxkda"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapp-store%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22385859%2Fapple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;though Apple claims&lt;/a&gt; “the apps we offer are held to the highest standards for privacy, security, and content,” and that “moderators review worldwide App Store charts for quality and accuracy” every single day, it doesn’t seem to have taken this simple step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMLMpL"&gt;Apple would not tell me why one man is continuing to find egregious apps that Apple’s fraud and app review teams are missing, or whether it goes back to inspect the App Store’s most lucrative apps for fraud. The company would not say how it protects customers against fake reviews, or whether any customers that fell for these scams will get refunds, or how it plans to combat scams in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGefny"&gt;Apple did say generically that it does offer &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084"&gt;the ability to &lt;em&gt;request&lt;/em&gt; refunds&lt;/a&gt;; that it does re-review apps against its App Store guidelines; and that it has improved its subscription processes both by 1) requiring app developers to clearly display what customers are getting into and how to cancel, and 2) prompting users to “manage” their subscription at the time they delete an app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2NWfIg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I repeat my request from last year: the App Store needs a bunco squad — a team that hunts for and is empowered to take action against scammy apps. And ban repeat offenders. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nGpZeALUdw"&gt;https://t.co/nGpZeALUdw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Gruber (@gruber) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1169078580703375361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 4, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYUNiw"&gt;By the way: you know that app that John Gruber helped draw attention to in 2019, the one that reportedly charged $10 every week for wallpaper you could find free online? &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/background-beautiful-photos/id1171036231"&gt;It’s still on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Never got removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Rh0Nwo"&gt;It currently has a 4.1 rating, despite countless negative reviews, and &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/US/tron-apps-inc/app/background-beautiful-photos/1171036231/overview"&gt;SensorTower estimates&lt;/a&gt; the app still makes its developer $10,000 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
