    <title>Apple announces new $1 billion North Carolina campus and $80 billion additional US spending</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HctfLO"&gt;Apple has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403407%2Fapple-us-spending-new-north-carolina-campus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new spending plans&lt;/a&gt; for the US, including the establishment of a 3,000-employee “campus and engineering hub” in North Carolina and the commitment of an additional $80 billion in investment across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVTPiv"&gt;Back in 2018, the firm said it would spend more than $350 billion in the US over the next five years, but today, it announced it is increasing that figure by 20 percent to $430 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuMnJs"&gt;“At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to US innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBGFeQ"&gt;And why not? Like many big tech firms, Apple has done &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/technology/tech-company-earnings-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html"&gt;very well during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, when other industries have suffered and investors have sought safe places for their money. The company likes to spin these investment announcements as a sort of largesse, but they are, of course, par for the course for a hugely successful and ambitious firm like Apple. As today’s press release notes, the $80 billion will go toward “direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the US, and other domestic spend — including dozens of Apple TV+ productions across 20 states.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tA4QfA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple will invest in basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and broadband&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rn2Ug4"&gt;The new campus in North Carolina is noteworthy and part of an ongoing trend among tech firms to look outside their traditional California homes. Google is currently &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/google-to-invest-1-billion-in-new-campus-in-new-york-city.html"&gt;investing&lt;/a&gt; $1 billion in a New York City campus; Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262149/amazon-helix-arlington-virginia-design-hq2-campus"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; its second HQ in Virginia; and Oracle &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+move+headquarters&amp;amp;oq=oracle+move+headquarters&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2768j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last year it’s moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03fjHs"&gt;Apple’s North Carolina campus will be part of the state’s Research Triangle (named after the trio of nearby universities: Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The company will invest more than $1 billion in the area and pledges to create at least 3,000 new jobs in “machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and other cutting-edge fields.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HlVqX"&gt;Notably, Apple also says it will establish a $100 million fund to support “schools and communities” in North Carolina and will contribute more than $110 million to 80 of the state’s poorest counties to help fund critical infrastructure like “broadband, roads and bridges, and public schools.” The Biden administration has made such infrastructure spending a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/economy/biden-infrastructure-plan.html"&gt;critical part&lt;/a&gt; of its plans for the US, but it seems that when government lags behind, private firms will step in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvD22z"&gt;You can read Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403407%2Fapple-us-spending-new-north-carolina-campus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full press release&lt;/a&gt; for further details, including the companies expanding hiring in its teams in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, and Iowa, and its investments in new clean energy projects in the US and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Ted Lasso, Fathom, Annette, The Conjuring, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKrsNUueXMk8mDl_JgMmWfWsFYw=/459x0:4679x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69184273/1310834710.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ted Lasso returns | Photo by SAGAwards2021 via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CmCS8F"&gt;The Oscars are tonight and despite my best efforts I still haven’t seen all the Best Picture contenders, so will hold off on making predictions (but honestly not sure how anyone beats Chadwick Boseman as Best Actor). Lots of good trailers this week including the return of the most wholesome show on all of streaming and the next big Marvel movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GzBVA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ldLYIo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/auxeLrtk7tk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3Q4Mqy"&gt;Ted Lasso Season 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="l1kA0H"&gt;You know when you really love a show and it gets popular and everyone else likes it... and you brace for its sophomore season to be not quite as good as its debut? I am hopeful that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; will not fall into this pattern, and the trailer for season two looks extremely promising (Ted: “Back home if a team was playing poorly, we don’t call them unlucky, what do we call ‘em, Coach?” Beard: “New York Jets.”) Jason Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt, Hannah Waddingham, and Juno Temple return along with others from season one for &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which drops on Apple TV Plus July 23rd. And if you’re interested in a little bonus Ted Lasso content, developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22401368/ted-lasso-shortbread-recipe-apple-spring-loaded"&gt;David Smith managed to figure out the recipe&lt;/a&gt; for the shortbread cookies Ted makes for Hannah. So wholesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOyvfq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fKPdgr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giWIr7U1deA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntvp1"&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f8WmqO"&gt;The next big Marvel movie is the first to center an Asian superhero (and has an almost entirely Asian cast) and it looks very, very fun even if you don’t know the backstory and &lt;a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Shang-Chi"&gt;connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a&gt;. Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi, whose father trained him as a child to be an assassin. He tries to escape and live a normal life but as anyone who has ever watched a superhero movie knows, it ain’t that easy. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Awkwafina also star in &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,&lt;/em&gt; coming to theaters September 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FG26RZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/On4v1gNJkrE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oZMzpo"&gt;Annette&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kPckMD"&gt;Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard play a comedian and opera singer who fall in love and have a child they name Annette, “a mysterious little girl with an exceptional destiny.”  The trailer has that French cinema feel, for sure, which makes sense, since &lt;em&gt;Annette&lt;/em&gt; is the English-language debut of French director Leos Carax. &lt;em&gt;Annette&lt;/em&gt; will open the 74th Cannes Film Festival on July 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yYkxUl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-Mmnk0LZLU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wrXtlc"&gt;Fathom &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6HDsVS"&gt;Scientists Michelle Fournet and Ellen Garland embark on separate research trips in opposite hemispheres to try to better understand the songs of humpback whales. No one really knows why whales “sing,” despite decades of research. It’s challenging work that one of the scientists compares to “pointing all of our satellites skyward and listening from a sign from outer space.” The trailer is just beautiful (obviously watch with the sound on).  &lt;em&gt;Fathom&lt;/em&gt; arrives on Apple TV Plus June 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sALjCB"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="CWRzzU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3v8n_8-QqA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GE0M4W"&gt;Here Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9eszwm"&gt;Billy Crystal wrote, directed, and stars in this movie about an aging comedy writer who befriends a woman (Tiffany Haddish) whose boyfriend bet on a date with him at an auction. Who would not be content to just watch Haddish and Crystal just bounce jokes off each other for 90 minutes? The underlying premise, though, is that Crystal is losing his memory and Haddish steps up to help him. &lt;em&gt;Here Today&lt;/em&gt; arrives in theaters May 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yVXoUU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9Q4zZS2v1k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8fA9eW"&gt;The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uxBpNr"&gt;I continue to be surprised at the endurance of The Conjuring movies, which continue to be quite scary. I have to be honest that I’m not a super big fan of these movies because of the way they often put children in terrifying situations, a theme which seems to persist in this latest installment. Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are back to investigate a murder committed by a young man who claims he was possessed by the devil. &lt;em&gt;The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It&lt;/em&gt; premieres on HBO Max and in theaters on June 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone deciphered the Ted Lasso shortbread recipe from Apple’s Spring Loaded event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2cbUx1T-EnEoNzr1RiJ88xhlik=/251x0:3491x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69181353/1310836738.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by 27th Annual SAG Awards/Getty Images for WarnerMedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5eVII"&gt;During Tuesday’s Spring Loaded event, Apple announced (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;among other things&lt;/a&gt;) that the second season of its runaway hit show &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;drop on July 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. This is extremely good news for fans of the show (including myself) who have missed the earnest football coach with the impossibly sunny outlook on life, which provided a bit of a respite during the coronavirus pandemic last summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2J6Vb"&gt;At the very end of Spring Loaded, however, there was a &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso-&lt;/em&gt;related Easter egg: a graphic of a little box with the text “Ted Lasso’s Secret Shortbread (Makes about one box).” The recipe itself was barely visible. But eagle-eyed developer David Smith was &lt;a href="https://www.david-smith.org/blog/2021/04/21/breadcrumbs/"&gt;able to read the text&lt;/a&gt;, and Googled it, only to find it matched a &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020851-bittersweet-brownie-shortbread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; recipe&lt;/a&gt; for shortbread (albeit a slightly different recipe than Ted’s). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hrfXiPQ_-Js1hcJQjeb3_RwTaik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22467320/ted_lasso_recipe.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n8hFOz"&gt;He blogged about it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dqJMbm"&gt;Looking closely at the fractional letters visible I’m pretty confident that this first line reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d05zAA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 1/2 cups / 340 grams cold unsalted butter cut into 1/2 inch pieces plus more for greasing pan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iTr3K"&gt;This is definitely a recipe for shortbread, I mean what else would need that much butter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="H8tYXH"&gt;That really is a lot of goddamned butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zM5Icz"&gt;For those who don’t watch the show (and why the heck not?), the shortbread cookies are a key part of the plot. Ted is trying to win over Rebecca, the owner of the English football team he’s suddenly coaching, and presents her with a small pink box that has the shortbread inside (we later discover that Ted has been baking the shortbread himself, not purchasing them, because that’s Ted for ya).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePLF2l"&gt;Rebecca enjoys them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/35uz58gexTwque1gn5aIUIqCxOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22467315/ted_lasso_cookies.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy44AH"&gt;There are not many pure, good things on the internet anymore (she said as she wrote for an internet news site haha &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I did not mean &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we are great), but a little sleuthing to uncover a shortbread recipe from the best show on streaming reminds me of those innocent days gone by. Like &lt;a href="https://ted-lasso.fandom.com/wiki/Believe"&gt;Ted reminds us&lt;/a&gt;: you just have to believe.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QTjyHn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s Spring Loaded event: the 8 biggest announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $999&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,189&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $34 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has knocked down its price to $199 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest you can grab a pair right now is for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Weird Apple design: ‘Spring Loaded’ edition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l545-m0sx8cwjt0bJs9_bsClobA=/231x0:2637x1604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176346/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_9.33.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iMac’s big chin.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UyKg81"&gt;Apple’s product design is usually very good, setting industry standards for how many of the gadgets and computers we use every day look and feel. But the company’s many hits make the less obvious design decisions stand out that much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtX65y"&gt;Thanks to the huge amount of new stuff Apple introduced at its “Spring Loaded” event on Tuesday, we have a lot of new Apple designs to scrutinize. While the company generally did pretty well with this round of updates, there are still a few things that made us raise our eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8n6Tlw"&gt;The iMac still has a big chin&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twrBv0Hp1a2Gbkio5xPerUdAiLY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465084/apple_new_imac_spring21_pf_blue_04202021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iMac and its large chin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hMoHaK"&gt;I think Apple’s new iMacs look &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good — except for that darn chin, which, once again, proudly protrudes from the bottom of the computer’s screen like Johnny Bravo’s impressive jawline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlzqib"&gt;To be fair, Apple did what it could to make the chin look nice. The pastel colors are really fun, and I’m happy Apple removed the giant logo that graced the chin of previous iMac generations. (Remove the “MacBook Air” text from my laptop’s bezel next, Apple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqVNyt"&gt;And I get that the chin is necessary to allow iMac to be as ridiculously thin as it is. Instead of putting the computer’s internals behind the screen, Apple has stuffed them into the chin. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zTSll4M3e0UferpP1mpfN9_rAxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461554/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_9.29.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iMac’s logic board and cooling system, stuffed into the chin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nFskwN"&gt;Someday, though, I’d like to see Apple release an iMac with no chin at all — just a screen that’s a computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kUMifA"&gt;The iMac has white bezels&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TplkHXkzNIO-1EvVBPr0BTiFU3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461521/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_9.02.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The white bezels on the new iMac.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vow78N"&gt;Perhaps the most surprising thing to me about the new iMac was its white bezels. Most of Apple’s recent computers have had black bezels, which typically do a better job of hiding the edges of the display and make it less obvious where the screen ends and the bezel begins. (The non-Retina MacBook Air, with its silver bezels, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687417/apple-discontinues-12-inch-macbook"&gt;hung around until 2019&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ypnoiw"&gt;But again, I have to give Apple some credit for its choice here. Black bezels paired with the bright new iMac colors would be quite jarring — the white looks great with the new iMac colors. And these white bezels are &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; smaller than the giant black bezels on the Intel-based iMacs that are still on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1wyXQ"&gt;The new iMacs join Apple’s base iPad, the iPad mini, and the iPod touch in the white bezel club. It remains to be seen if the new iMac joining it is foreshadowing others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="luxA65"&gt;The curved corner keys on the iMac’s Magic Keyboard don’t look good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="USJjPE"&gt;The new Magic Keyboard has some nice upgrades, including a Touch ID sensor (which comes with more expensive models), new function keys, and color-matched aluminum. But the look of just four of the keys on the keyboard makes it much worse than the previous model, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrTIvh"&gt;Check out the keys on the four corners of the new Magic Keyboard. Notice how they each have one corner with a much wider curve than the rest?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aruhuy301-SGWzFmr40ygZ_o4ho=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22463676/apple_new_imac_spring21_magic_keyboard_with_numeric_keypad_yellow_04202021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Magic Keyboard, with the weirdly rounded corner keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CZsxxs"&gt;I just think they don’t look very good. I get that they better match the wider curves of the keyboard itself, but I think they look odd when all of the other keys have four corners with exactly the same curvature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNtCBI"&gt;Here’s an image slider comparing the old keyboard to the new. The uniform corners on the old model look a lot better, in my opinion. Look at that bad right arrow key on the new one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oj5FsC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10459575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zulWkv"&gt;And by the way, it looks like the Magic Trackpad that comes with the new iMac has the same wider corners as the new keyboard, too, based on a picture from Apple’s website. So if you want your keyboard and trackpad to have matched corners, you’re going to have to pay extra to get the new trackpad. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NqsP6iX7NdItMBo00JarMHxtBf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464798/Screen_Shot_2021_04_23_at_8.05.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Magic Keyboard and Trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oDWNW5"&gt;The new iMac does not have a touchscreen, despite looking an awful lot like another Apple device with a touchscreen&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PK1hbfo64f_Ttk3X62ceNRe7QCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22463711/Screen_Shot_2021_04_22_at_5.00.09_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hmm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xywJHp"&gt;The iPad Pro’s front camera is still in portrait instead of landscape &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8D7zOTtph2Rx7r36uibXLbUHcjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461630/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_10.06.27_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Pro’s portrait front camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZFsDj"&gt;Apple, once again, has released a new iPad Pro with a front camera that’s placed on top of the device in portrait mode instead of on top in landscape mode. That means if you use any keyboard case that requires the tablet to be in landscape and you want to take a video call (which is something a lot of people are doing right now), the camera is awkwardly off to the side instead of right above the middle of your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6bLbU"&gt;To try to get around this, Apple upgraded the iPad Pro’s new front camera to make it an ultrawide, and the company debuted a new technology that can automatically keep you in frame during video calls. But we won’t know for sure if that will keep you better-centered until we can test it for ourselves. And it won’t solve the problem of forcing you to look to the side if you want to look directly into the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5HEigT"&gt;The new 12.9-inch iPad Pro isn’t compatible with the original Magic Keyboard case&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tn1jiUHUdYBgvGh-7YNN1N45UPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19911773/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kkm8wv"&gt;Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399095/apple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-2020-models-magic-keyboard-incompatible"&gt;isn’t compatible&lt;/a&gt; with the original Magic Keyboard case, which fits the 2018 and 2020 models of the tablet. It’s not exactly clear why, but it could be because the new iPad Pro is 0.5mm thicker than the 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4JSu4"&gt;Regardless of what the reason is, though, if you’re planning to buy the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro and want to use a Magic Keyboard along with it, you’re also going to have to pony up $349 to buy the new version of the Magic Keyboard case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xOcIoh"&gt;AirTags don’t have a built-in keychain loop &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuDV4kEAC6aBIbowdTFix0Yz13g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461541/Apple_airtag_front_and_back_emoji_2up_042021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTag tracker doesn’t have a keychain loop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LbHWqz"&gt;Apple’s new AirTag item trackers sure seem like they should have an easy way to directly attach to something, but Apple decided not to include a small hole for, say, a keychain or a string. (Yes, I side with my colleague Chaim Gartenberg in his great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;AirTags keychain loop debate&lt;/a&gt; with Jon Porter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SV6BzT"&gt;The Magic Mouse’s charging port is still on the bottom, five and a half years later&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JY7mfNejfVDbX486GvNIzYAolMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9833361/Apple_Magic_Mouse_Bad_Design_2.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is still how you charge the Magic Mouse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K2aplw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394552/apple-new-magic-mouse-charging-port-bottom-lightning"&gt;I already wrote about this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kr2fYZ"&gt;There is some hope: it looks like Apple fixed its TV remote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khCLGC"&gt;Apple’s new Siri remote, with its iPod-like scroll wheel, a five-way click pad, and smaller touchpad, looks like it will address complaints about the previous Apple TV remote’s annoyingly oversensitive touch controls. And the new aluminum design with black buttons should make it easier to see the buttons on the remote compared to the mostly black design of the previous model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vARJrX6IqEqGeZfJ0dONZWIz6bU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461483/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_8.40.52_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s seemingly fixed TV remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xIAA6P"&gt;The new remote looks great. Apple can change! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro won’t work with the original $349 Magic Keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1j8ntN2FIvbvCJtwgIuxpUeXV-Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176079/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y1jUjU"&gt;Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro has a big catch: it turns out that the new 2021 model is incompatible with the old Magic Keyboard folio case for the 2018 and 2020 models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Caamg9"&gt;The news, first reported by French site &lt;a href="https://www.igen.fr/accessoires/2021/04/lipad-pro-129-de-2021-besoin-dun-nouveau-magic-keyboard-selon-apple-122043"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iGeneration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and confirmed via sources familiar with the matter to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;means that if you’re looking to upgrade from a 2018 or 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro to the refreshed model (with its Mini LED display, faster M1 processor, and upgraded camera), you’ll also have to shell out an extra $349 for a new Magic Keyboard case, even if you already bought the prior version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1cohH8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bad news for 2020 iPad Pro owners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="08S7i0"&gt;The 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro is slightly thicker than the 2020 version: the new model measures in at 6.4mm thick, or 0.5mm thicker than the 5.9mm 2020 model, an increase that’s speculated to be due to the more complex Mini LED screen technology. The updated 11-inch iPad Pro, on the other hand, will still be compatible with the older Magic Keyboard case (it doesn’t have an upgraded screen and its dimensions haven’t changed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hG6aB1"&gt;The good news is that the new 2021 Magic Keyboard case is backwards compatible with the previous 2018 and 2020 iterations of the iPad Pro, so if you end up shelling out for the new model, you’ll be able to use it with older iPads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVREGv"&gt;But it’s certainly frustrating for anyone who already owns a 12.9-inch iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard to see that upgrading won’t just mean spending at least $1,099 to get the benefits of the new model — they’ll also have to spend the extra $349 for a new Magic Keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thank you for the memories, Siri Remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rT4fXeZaUdJ_leb-zSgmxY9I6Vs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176015/VRG_ILLO_4545_Siri_Remote.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Wc76v"&gt;The Apple TV remote is gone and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;new remote&lt;/a&gt; — with the exact same name, considerably more buttons, and a two-tone color scheme straight out of 2010 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394196/apple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons"&gt;has replaced it&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of people have rejoiced this move, but I am here to mourn a remote that had no business being as captivating for my thumb as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g07aNG"&gt;Technically called the Siri Remote, the super-slim minimalist remote launched in 2015 alongside the fourth-gen Apple TV (now known as the Apple TV HD). It was the third remote designed by Apple to control your TV and the first one to include a touchpad or microphones. The Siri Remote was named for the big Siri button below the touchpad and was meant to make the digital assistant a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/9/10948544/apple-tv-is-finally-getting-voice-dictation"&gt;more natural part of the way&lt;/a&gt; you interacted with your television. It didn’t do that for me, personally, but I may be an outlier on all things Apple remote. I just used it as a remote to control my TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjjh1s"&gt;I loved the Lightning port it used for charging. It was too thin to use the tiny coin cell batteries the previous Apple remotes used (and that I never had lying around my house). I could let it go months between charges, and then I just had to plug it in with the same cord I used to charge my phone. It was a nice little convenience I appreciated, and far more expensive and capable remotes, like Logitech’s recently discontinued line of Harmony remotes, felt old-fashioned next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAWrUr"&gt;The Siri Remote was also one of the first set-top box remotes I used that let me put away my TV remote. The fourth-generation Apple TV was the first with volume control over HDMI CEC. What that meant was you could use the included Siri remote to control your TV. While it didn’t have a dedicated power button like the new remote does, it was easy for me to turn on my TV by pressing any button on the remote. I could even control my Sonos soundbar with the volume buttons. Turning the TV off did require an adventure to the Settings menu on the Apple TV if you were like me and didn’t know there was a shortcut for sleeping all devices.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Being able to control everything with one tiny remote was a welcome change of pace from juggling multiple remotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EodowT"&gt;But I didn’t just love the Siri Remote because it gave me limited control of my TV or had a Lightning port. It was also because of the touchpad, which made skimming through content on Netflix or Plex or fast-forwarding through a show on Hulu an absolute breeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THBRLK"&gt;At least I think so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xrna5"&gt;While some (again maybe it was just me!) have praised the Siri Remote’s touchpad, the majority of people — including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/22268724/apple-tv-remote-game-boy-color-mod"&gt;bulk&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9297131/new-apple-tv-update-remote-2015-hands-on-video-photos"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; here at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300891/apple-tv-siri-remote-touchpad-button-design-form-function"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, every Apple TV user on Reddit, and my mother — absolutely hated it.  Many complained about the sensitivity of the touchpad, which let you fly across the screen with a swipe but required a far gentler touch if you just wanted to pop over a row. They also complained about how easy it was to accidentally select something or lose the remote due to its size. My mother even complained because she somehow managed to shatter her remote with an accidental drop onto her tile floor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of a broken Apple Remote. Followed by the text: Oops fell off chair. Put some tape on it. Should I get a new one? Still works ...." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQl0BSdgj56WFzsGDWr3wTJuVwM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22463422/Capto_Capture_2021_04_22_05_43_11_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Alex Cranz / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has not been fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bccDQY"&gt;I loved it precisely because it was so sensitive. I run my trackpad and mouse at similarly high sensitivity levels and like the ability to yeet across a screen with a flick. With the Siri Remote, I could flit from place to place or rewind back exactly 10 seconds with a very careful swipe of the remote. The tvOS user interface worked perfectly with the touchpad and every app icon’s appearance shifted slightly as you dragged your finger back and forth across the remote. More than once I returned to the home screen when someone called, and I used the remote and the app icons up on my TV as a digital fidget toy while I chatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnNBeB"&gt;The sensitivity of the touchpad also resolved naysayers’ other major problem with the remote: its size. I loved how it could fit in my extremely small hands and make me feel like the rest of you feel when you hold a normal-size remote. Many people complained about how it could slip in between cushions on the couch or disappear under an entertainment center or chair. But I’ve lost it exactly once, and that was because I stuck it in a jacket pocket and then tossed the jacket in the laundry. I never lost it when it slipped between or beneath cushions. It took just the barest of pressure on the couch to depress the touchpad’s button. Simply sitting down would reveal the remote’s location whether I wanted to find it or not. Finding it under furniture was easy, too. I just squatted down and blindly reached. If things changed on the TV I knew I’d come in contact with some part of the touchpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaXRzQ"&gt;I can only hope the touchpad built into the directional pad of the new remote is as sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2Hhx0"&gt;And it’s really everything about the new remote that has me missing the old one (which technically survives even now in a basket of remotes by my couch). The new remote looks so drastically different and is such a major improvement on others’ complaints that I feel sort of how that dad who never amounted to much after high school must feel when he sees his large son dominate in the popular sport of their hometown. “Oh,” I think, “this is what it was supposed to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: the two Apple events from this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12 and an AirTag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUcRPCQrksqNZ5vErcFW0gEowKU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175456/vpavic_4547_20210421_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HiSohv"&gt;You may have heard of the new Apple products announced at the company’s “Spring Loaded” event this week — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;the redesigned colorful iMac&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;location-tracking AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and the boosted specs on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;the next iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. But there was another big event focused on Apple this week: on Capitol Hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBOZAJ"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/0Wmd05zs48HYLqPq2AkWK3" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9H9lt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1HLZF"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, co-&lt;/em&gt;hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;Tuesday hardware event&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; news editor Chaim Gartenberg as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;Wednesday’s congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to antitrust in the App Store with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; politics reporter Makena Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXqqlO"&gt;The show bridges the gap between Apple announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt; and Tile speaking in front of Congress the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
