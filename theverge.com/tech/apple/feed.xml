    <title>New Trailers: The Wheel of Time, The Witcher, Lightyear, House of Gucci, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cewKpItAR-wkhYlwNAx5kLx4woI=/204x0:1089x590/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70071195/wheelotime.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rosamund Pike stars in The Wheel of Time | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZozKfRqvA&amp;amp;ab_channel=AmazonPrimeVideo" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zfaWAk"&gt;I’m close to giving up on &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;; the latest episode spends a lot of time building up to a twist that makes very little sense given the season so far. They only have three episodes left and a lot of plot to push forward. Luckily, &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; is getting good and juicy with the Roy siblings choosing sides, and I’m also getting caught up in &lt;em&gt;Maid&lt;/em&gt;, mainly because of Margaret Qualley’s strong performance as Alex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lj9744"&gt;So much to watch, so little time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAZ0Mi"&gt;We’re heavy into the sci-fi and fantasy realms in this week’s roundup, but there’s a little fashion and murder-mystery as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XgKrS7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11ZozKfRqvA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="x9cdzq"&gt;The Wheel of Time &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gPYLDh"&gt;We’ve seen a few glimpses of&lt;em&gt; The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; series based on the books by Robert Jordan, but this latest trailer shows us the beginning of the story, with Moiraine Damodred of the Aes Sedai trying to figure out how to stop the Dark One. She finds five magic using people she thinks could be the key (or keys) to saving the world (whether they’re up for it or not). Rosamund Pike, Daniel Henney, Josha Stradowski, Marcus Rutherford, and Zoe Robins star in &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time,&lt;/em&gt; which drops the first episode of its eight-episode season on Amazon Prime Video November 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk16bQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: You can watch this trailer as a “360 experience” (I didn’t think it really added a lot here, though)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QZUAXf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WX6e6ZLNmtA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tptg94"&gt;The Witcher&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nromUq"&gt;We’ve seen a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570627/the-witcher-season-two-teaser-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;teasers&lt;/a&gt; and sneak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22462967/the-witcher-season-2-trailer-netflix-geeked-week"&gt;peeks&lt;/a&gt; and first-look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691354/witcher-season-2-blood-origin-trailer-teaser-watch-premiere-date-netflix"&gt;clips&lt;/a&gt; from the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; and now we have a full-length trailer with some juicy details about what’s next for Geralt of Rivia and company. War with the Nilfgaardian Empire is looming, along with the possible “end of days” (which Geralt scoffs at), Geralt is hunting enormous monsters, and Ciri is tapping in to her powers while Jaskier is befriending some small rodents (rats? mice? something else entirely?). Henry Cavill, Freya Allen, Anya Chalotra, Joey Batey, Anna Shaffer, and Kim Bodnia star in season 2 of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, coming to Netflix December 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JOrHoq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BwPL0Md_QFQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Y3IoJ4"&gt;Lightyear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HbroDw"&gt;At last, a Pixar movie that doesn’t immediately look like it will tear the hearts out of parents (honestly, I am still traumatized by &lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Toy Story 3&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt; is the backstory of the “real” astronaut on whom the the Buzz Lightyear action figure from &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; is based. The teaser shows what looks like a familiar space exploration adventure, with the requisite aliens and spaceships, and Chris Evans provides the hero’s voice. &lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt; will be released June 17th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yZ8vMx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGNnpVKxV6s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xyMnmc"&gt;House of Gucci&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rrcHc8"&gt;We have a second trailer for the movie about the Gucci family starring Lady Gaga, and of course everyone looks fabulous and beautiful, even though the “Italian” accents from the lead actors are... a little off? Based on the book by Sara Gay Forden, &lt;em&gt;House of Gucci&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Patrizia Reggiani’s marriage to Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), and her plot to hire an assassin to kill him. Jared Leto, Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, and Salma Hayek also star in &lt;em&gt;House of Gucci &lt;/em&gt;which arrives in theaters November 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uFQHhE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_h6DQWE2Mk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aBfFKD"&gt;Servant &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BF1ATL"&gt;Look, you can only show me so many long, ominous, darkly-lit hallways before the trick gets old. In its first season this show had promise (and Lauren Ambrose gives a tremendous performance as Dorothy), but by season three it defies logic (and is beyond sadistic) that Dorothy’s family would continue to hide from her the truth about what happened to her baby. Maybe they’ll finally do the ethical thing. But now, apparently, the show is more interested in the cult that nanny Leanne (the servant of the show’s title) escaped from. If you’re still hoping for an M. Night Shyamalan plot twist, you can check out season three of &lt;em&gt;Servant&lt;/em&gt; on Apple Plus TV starting January 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldIe5z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp16VV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hMRMN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly discontinues the 21.5-inch Intel-powered iMac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple iMac Hardware Shoot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mGhr4ZKcZLQ1TaMzQ6tvZW3Xtp4=/0x3:7345x4900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70070602/1065384720.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Olly Curtis/MacFormat Magazine/Future via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EEA47d"&gt;Apple has apparently pulled its 21.5-inch Intel-based iMac from shelves (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/apple-discontinues-intel-based-21-5-inch-imac/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Its discontinuation doesn’t come as much of a surprise, now that Apple is transitioning from using Intel processors to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;in-house M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aha88K"&gt;The 21.5-inch iMac was still available after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max"&gt;Apple’s October 18th Unleashed event&lt;/a&gt; — it didn’t appear to go missing until sometime this week, according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;. The $1,099 21.5-inch iMac, which came with a 2.3GHz dual-core 7th-Gen Intel Core i5 and an Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, is no longer found on the list of available iMacs on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac-imac"&gt;Apple’s online store&lt;/a&gt;. A “Buy” button also doesn’t appear for the 21.5-inch iMac on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/"&gt;Apple’s product comparison&lt;/a&gt; page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kq2X6M"&gt;We reached out to Apple to confirm the changes, but didn’t immediately receive a response. However, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;that the machine is being discontinued and won’t be sold through Apple’s online store or in its retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iMac 21.5-inch no Buy button" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b9iluU0J1oDkmKKq_-1Bf_NdmA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972383/imac_21_5_inch_apple_store.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XxhHmI"&gt;Apple hasn’t eliminated its entire lineup of Intel-based iMacs just yet — it’s still selling &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac-imac"&gt;the 27-inch Intel-based iMac&lt;/a&gt;, which sports up to a 3.6GHz 10-core Intel Core i9 CPU, at a starting price of $1799.99. As &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes, you can still purchase &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/apple-discontinues-intel-based-21-5-inch-imac/"&gt;a refurbished 21.5-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s online store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arlcCG"&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341882/apple-discontinuing-21-5-inch-imac"&gt;Apple discontinued the 512GB and 1TB configurations&lt;/a&gt; of the 21.5-inch iMac, so the company has been slowly phasing out this model for a while. And since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Apple debuted its thinner, more colorful M1-powered iMacs in April&lt;/a&gt;, it only makes sense for Apple to clear some space on its shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cMcUQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mac-shaped pillow makers are back so you can cover your couch in computers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kidsmGdfuAQnzGLmB446m_LV7xM=/0x29:680x482/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70070303/9a7f391962bd6d6325579b959c662279_original.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Throwboy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MbSbzA"&gt;A company called Throwboy is &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-2-by-throwboy/description"&gt;back with another Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; for a collection of pillows shaped like classic Macs, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/18/17715884/throwboy-pillow-retro-macintosh-imac-iphone-ipod-nostalgia"&gt;its 2018 line of Apple-inspired plushes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s fittingly called The Iconic Pillow Collection 2, and features pillows shaped like soft versions of Apple’s Lisa, iBook, and both the cheese grater and cube flavors of Power Mac. For Apple history buffs who want to spruce up their living or bedrooms, it may be a campaign worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xB3tvA"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-by-throwboy/description"&gt;its original collection&lt;/a&gt; (which featured pillows shaped like the Finder icon, original Macintosh, and iPods), Throwboy tactfully didn’t mention specific computer names, and it refrained from doing so this time around as well. The Lisa-shaped pillow is called the 1983, the iMac G4-esque one is branded the 2002, and so on. On its Kickstarter page, the company says it picked these specific computers because they were “swing for the fences” designs that people still love.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UM30jdXoFIM2OI-BVvNAt1qCRhQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968405/d6c64d48dd1df102720c22a37e137832_original.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Throwboy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: a (hopefully) safe naming scheme.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TCp80r"&gt;Truly, there are some stunning designs on display in this Kickstarter. I’m pretty sure I haven’t seen a laptop-shaped pillow like the 1999, and I’m &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;sure I’ve never seen an iMac G4-shaped pillow. It’s unclear how comfortable these pillows will be on a couch, or if they’ll hold up in a pillow fight (though I already want to wield the 2002 like I’m Darth Mac), but as conversation starters they’d be hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ljol61"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNym5z"&gt;That’s not even mentioning the ports — yes, at the same time Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;adding back HDMI and MagSafe back to its real laptops&lt;/a&gt;, Throwboy has gone and added port-shaped stitching to Apple-shaped pillows. I’d say more about how much this fills me with joy, but I think I’ll let the pictures say hello for themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/461ynHXR66vvKOB5VQyACkM4x0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968408/acb9cf6f6c229217ceae429182702802_original.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Throwboy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeah, but does your pillow have FireWire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8YBYUs0eBSsC2-PPtsvE13ht2ok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968409/440e63f486ee465a06bbde69888b5321_original.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Throwboy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the only time a keyboard feeling pillowy is a good thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pUMCjw"&gt;While Throwboy’s Kickstarter campaign for the original Iconic collection appears to be successful (&lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-by-throwboy/comments"&gt;the comments&lt;/a&gt; are largely filled with people who received and are happy with their pillows, and you can buy them &lt;a href="https://throwboy.com/collections/throwboy-pillows"&gt;on Throwboy’s website&lt;/a&gt;), it’s always worth proceeding with caution when it comes to crowdfunding. Projects, even from successful creators, can run late, turn out different than expected, or even get cancelled for one reason or another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMwdAc"&gt;If that’s a risk you’re willing to take (and it apparently is for a lot of people; the project met its $10,000 goal in its first day), these &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-2-by-throwboy/description"&gt;are some extremely fun pillow designs&lt;/a&gt; if you’re in the market for some Apple-themed home decor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: Facebook goes meta and reviews of the Pixel 6 and MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Igz9YvL8AHurUZ0VNWVkPp4-v5Y=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70065057/verge_vjeran_pavic_meta_3_20211028_3000.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="bGeO9G"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BdVvk"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast,&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz (that’s me), deputy editor Dan Seifert (that’s not me), and senior reporter Alex Heath (also not me) join Nilay and Dieter to talk about Facebook’s big rebranding, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753184/ifixit-apple-polishing-cloth-19-repair-backorder"&gt;expensive polishing cloths&lt;/a&gt;, our reviews of the Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, and both flavors of the new MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit actually tore down Apple’s backordered $19 screen cloth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X9235Iq9RFn0msZiVqbVb_uj64c=/0x319:6899x4918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064814/finallayout.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZkUv0"&gt;I can’t say I expected there to be more news about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;Apple’s $19 Screen Polishing cloth&lt;/a&gt;, but here we are. Not only has iFixit given it the teardown treatment and a (perhaps slightly tongue-in-cheek) repair score, but it’s apparently become one of Apple’s hardest-to-get products. And yes, to reiterate, we are still talking about a cloth made to clean your devices’ screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x42ohl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/technology/apple-polishing-cloth.html"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 6.3-inch-sided square of fabric is now backordered, with Apple’s website saying that you won’t get it for 10-12 &lt;em&gt;weeks&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;meaning it’ll get delivered sometime between January 7th and January 21st, 2022. If you order pretty much any configuration of the redesigned MacBook Pro that the cloth launched with, you’ll get your custom-built laptop at least a week before you get your cleaning cloth — and that’s with the worst-case estimate for the MacBook and best-case one for the cloth. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DthHDomLTUNCKblqE2HtQVOd4RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967806/Screen_Shot_2021_10_29_at_13.29.29.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not too bad, in comparison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bd9KG"&gt;Why is this happening? How did it catch the attention of &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;? Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown"&gt;looking at iFixit’s teardown&lt;/a&gt; will provide some answers! (Spoiler: nope.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQbSYT"&gt;iFixit doesn’t have a dedicated page for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin"&gt;The Cloth&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll have to scroll past a bunch of boring details about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;the MacBook that I’m definitely not drooling over&lt;/a&gt; to see the results. Once you do, though, its a surprisingly in-depth look at the accessory. iFixit reveals that it’s actually two pieces of material glued together and even takes a microscope to it to compare it to regular old microfiber. The teardown is brief (obviously, it’s literally a cloth), but well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1VBQZsZkcoliO91AQdlJeqkmpgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967824/interiorshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Breaking news: it’s a cloth &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; a potential ravioli.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dIUev8"&gt;But when compared to the actually decent (for Apple, at least) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22517104"&gt;reparability of the new MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, the Polishing Cloth gets a disappointing 0 / 10 repair score for distracting the iFixit crew. That’s really a bummer, because if you accidentally cut yours to pieces like iFixit did, you’ll have to wait a couple months to get a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhLKrw"&gt;Finally, if you needed yet another reason to check out &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown"&gt;iFixit’s article&lt;/a&gt; (besides, you know, the in-depth technical breakdown of Apple’s new laptops) just know that it has one of the funniest &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZVkW9p-cCU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Psycho&lt;/em&gt; references&lt;/a&gt; I’ve seen for a while. Hats off to you, iFixit, for providing us with something fun to look at on a Friday (and for coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702324/on-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s birthday party&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7022385139283922182?is_copy_url=0&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;sender_device=pc&amp;amp;sender_web_id=6998606657735525894"&gt;teach people how to fix JoyCon&lt;/a&gt; last weekend). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit teardown of the 2021 MacBook Pro reveals easier battery swaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stretchy adhesive being pulled out of the MacBook case" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4XKs1Pzbz9ciQvtwenwg88di68=/0x3:7360x4910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064757/MBP_M1_2021_42e3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The trackpad has to be removed to reveal two of the pull tabs | Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwFeoc"&gt;Online tech repair guide and parts retailer iFixit has published its &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown"&gt;latest teardown&lt;/a&gt; for the new 2021 MacBook Pro and reveals at least one small win for reparability: the ability to replace the battery pack modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwjDJY"&gt;The battery modules in the new MacBook Pros, much like many mobile devices, are now attached via adhesive strips with pull tabs. This makes it easier to remove them, as long as none of the tabs rip while pulling. The trackpad needs to also be carefully removed to reach the remaining pull tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2W2ZP-_AkC5s1ZYf852Xw5BjVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967611/MBP_M1_2021_117_Updated3f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iInWyk"&gt;Batteries in MacBook Pros used to have their own frame or shell, which made them easier to install or remove via screws or locking tabs (although that takes more interior space). Starting in 2012, Apple wanted to make laptops thinner, so battery structures were removed to save some real estate. The biggest issue with MacBook Pro model years 2012–2020 was that Apple used glue to all but permanently fuse the battery to the top case of the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2L7j3q"&gt;HDMI and SD card ports are fixed to the logic board, but the rest of the ports are modular, though you would have to remove the whole logic board to replace them. Fans and the speakers also require a logic board removal before a replacement is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X4IIqJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple MacBook Pro 14 and 16 review: return to form","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oglYwI"&gt;The only real remaining qualms are that replacing the screen would mean losing True Tone, and replacing Touch ID would lose its main ability. While Touch ID in iPhones being non-repairable used to make sense for security reasons, it’s interesting to see no new development on reparability here since Apple’s new wireless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397196/magic-keyboard-touch-id-m1-mac-macbook-intel"&gt;Touch ID keyboard&lt;/a&gt; can be paired to different M1 computers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple MacBook Pro 14 and 16 review: return to form</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s new pro laptops right the wrongs of the past half decade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1T949o"&gt;Let’s start simply: the new MacBook Pros with M1 Pro and M1 Max chips are incredible — the fastest laptops we’ve ever tested in some tasks, with some of the longest battery life we’ve ever seen. Apple’s big bet on moving away from Intel CPUs and AMD GPUs in favor of its own Apple Silicon chips is paying off in meaningful ways, and if you can afford one of these machines, you will be very happy with them. They’re great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQBber"&gt;That said, the new MacBook Pros are not without their quirks, and the Mac software ecosystem is still catching up to Apple Silicon in general and Apple’s pro hardware GPU ideas in particular. So things aren’t quite as simple as our first impression of the MacBook Air with an M1 chip last year — depending on your needs and the tools you use, the Mac software ecosystem might not let you actually get the most out of these machines for a while yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR96Q7"&gt;But make no mistake: the performance Apple has delivered with these machines combined with the battery life we’ve seen in our tests means that there’s a new standard in the industry — one that Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and every other laptop maker will be hard-pressed to reach anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4wYkT4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834286"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="tzzpM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834290"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3nktvm9VipSbg-OXh6bRe6D_G1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965897/akrales_211028_4820_0523.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new MacBook Pro 16 (left) and 14 have bright Mini LED displays that support Apple’s ProMotion 120Hz high refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qz1Ars"&gt;We reviewed three of the new MacBook Pros: a $4,399 16-inch model with an M1 Max processor with 32 GPU cores, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage; and 16- and 14-inch models with M1 Pros with 16-core GPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage that list for $3,099 and $2,899 respectively. These are expensive computers from the jump: even the base model 14-inch starts at $1,999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0wt43"&gt;The first thing you’re going to notice after you take a deep breath and spend the money is that these new MacBook Pros are much more substantial than the outgoing models. They’re bigger and heavier than previous MacBook Pros, and they are more squared off. The 16-inch is even just a little thicker than the older 16-inch MacBook Pro. Surprisingly, the extra thickness is mostly in the display — the actual body is only ever so slightly thicker than my old 16-inch Intel MacBook Pro, but you can really see it in the lid because it no longer tapers at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHZMWY"&gt;This is good news. Apple has made so many compromises in the name of thinness for so long that it was about time for the pendulum to swing back, and the extra thickness allows for better cooling and the return of some useful ports. On the right side, you’ve got a Thunderbolt 4 port, an HDMI port, and a full-size SDXC slot; on the left side, you’ve got two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a MagSafe power connector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XW1Zrh"&gt;The ports are wonderful, and I’m glad they’re back. A few people on our video team said the SD card slot is enough of a reason to upgrade all by itself. But be warned that the ports aren’t top-spec: it’s an HDMI 2.0 port, not 2.1, and the SD card slot is only UHS-II, not the faster UHS-III or SD Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A side profile of the MacBook Pro 16 showing its full-size SD card slot, Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port, and HDMI port." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iiNwvEfKeYRv7wxhPp-iD1CHHtQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965874/akrales_211027_4820_0121.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now departing Dongletown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1q3ONclBy-y1_pfbExaQRZSNPk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965886/akrales_211027_4820_0310.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro 16 can only fast charge with a 140-watt or higher charging brick connected to its MagSafe port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8vPQM9"&gt;So yes, the ports are definitely more convenient, and totally fine for most situations, but there are still reasons to visit dongletown. For example, macOS Monterey now supports variable refresh rate external displays using a Vesa standard called Adaptive-Sync, but Apple tells me you’ll need a Thunderbolt to DisplayPort dongle for that. I also ran into a strange bug where sending audio out over HDMI resulted in stuttering video and glitchy audio, which Apple says it is looking into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NA57lx"&gt;The MagSafe 3 connector is great, a true classic. It’s strong enough to drag the MacBook Pro along a desk if you pull it straight, but instantly disconnects if it’s yanked at an angle. I missed it terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ah0lIm"&gt;The confusion arises at the other end of the MagSafe cable, which is USB-C. You can charge all of these machines over USB-C using any of the ports, and you can fast charge the 14-inch MacBook Pro using a 100-watt USB-C adapter and a USB-C cable that supports that much power. But you can only fast-charge the 16-inch MacBook Pro using the Magsafe connector connected to a 140-watt-or-higher power brick — MagSafe is the only port that supports the newest high-power USB-C PD standard. The other ports do not. What’s more, there’s no indicator anywhere that you’re fast charging, so you just have to plug in and hope for the best. At this point, “plug in and hope for the best” is the unofficial USB-C slogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybkfPq"&gt;USB-C charging is overall one of the most confusing parts of the entire confusing USB-C ecosystem, and it appears Apple is using MagSafe as a way around it — the power adapters are still interchangeable, but you’ll definitely know if your cable supports fast charging because there’s a MagSafe connector on it. It’s smart, but after years of USB-C nonsense, it’s also just funny we’re back here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWDKt8"&gt;Lastly, there’s the keyboard, which is blessedly drama-free. Apple finally shed the hapless Touch Bar, added full-height function keys, and restrained itself from trying to reinvent anything else. It feels like every other scissor-switch Apple keyboard I’m used to, which is welcome news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUQkM8NMRqv5OHmXMCuIDgqk24U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965883/akrales_211027_4820_0244.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro’s display can reach up to 1,600 nits of brightness, but that’s localized to only HDR content. The rest of the time, the screen has a more standard 500 nits peak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Alv8cS"&gt;The displays in these new MacBook Pros are also all-new, and they are terrific. In fact, I like looking at these displays far more than I like looking at Apple’s own $5,000 Pro Display XDR. But as with the rest of the new MacBook Pros, there is complexity involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lUiHC"&gt;First, there’s the notch, which houses a 1080p webcam, the camera LED, the TrueTone light sensor, and the ambient light sensor at the top of the display. But to me, rather than thinking of the notch eating into the display, I think of the display getting larger except in that one spot. The MacBook Pro effectively has a 16:10 display with a little extra bit at the top where the menu bar and the notch live. You stop noticing it after just a few minutes, just like you stopped noticing the iPhone notch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ojoHG"&gt;If you hate the notch, there are already free utilities to black out the menu bar and hide it, and you’ll have the exact same display experience as any previous MacBook. So we promise: the notch is not worth overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xev9vn"&gt;That said, it can be a little odd in practice. There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143798251339778"&gt;already videos of weirdo notch bugs&lt;/a&gt;, which feels like what happens with every new iPhone notch — it takes a minute for apps to catch up. We are not too worried about it, overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiIiI9"&gt;Now, would it have gone down easier if Apple had added Face ID to the MacBook Pro? Yes, but at least there’s Touch ID, which is very fast on these machines. Would the notch have gone down easier if the webcam was as good as an iPhone front camera, instead of just, like, pretty good? Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6GA62"&gt;Is it also strange that Apple is leaning into display notches as branding elements on both the MacBook and iPhone, allowing them to be distinctively Apple products without having to put logos anywhere? That seems clearer than ever, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notch on new MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFde5UyfBxFRamE7rmfu9q2Hv5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948752/pesposito_170722_4803_0032.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You stop seeing the notch after a day, just like the iPhone’s notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lqmtO7"&gt;This display is way more interesting than the notch, though. It’s now a Mini LED screen, which means the backlight is composed of ten thousand tiny LEDs, grouped into over 2,500 local dimming zones. That means blacks can get really black on this display — up to a million to one contrast ratio, just like an OLED screen. (When you black out the notch, it’s really black — gone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FC0uX6"&gt;And just as we found with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;Mini LED display on the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, that backlight still has limitations — if you go looking for something called blooming, where there’s a little halo around bright elements on an otherwise black screen, you’ll find it. But you have to go looking for it — in this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYtvehF9-Z8"&gt;YouTube torture test&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the backlight chasing this little square around the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txfHO6"&gt;If you’re watching a movie, you might see a little blooming when the controls come up over black, especially if you’re looking at the display off-axis. We got some questions about whether closed captions would cause blooming when watching a video, and the answer is it’s a non-issue: YouTube captions display over a gray box anyway, and Apple TV and Netflix captions mostly display over the video itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ENLloE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Peak brightness of 1,600 nits is limited to HDR content only; the rest of the screen will peak at 500 nits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xkE17e"&gt;Apple made a big deal about how bright this display can get — it’s an XDR display, just like the Pro Display XDR. And just like the Pro Display XDR, it can reach a peak brightness of 1,600 nits, with a sustained brightness of 1,000 nits. But it’s not quite what you think: the display mostly runs at a max of 500 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbjJTN"&gt;Out of the box, the new MacBook Pros are set to a display profile called Apple XDR Display, which allows it to hit that 1,600-nit peak brightness, but only when viewing HDR content. The rest of the system is the same as every other MacBook Pro and runs at a max of 500 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wA5TuF"&gt;If you have a newer iPhone, you already know what this looks like: you open a photo, and it brightens up. That’s more or less what’s going on with this display: when you have HDR content, it can get a lot brighter and hit that 1,600-nit maximum, but everything else is still SDR, and displays at a maximum of 500 nits. In fact, if you choose the standard Apple Display profile and limit the whole system to 500 nits, you won’t be able to tell the difference until you open an app or play a video that calls for HDR. I asked Apple about this; the company confirmed that the XDR system is content-dependent and designed to run at 500 nits for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3iumm"&gt;The good part is that all of this works really well: HDR video works in every app I tried, including YouTube in Chrome and Safari, and it looks terrifically bright with great colors and saturation. The HDR brightness levels even follow the content around the screen seamlessly, showcasing that Mini LED backlight in action. On a technical level, this display is extremely impressive and way more seamless than any HDR support we’ve seen on the Windows side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHTbzN"&gt;The bad part is that Apple’s marketing is confusing, and functionally this is a 500-nit display that can reach much higher brightness levels with the right content, not a 1,000-nit display, which is what a lot of people are taking away from that spec line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkjqWs"&gt;The upshot of all this is that most Mac users will find this display to be mostly familiar with some meaningful upgrades, but if you’re a Windows person using one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675550/hp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;1,000-nit laptops available in that ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, you shouldn’t expect to sear your eyeballs off with this thing in most situations. We did a quick test working outside and it was fine, but if that specific spec is important to you, you’ll have to go look at one of these in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6x9rwa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ProMotion high refresh rate is only barely perceptible in person&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CZkB35"&gt;The last bit of display nerdery is ProMotion, Apple’s variable refresh rate system that lets the display run at anything from 24 to 120Hz. But I could only just barely see the improvement that 120Hz offers in normal, non-gaming use, and only when really looking. It’s just less obvious when it’s not a touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu3Ydt"&gt;All in all, this display looks great, and a little minor blooming is a fine tradeoff for these black levels. Again, I think this display looks better than Apple’s Pro Display XDR, which has fewer dimming zones, more blooming, and off-axis color and brightness shifts that our team really doesn’t like. This display has none of those issues: it’s bright, accurate even, and generally a pleasure to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zT5Hqe"&gt;Lastly, the speakers on these new MacBook Pros are terrific. The first thing we did with these when we got them was open up a video to check out the new displays, but the first thing we &lt;em&gt;noticed&lt;/em&gt; was that the speakers are so good. They are clear and crisp, with some actual low-end from four woofers, and they get super loud. It’s impressive — and while the 14-inch speakers are really good, the 16-inch models in particular have the best speakers we’ve ever heard on a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ws07o80wpykku6lndDXgqmmuMVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965876/akrales_211027_4820_0151.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thicker and heavier designs for this year’s models are welcome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uYb3Tu"&gt;I’ll just cut to the chase: for content creation and creative work, these are the most powerful laptops we’ve ever tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbp4rW"&gt;The basic M1-family chip design is easy enough to understand, even though it’s a new kind of chip architecture compared to x86, since the fundamental parts are all the same. Apple has three kinds of processor cores — efficiency, performance, and GPU — and all the M1 chips are different combinations of those exact same cores with unified memory between them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRF975"&gt;For example: the 13-inch MacBook Pro we tested last year had a regular M1 with four efficiency cores, four high-performance cores, and eight GPU cores. The M1 Pro and M1 Max change that around a little, with two efficiency cores and up to eight high-performance cores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acqXzi"&gt;The really big difference is in GPUs: the regular M1 has up to an eight-core GPU, while the M1 Pro has up to a 16-core GPU, and the M1 Max is available in 24- and 32-core setups. Again, those GPU cores are the same on all the chips — you just get more of them as you go up the range, along with things like faster memory with higher total limits and additional specialized video encoders. (The M1 Max machines have a little toggle for something called “high power” mode in system settings; Apple told me that simply allows the fan to spin faster for better cooling.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybfdnH"&gt;And… it turns out that adding a bunch of cores and specialized video encoders makes these chips incredibly fast for creative work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18gFET"&gt;The synthetic benchmarks we ran were extremely impressive. The M1 Max got a &lt;em&gt;gigantic &lt;/em&gt;score on PugetBench for Premiere Pro, which tests live playback and export performance at 4K and 8K — beating Nvidia’s RTX 3080 and AMD’s 5900HX. The only computers that even come close are &lt;em&gt;desktops&lt;/em&gt; that use vastly more power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bar graph showing 1,170 result in the PugetBench for Adobe Premiere Pro with the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, 1,072 for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 1,000 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 872 for the Alienware X17 R1, and 538 for the ROG Strix G15 Advantage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V-qZ92lwhSx_fGzXpFviAT2z5jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966211/Bench2___PugetBench_Premiere.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PugetBench for Premiere Pro test results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SqGaWN"&gt;You simply will not find better Adobe Premiere performance from any AMD or Nvidia  laptops on today’s market. This system is generating performance in a tiny laptop chassis that, in the past, we’ve only seen from huge desktop machines with enormous power supplies. And it’s doing that even when it’s &lt;em&gt;unplugged&lt;/em&gt;: when we ran all these benchmarks on battery, we didn’t see a difference in scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB7ncG"&gt;When it comes to Cinebench, as well as Geekbench and other tests that stress the CPU, the M1 Max and the M1 Pro are neck and neck, since they have the same 10-core CPU block. Where the scores start to diverge is on tasks that leverage the GPU, like our export test, PugetBench, Geekbench Compute, and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bar graph showing a 12,368 score in Cinebench R23 multi-core 30-minute loop test for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 12,363 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 12,316 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, 8,500 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro 2019, and 7,729 for the 13-inch MacBook Pro M1." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEh_t4NJk9Q2ftQ3Pnurkt16pXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966216/Bench3___Cinebench_R23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even when running long benchmarks, like this 30-minute Cinebench test, the MacBook Pro’s fans rarely spun up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sZyDpX"&gt;This makes sense, since the M1 Max has the same CPU block as the M1 Pro with more GPU cores and higher memory bandwidth. But it underscores the primary question that should be on your mind if you’re deciding whether to buy the Pro or the Max: how much GPU performance do you need? Things will be the same for an office workload or anything CPU-bound, but the Max has a clear advantage if you have specific GPU-optimized workloads. (You’ll take a battery life hit for those extra GPU cores, though — I’ll come back to that in a bit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zP0j2E"&gt;Of course, synthetic benchmarks only tell part of the story, so to see how well a laptop performs a real-world task, we ran an export of the same five-minute, 33-second 4K video clip in Adobe Premiere Pro. I also gave the machines to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior video director Alix Diaconis to edit and use them for a week to see how they worked for our real video production needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyKmaP"&gt;In that setting, these MacBooks were the fastest laptops we’ve ever seen. The 16-inch with the M1 Max was more than twice as fast as any previous MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bar graph showing a 1 minute 46 second time to export a 5 minute 33 second 4K video from Premiere Pro on the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, 2 minutes 50 seconds for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 2 minutes 51 seconds for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 3 minutes 38 seconds for the Razer Blade 15 Advanced 2021, 5 minutes 28 seconds for the 13-inch MacBook Pro M1, 7 minutes 6 seconds for the Razer Blade 14 2021, and 7 minutes 52 seconds for the 16-inch MacBook Pro 2019." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnLBFYB068GVRlQdKgjyLM4Wl-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966220/Bench1___Premiere_4k_export_test.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro models put up the fastest times in our export test we’ve ever recorded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iMfIAs"&gt;It’s not just the export speeds, either. Here’s what Alix had to say about working with them in Premiere Pro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jV88Kc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Premiere ran smoothly with 4K footage — on both the 14-inch and 16-inch M1 Pro machines, I could play back the timeline at full resolution at 2x speed. But to no surprise, when I added graphics and adjustment layers with color, Premiere started dropping frames. It was minor, but after 20 seconds a frame or two would drop. There was also a short but noticeable lag from hitting the spacebar to the timeline actually playing. It was about one second, as if the computer was thinking before it played. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCYJs0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall, the editing experience was very similar to my regular work machine, a 27-inch iMac from 2019 with an eight-core Intel Core i9, 64GB of RAM, and a Radeon Pro 575x graphics card; the M1 Pro machines were actually choppier during 2x timeline playback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5daH2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the M1 Max with 32 GPU cores, there was no lag between hitting the spacebar and playing, and Premiere ran noticeably smoother than my iMac or the M1 Pro laptops. Scrubbing through the timeline was great — I didn’t notice it drop a frame until 3.5 hours in of editing, which is very impressive. It did slow down with big graphics, though.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3KJBml"&gt;The big caveat about all this performance is that you need software optimized to take advantage of it, and we’re still in the middle of the Apple Silicon transition. For example, Adobe’s software isn’t nearly as optimized as Apple’s. Final Cut Pro is heavily optimized for these chips, and it was &lt;em&gt;over 10 minutes faster&lt;/em&gt; than Premiere Pro exporting a 14-minute 4K clip in ProRes 422.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uytM0s"&gt;Although parts of Adobe’s flagship creative software suite have been partially updated for Apple Silicon — Apple even pre-installed Premiere Pro on our review units — some important apps are not yet updated. This was underlined sharply by an After Effects update that arrived in the middle of our testing, which enabled better multi-core acceleration. After Effects is still an Intel app, which runs in the Rosetta emulation mode on these machines, but the update allowed the app to light up all 10 CPU cores and all 32 GPU cores, cutting export times on our test from 4:29 to… 41 seconds. (It also substantially sped up performance on our Intel-based Mac Pro, which is nice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7h8mvN"&gt;That kind of performance increase is worth real money — it’s the kind of thing that lets our team &lt;em&gt;do more than they could with other machines&lt;/em&gt; because they aren’t spending so much time waiting around for things to export. And as we’ve seen, Adobe’s software isn’t even as heavily optimized as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Liv54d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The performance increase is the kind of thing that lets our team do more than they could before, simply because of how much time is saved&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kf1wTV"&gt;In short: the performance improvements on unoptimized software are notable; on heavily optimized software, they’re incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBbb2A"&gt;There’s another category of apps that haven’t (and may never be) fully optimized to take advantage of Apple’s GPUs: gaming. The M1 Pro and the M1 Max are groundbreaking chips, but they’re also built to do creative work really, really well — they haven’t made the MacBook Pros into serious gaming laptops. We ran the &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; benchmark on the three units we have at its highest settings at 1920 x 1200. The M1 Max averaged 84fps on that benchmark, which is good, but it’s also the exact score we got from the Zephyrus G14 with an RTX 3060 chip, so it’s not beating Nvidia’s top guns. We’ve also seen much better from AMD’s GPUs: the Strix G15 with AMD’s RX 6800M averaged 94fps on this game. You could buy two Zephyrus G14s or two Strix G15s for the price of our M1 Max model and have a lot of money left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6dY8v"&gt;(The two M1 Pro machines did way worse here: they both averaged 46fps on the &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; benchmark, which is way closer to the 2019 Intel MacBook Pro than it is to the M1 Max.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdb8vQ"&gt;So: don’t buy these for gaming. They’re not gaming laptops; most games aren’t optimized for them. Buy something else if you want to play games. But if you want to get a lot of creative work done quickly, there’s nothing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new MagSafe 3 cable plugged in to the new MacBook Pro 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xiSYPHj2vPjMlJSLj8_grXyEjVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965873/akrales_211027_4820_0099.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battery life on the new MacBook Pro 16 with the M1 Pro chip is as impressive as its raw performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="genDxM"&gt;All that performance is excellent, but here’s what’s really impressive: the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro ran for 16 hours on its battery during continuous use, making it the longest-lasting laptop we’ve ever tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KupG42"&gt;To test battery life, we just use the machines during the work day, without plugging in, and without letting the display go to sleep. So that 16 hours involved jumping between a dozen-ish Chrome tabs, using apps like Slack and Spotify, and often running Zoom calls and YouTube videos over that. At one point we were worried we’d fall asleep before the MacBook Pro did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lvFoVy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is a noticeable difference in battery life between models with the M1 Pro and those with the M1 Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Za9COQ"&gt;The other two MacBook Pro models didn’t last quite this long in similar testing — but their results are still exceptional. The 14-inch model with the M1 Pro lasted just over 10 and a half hours during normal use, and the 16-inch M1 Max model ran for just over 10 hours. A lot of you asked about battery life with an external display plugged in; when I worked for a day with the TV I use for Zoom intermittently plugged into the HDMI port on that M1 Max machine, battery life fell to seven hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SQi6R"&gt;These results make sense when you look at what’s inside these devices: the two 16-inch models both have a 100-watt-hour battery, which is the biggest laptop battery you’re allowed to bring on an airplane, while the 14-incher has a smaller 70-watt-hour battery. But the M1 Max has a whole bunch of extra GPU cores to power, and that drains the battery faster. I asked Apple, and the company confirmed the M1 Max uses more power both when idle and when active, but it noted that the M1 Max might potentially be more efficient if you run specific multi-core GPU workloads all day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0yrvb"&gt;A lot of you asked whether the extra money for the M1 Max is worth it, and after all that, we think the answer is: no, not for most people. Carrying around all those extra GPUs has an impact on battery life whether you’re using them or not. Unless you can identify a specific part of your workflow that would benefit from serious multithreaded GPU acceleration, the reality is that you’re probably not going to use them. I recommend really thinking about whether the battery penalty of the M1 Max is worth it for what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back of a space gray MacBook Pro 14 next to the back of a silver MacBook Pro 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RwX_yBFt_XM0QGWyiIzPoHAS5jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965898/akrales_211028_4820_0563.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can still get the MacBook Pro models in either dark gray or silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gKO1yJ"&gt;So: those are the new MacBook Pros. They are some of the best laptops we have ever tested, with an unbeatable combination of lightning fast performance and tremendous battery life. And Apple seems to have come back to reality in terms of design — well, apart from that notch. But adding some useful ports and ditching the Touch Bar are just smart, practical choices, and honestly worth the upgrade for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="enovCL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no denying how expensive these computers are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="46bUyK"&gt;So what are the knocks? The biggest one is that these machines are expensive. If you’re an actual pro, the prices are perhaps easy to justify given the performance, but if you’re just doing everyday productivity work, you can get a lot of great laptops for less than the $2,000 starting price of the 14-inch MacBook Pro. And Apple only putting 16GB of RAM in the base models and charging $400 for an upgrade to 32GB is just ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnFzWT"&gt;The other is that Apple is still in the midst of the transition to its own chips, and the software ecosystem isn’t totally there. These machines feel like the future, but parts of that future are still a little bit hazy. Will Apple’s GPU ideas get fully supported by app developers? We’ve been asking that question for a while, and we still don’t know the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6UaXGa"&gt;But all that said: the new MacBook Pros are excellent. And we’ve all hopefully learned an important lesson about ports and buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="K2IaY8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10834312"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest iPad Pro and Pencil are cheaper than ever today</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can pick up the second-gen Apple Pencil today at Verizon for $100 instead of $130.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nVibj5"&gt;The latest 11-inch iPad Pro with an M1 processor is more affordable than ever before today at Amazon. The retail giant is currently selling the Wi-Fi version with 1TB &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0931Z3CWQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $1,299&lt;/a&gt; (the space gray color sadly costs $1,429). As noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we loved the 2021 iPad Pro’s blazing-fast M1 processor, its smaller form factor, and Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks you in the frame while on video calls to keep you centered. It compensates for the fact that Apple still puts its selfie cam at the top of the tablet instead of along its side bezel. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zbbu8i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833256"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VZYmYc"&gt;If you want a capable stylus that’s compatible with the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;, you can find the second-gen Apple Pencil for $100 instead of $130 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Pencil-2nd-Generation%2F949679706" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?sid=VergeDailyDeals102821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-ipad-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, matching its record low price. Unlike the original model, the second-generation version features gesture controls and can wirelessly charge when magnetically attached to the side of your iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMWek1"&gt;Be aware, however, that the new Apple Pencil does not work with the newest entry-level iPad that costs $329. If you want one that is compatible with the iPad, consider picking up the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11365093?sid=VergeDailyDeals10282021Second&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-pencil-for-ipad-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-generation stylus&lt;/a&gt;, which Verizon is currently selling for $80 instead of $100. Note that to charge the original model, you’ll need to plug it into the iPad’s Lightning connector — a design that remains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse"&gt;cringe-worthy&lt;/a&gt; to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1aUma8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gLVQui"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10832871"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="TIasGP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Apple Pencil 2 has gesture controls and charges wirelessly from the iPad Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18023772/new-apple-pencil-2-2018-ipad-stylus-price-release-date"},{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WFPMDk"&gt;Our pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users are selling at an all-time low today on Amazon. Typically $400, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; for just $250, a 37 percent discount. As we wrote in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port for charging, and they fold up in a compact manner. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X3iAJD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OsnZKa"&gt;We’ve got another great deal for non-Apple users, this time on a touchscreen laptop. In her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, my colleague Monica Chin called the latest Surface Laptop 4 “a pretty damn good buy” in comparison to other 15-inch laptops, praising its performance, excellent battery life, and tall 3:2 aspect ratio display that lets you see more on-screen at once. What makes it an even better value is that you can currently purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YX1WLVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;15-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; for its lowest price to date. Typically $2,400, Amazon is selling the matte black-colored model with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of fast PCIe storage, and Intel’s 11th Gen Core i7 processor for $2,250, a cool $150 off the list price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WRAjBo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10832863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgjekP"&gt;If you don’t have room in your home or your budget for a large-screened OLED, a couple of retailers are now selling the 48-inch version of LG’s C1 OLED at a record low. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1176910/2092?subId1=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-48-34-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-hdr-tv-oled48c1%2F-%2FA-82219816"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; are offering the 48-inch LG C1 for $1,097 and $1,100, respectively, down from $1,297. This model has all of the same perks as larger C1 models, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR support, and HDMI 2.1 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wO6emr"&gt;If you do want something bigger, the larger models are still discounted, too, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/10/28/22748849/apple-airpods-pro-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-lg-c1-oled-roku-streaming-stick-deal-sale"&gt;as we wrote about previously&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also offering a six-month subscription to HBO Max when you buy the 55-inch and 65-inch versions of the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch is selling for $1,797&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,500, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is $1,297&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0aERus"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X7wtDQ"&gt;If you’re into gaming, Eneba is currently offering &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states%2Fgamepilot%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year of PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; service for just $37 (the price can fluctuate just a bit) instead of its typical $60 retail price when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;365DAYS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. The popular gaming subscription offers access to a range of perks, including exclusive discounts, access to online multiplayer, and complimentary games every month. PlayStation 5 users will get instant access to the PlayStation Plus Collection, which lets you play &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, and other blockbuster PlayStation 4 titles without paying an additional fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vqT0Dp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NuIuo0"&gt;If you’ve got an Xbox, you might be interested to hear that Eneba’s selling a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global%2Fbest-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDailyDeals10282021&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global%2Fbest-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;for $28 (once again, the price can fluctuate) instead of its usual $45 when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;90DAYS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. Like the aforementioned PlayStation Plus deal, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate gives Xbox owners access to online multiplayer and exclusive deals, as well as many EA Play tiles and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, which is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;widely available on PC, Android, and iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the biggest perk of Game Pass Ultimate is that it lets you access more than 100 Xbox titles for a flat, monthly fee, including &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;finally launches on December 8th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O10eLP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833343"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="D23eso"&gt;More great deals happening now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="title"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KXQX3S3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SanDisk’s 128GB microSDXC card is $22&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon right now, the second-best price we’ve seen on the Nintendo-licensed storage solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kasHm2"&gt;Normally $379, Bose is currently offering a refurbished pair of the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones_outlet/noise-cancelling-headphones-700-fr.html#v=noise_cancelling_headphones_700_fr_black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 for $279&lt;/a&gt;. They may exhibit a few minor scuffs and blemishes given their refurbished condition, but the excellent headphones come with a one-year warranty and a 90-day, risk-free trial. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zD22WC"&gt;If you’re looking to expand the storage capacity of your PlayStation 5, the 1TB version of Gigabyte’s Aorus NVMe Gen 4 SSD is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-PCI-Express-Interface-Performance-GP-ASM2NE6200TTTD/dp/B07TJWZGL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $170 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date. We haven’t tested it, but the &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Solid-State-Drive/AORUS-NVMe-Gen4-SSD-1TB/sp#sp"&gt;company says&lt;/a&gt; it’s compatible with Sony’s next-gen console and runs at 5,600MB/s when plugged in. If you already have an SSD but still need a compatible heatsink, per Sony’s requirements, Micro Connectors Low Profile Heatsink is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Micro-Connectors-Low-Profile-Cooling-NGFFM2-HS804-BK/dp/B07GNJQ37N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $10&lt;/a&gt; and measures a mere 5mm thick. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full PS5 SSD buying guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UELHxn"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTerCoehCu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack of Philips Hue white and color A19 bulbs&lt;/a&gt; is $100 at Best Buy, the lowest price we’ve on the popular smart bulbs outside of Amazon Prime Day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vPNfZD"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTeSj2KlG0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Best Buy for $1,000&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date, for a limited time. Despite the price, the budget-friendly OLED still manages to pack in a few features suited for next-gen gaming, namely support for HDMI 2.1. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L0tKTi"&gt;A three-pack of Eero 6 dual-band Wi-Fi mesh router and extenders is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/treasuretruck" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just $181 today on Amazon’s Treasure Truck&lt;/a&gt;. This is not the lowest price ever on Eero’s popular Wi-Fi 6-equipped mesh system, but it is lower than the usual deal price we see around $220 and much lower than the standard $279 retail price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Apple lost $6 billion to chip shortage and manufacturing delays in Q4, Tim Cook says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rva65arZ-PiIObusakoSD4ivn0Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059433/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bP2687"&gt;Apple today posted strong earnings for its &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/"&gt;fourth fiscal 2021 quarter&lt;/a&gt;, reporting all-time highs for its services and Mac divisions. The company says it took in revenue of $83.4 billion, a year-over-year increase of 29 percent, and earnings per share of $1.24. That earnings number came in below Wall Street expectations of $84.85 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbzuCz"&gt;CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/apple-aapl-q4-2021-earnings.html"&gt;told CNBC&lt;/a&gt; that supply chain constraints had a clear impact on financial results this quarter. “We had a very strong performance despite larger than expected supply constraints, which we estimate to be around $6 billion,” Cook said, attributing the supply issues to “the industry-wide chip shortages that have been talked about a lot and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia.” Apple expects an even greater loss from supply chain issues in the December quarter, it said during Thursday’s earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKp8XU"&gt;The company is fresh off the launch of several new products, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad mini&lt;/a&gt;, ninth-gen iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently, the eagerly anticipated MacBook Pro powered by Apple silicon. The latest iPhones weren’t released until late in the quarter, but the iPhone business as a whole continued to show strong momentum and was up 47 percent over a year ago. The iPad was also up 21 percent over the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQpqjy"&gt;Like other large tech companies, and as Cook made clear, Apple is dealing with major supply chain challenges: the high-end iPhones remain difficult to find in stock at Apple retail locations, and its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are already severely backordered. If you don’t want to deal with long shipping delays, the best option is routinely checking stock at local Apple stores. But even that’s not a guaranteed strategy, and the reality is that buying Apple’s latest gadgets is more difficult than in years past.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dropbox clarifies that a native Apple Silicon app is coming in 2022 after forum outrage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5FJSImoVKSscJ0gK7033q8W0Nkk=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70058892/dropbox_logo_2x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Pdh3z"&gt;Dropbox will finally be updating its Mac app to natively support Apple Silicon sometime in the first half of 2022, the company confirmed today. A previous forum thread saw Dropbox staffers claim that a native app would require “a bit more support before we share your suggestion with our team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MAXIF"&gt;The months-old thread was resurfaced in a post by developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1453394500848537605?s=20"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/dropbox-no-plans-to-support-apple-silicon/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), sparking complaints from Dropbox users who were disappointed by the impression that the company would only develop the app if enough customers asked for it. While Dropbox technically does work with Apple Silicon hardware thanks to Apple’s Rosetta 2 software translation layer, it’s not as power or memory efficient as it could be if it ran natively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27WhBd"&gt;In response to the confusion, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/1453762478479843332"&gt;Dropbox’s CEO Drew Houston&lt;/a&gt; clarified that the service is “certainly supporting Apple Silicon” and that it’s been “working for a while on a native M1 build which we aim to release in H1 2022.” Houston also apologized for the support thread responses, which he called “not ideal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're certainly supporting Apple Silicon, sorry for the confusion. We've been working for a while on a native M1 build which we aim to release in H1 2022. (And agree the responses in the support thread were not ideal)&lt;/p&gt;— Drew Houston (@drewhouston) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/1453762478479843332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
