    <title>How to back up your iPhone with or without iCloud</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DHLC2SDBvxwcZNqwYAAjGTOV0_w=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69861463/vpavic_4279_20201107_0166.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8J0AP"&gt;Yes, of course you want to back up your iPhone — as we all know, despite phone cases and Gorilla glass and careful engineering, disaster — in the form of cracked displays, lost devices, and three-year-olds who think it’s fun to sit on your latest phone — can happen. When that happens, you want to have all your data backed up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gdx7nE"&gt;The easiest way to go is to back up using iCloud, which is not only simple to set up, but makes it just as simple to set up a new phone if your old one is no longer available. (You can also back up to other services, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7070690?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;amp;oco=1"&gt;such as Google Drive&lt;/a&gt;, but it isn’t nearly as convenient.) Or, if you’re an iPhone user who is steadfast about retaining your privacy, you can back up your iPhone to your Mac or Windows computer and retain full control of your data backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkrsTe"&gt;Here’s how to back up to iCloud or your laptop / desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A5xQq7"&gt;Back up to iCloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ntzmom"&gt;Tap on “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “iCloud” &amp;gt; “iCloud Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEEtWS"&gt;If “iCloud Backup” is switched off, toggle it on. If it’s already toggled on, and you’re preparing to wipe your old iPhone, you may want to tap “Back Up Now” just in case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="42Vj94"&gt;Back up to your desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="q4yNJb"&gt;Connect your phone to your computer using its charging cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u98X3q"&gt;Fire up iTunes if you’re using Windows or a Mac with macOS 10.14 or earlier; use Finder on a Mac with macOS 10.15 Catalina or later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3WFTtc"&gt;If you’re using Finder, open a Finder window (by either clicking on the Finder icon in your dock or selecting “File” &amp;gt; “New Finder Window” in the top Finder menu bar), and look for your iPhone in the left-hand menu under “Locations.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Using Finder to change your backup from iCloud to local." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LpyaCLgWzhHg1Cg0vAR6lPXwdcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850810/Back_up_local.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Finder to change your backup from iCloud to local.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="xESSHN"&gt;In iTunes, you should see a small iPhone icon in the upper left corner; select that. (If you don’t see it, you may need to authorize your system. Go to the top iTunes menu and select “Account” &amp;gt; “Authorizations” &amp;gt; “Authorize This Computer...” and follow the instructions.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Look for the phone icon in iTunes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fcX3T0mVGOd03AoSRAhP_2hssk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19621952/capture1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look for the phone icon in iTunes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vbihSr"&gt;After that, the process for either iTunes or Finder is much the same, although the look of the pages and the language will be slightly different. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0HcxIe"&gt;If this is the first time you’ve done this, when you click on the phone icon, you may be asked if you trust the phone, first on the computer and then on the phone itself. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tqi2Ff"&gt;First-timers may also be asked if you want to set your phone up as a new device or restore it from a previous backup. In this case, select the first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ybT9kA"&gt;Select the “General” tab on top and look for the category labeled “Backups.” Select “This computer” (in iTunes) or “Back up all of the data on your iPhone to your Mac” (in Finder).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Using Finder to set up a computer to back up your iPhone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kp08AHvo-OgefDCZ_jy2siRvFIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850821/Back_up_local.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Finder to set up a computer to back up your iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xjJWQH"&gt;You’re going to want to encrypt your backup for increased security. Check “Encrypt iPhone backup” (in iTunes) or “Encrypt local backup” (in Finder) and enter a password. Don’t lose that password; otherwise, you’re going to lose access to your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mtduMI"&gt;Once you set the encryption, it’s probable that the backup will start automatically. Otherwise, click on “Back Up Now.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Using iTunes to change your backup from iCloud to this computer." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J76ttAeeprB_WZmEnsd5gLGU9dk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19621934/iTunes_Windows.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using iTunes to change your backup from iCloud to this computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hk5PlL"&gt;If you need to restore your backup, just go to the same page and click on “Restore Backup...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qz2x43"&gt;Note that you can either manually back up your iPhone, or you can also have it automatically back up each time you connect it to your computer. Look for “Options” just below the “Backups” section, and select “Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="370tiP"&gt;Once you’ve set up your backup to your computer, you may want to delete any backups you’ve made to iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z75WN1"&gt;To do this on your Mac:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Y0Mds6"&gt;Click on the Apple icon in the top corner of your system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2wU71T"&gt;Select “System Preferences” &amp;gt; “Internet Accounts” &amp;gt; “iCloud.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hvB7wJ"&gt;Select the “Manage” button in the lower right corner of the window and then “Backups.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select a backup to delete, then click on the minus icon in the lower left of the window." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5j7evsFvwBbuG9w7LiVf-JpKlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850826/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_3.55.51_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select a backup to delete, then click on the minus icon in the lower left of the window.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="SUpXNX"&gt;Select a backup to delete, click on the minus icon in the lower left of the window, and select “Delete.” This will both delete all your backups from iCloud and turn off any further backups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FospSP"&gt;To do this on your iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bDxoDC"&gt;Go to “Settings” and tap your name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jbDLWm"&gt;Select “iCloud” &amp;gt; “Manage Storage” &amp;gt; “Backups.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tj4rsn"&gt;Tap on “Delete Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M2aeNF"&gt;Tap on “Turn Off &amp;amp; Delete.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “iCloud” &amp;amp;gt; “Manage Storage” &amp;amp;gt; “Backups” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ILLxho3N5d4ocmoWvDekekk0lqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850828/delete_iphone_icloud_backup.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “iCloud” &amp;gt; “Manage Storage” &amp;gt; “Backups” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on “Turn Off &amp;amp;amp; Delete” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ab6HvEBrTkkNFD5cvNlaxbQ8Z00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850830/delete_iphone_icloud_backup2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on “Turn Off &amp;amp; Delete” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to move all your data to your new iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7wBVftLLpYG13H9yLx0WkeJBIU=/0x131:1960x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69861410/Apple_iPhone_13_Pro_Colors_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ynDHQ5"&gt;If you’ve just upgraded — or are planning to upgrade — to Apple’s new iPhone 13, congratulations! You’re going to want to try out your snazzy new phone as soon as you open that box. But first, you need to get all of the apps and data from your old iPhone onto your new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXiQdD"&gt;It’s actually very easy — in fact, if you haven’t upgraded for a while, you’ll find it easier than ever. The process of moving your data used to require restoring it from an iCloud or iTunes backup. Now, you don’t have to bother with that backup (although backing up your stuff is always a good idea). You can move your apps, data, and ID over to the new phone directly with what Apple calls iPhone migration. (However, if you prefer, you can still restore it from iCloud.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig4Hth"&gt;Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qLf7qh"&gt;First, back up your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ffuR80"&gt;No matter how you decide to move your data, it’s a good idea to have a current backup of all of your data saved on iCloud, your laptop, or any other local / cloud storage. Backing up your phone on iCloud Backup is probably the easiest. If it’s been a while and you want to make sure backup is switched on in your phone’s iCloud settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ntzmom"&gt;Tap on “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “iCloud” &amp;gt; “iCloud Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEEtWS"&gt;If “iCloud Backup” is switched off, toggle it on. If it’s already toggled on, and you’re preparing to wipe your old iPhone, you may want to tap “Back Up Now” just in case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nGLcQ1"&gt;You can also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-up-iphone-iph3ecf67d29/ios"&gt;back up your iPhone to a computer&lt;/a&gt;: either to your Mac by using your Finder (if your Mac is using a macOS version before 10.15, you’ll use iTunes) or to a Windows PC (again, using iTunes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol0mKl"&gt;Before you start, there are a couple more things you need to do first: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9XDgnJ"&gt;If your older phone is paired to an Apple Watch, unpair it. (Your data will be moved to the new phone.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q0hmI9"&gt;Transfer your SIM to your new phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TPzkbG"&gt;Okay, now that your backup is done and everything else is ready, let’s move your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QqsLLV"&gt;From a direct wireless connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="aCssOZ"&gt;This phone-to-phone transfer is called Quick Start, for obvious reasons. Start up your new phone. You’ll have the option to enter your Apple ID; otherwise, you’ll be asked a couple of initial questions (such as what language you want to use) and then you’ll be invited to transfer data from another phone, if you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ksjxup"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A wireless phone-to-phone transfer is called Quick Start, for obvious reasons&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g9Prxj"&gt;Put your old phone near your new one. Make sure both phones are plugged in to power (you don’t want them running out of battery in the middle of the data move).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bSrqXK"&gt;When the connection is made, your new iPhone screen will display an animation and your old phone will open its camera and display a blank circle in the middle of the screen. You’ll be asked to hold your new iPhone up to the camera of your old one so that the animation is centered in the circle. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rQ4qle"&gt;You’ll then be invited to move your attention to your new phone to finish the setup. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LFf7eL"&gt;Enter your passcode and Apple ID when asked; you may also be asked whether you want to setup Face ID or Touch ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vJ0xID"&gt;There will be several screens to go through before the transfer begins, including the usual terms and conditions, whether you want to share your location and your analytics, and whether you want to set up FaceTime, iMessage, and Siri. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iv6IC8"&gt;You will also get the choice of moving your data from your previous phone, or from your iCloud backup. If you’ve backed up onto your computer, you can find that under “Other Options.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ayUL14"&gt;Once you’ve made all your choices, the transfer will begin. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y06nu4"&gt;Sign in to your new iPhone again and you’re done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LeCQxF"&gt;From a direct wired connection between phones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TVMcpR"&gt;One advantage of Apple’s updated migration feature is that you can also use a cable to transfer the data. If you’re having any trouble with the wireless transfer, this could be a good alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jmh4Ng"&gt;For a wired connection, you’ll need a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Lightning-USB3-Camera-Adapter/dp/B01F7KJDIM/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lightning to USB 3 camera adapter&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MQUE2AM-A-Lightning-Cable/dp/B07CPS16L4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lightning to USB cable&lt;/a&gt;. And a word of advice: make sure both phones are fully charged before you start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6dWjSJ"&gt;As with the wireless method, start up your new phone and go through the initial questions until you get the invite to transfer data from another phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LS9Rno"&gt;As before, put your old phone near your new one and make sure both phones are plugged in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U5Nai0"&gt;Connect the Lightning to USB 3 camera adapter to your old phone. Connect the Lightning to USB cable to your new phone. Join the two cables together using the adapter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9FlKrN"&gt;After that, follow the same directions as above, including using the camera to find the pattern and answering all the setup questions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hXZQUW"&gt;You’ll know that the phones are using the wired setup because once the transfer starts, there will be a small “cable” between the two phone icons on the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can restore a phone’s data if you’ve backed it up on your computer." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nL6rDNJaKSRRIzixvGIq2d9Eak0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850986/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_3.48.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can restore a phone’s data if you’ve backed it up on your computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LdnbBc"&gt;From a direct wired connection with a Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GzxVtp"&gt;If you’ve backed up your iPhone to a Mac, you can download your data from there to the new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="q4yNJb"&gt;Connect your phone to your computer using its charging cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u98X3q"&gt;Fire up Finder, and select your phone in the left-hand column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0HcxIe"&gt;You may be asked if you trust the phone, first on the computer and then on the phone itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tqi2Ff"&gt;You’ll then be asked if you want to set your phone up as a new device or restore it from a previous backup. Select the latter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="A8aPY1"&gt;Whichever method you choose, enjoy your new iPhone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GH9GSw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 15th, 2021, 10:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on September 20th, 2019 and has been updated to account for differences in the OS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Goodbye and good riddance to Apple’s 64GB iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nMRMjEAcBSFHCuSJYwW20BXaJCo=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69861346/lcimg_78e65da1_4e90_4b7e_a300_6bce2342e8ea.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fqkvv"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt; mark the official end of the 64GB iPhone era: the company has effectively doubled the storage capacities for its 2021 models while keeping prices the same, so the new smartphones now start with 128GB of storage with options for 256GB and 512GB. (For those who require more space, the iPhone 13 Pro models offer up to 1TB.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k27fzt"&gt;While 64GB capacities will still stick around on the legacy iPhone 12, iPhone 11, and iPhone SE models, Apple’s newest hardware will come with a minimum of 128GB now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YrAKZ9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 and 13 Mini announced with redesigned camera array and smaller notch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Ldos8e"&gt;To which I say, goodbye and good riddance. This change was long overdue. Just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/29/16928386/smartphone-storage-memory-64gb-2018"&gt;64GB wasn’t enough to cut it in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and the issue has only grown as apps, photos, videos, and games continue to grow in size. Though Apple has offered that capacity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/10/4/2470139/iphone-4s-announced-available-october-14th-starting-at-199"&gt;since 2011&lt;/a&gt; (joining the then-entry-level 16GB and mid-tier 32GB models), it stubbornly stuck around even as Apple started to offer 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB options on its phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3usm13"&gt;If it feels like history’s repeating itself, that might be because we called out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/21/9771972/save-storage-16gb-phone"&gt;the annoyingly small capacity of a 16GB iPhone in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, too — though that time, it only took Apple one year to turn things around with the iPhone 7, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12832254/apple-iphone-7-storage-32gb-base-model-data"&gt;which offered 32GB by default&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NQT1ix"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"64GB phones aren’t big enough for me anymore","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/29/16928386/smartphone-storage-memory-64gb-2018"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="b30KGD"&gt;Apple’s own fine print points out one reason why 64GB wasn’t enough: you weren’t even getting 64GB of usable storage space to begin with, because the company’s preinstalled apps and OS take up between 11GB to 14GB right out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Px6a73"&gt;“Available space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 11GB to 14GB of space (including iOS and preinstalled apps) depending on the model and settings. Preinstalled apps use about 4GB, and you can delete these apps and restore them. Storage capacity subject to change based on software version and may vary by device.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XJR7KW"&gt;That’s one-fifth of your storage space gone, but even the 50GB or so of remaining storage gets eaten up pretty quickly given the size of modern apps and games. As &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/ios-app-size-growth-2021"&gt;SensorTower reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, the top iPhone apps are nearly four times as big as they were five years ago — continuing a &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/ios-app-size-growth"&gt;long-running trend of bigger apps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsSeG8"&gt;Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, for example, takes up nearly 4GB of storage. Apple Arcade’s &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; takes up another 4GB. WhatsApp and iMessage conversations can accumulate quickly, too — a look at my phone shows those taking up 2.7GB and 4GB, respectively. And that’s not even getting into music or videos, which can quickly take up all the free space on your phone if you download a lot of locally stored content from Apple Music, Spotify, or Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FFkOfn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apps, videos, and photos take up more space than ever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eA2OTO"&gt;And of course, there are photos and videos, which can easily take up that full 50GB on its own for prolific photographers, especially when considering the fact that improved iPhone cameras have arrived alongside more demanding photo and video formats. Apple’s ProRAW format, introduced with the iPhone 12 Pro models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;can average around 25MB &lt;em&gt;per picture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/how-shoot-trim-edit-and-share-4k-video-iphone"&gt;4K footage can pile up even faster&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;iMore&lt;/em&gt; notes that 30 seconds of 4K footage at 30fps will take approximately 175MB (or about 85MB using HEVC encoding). Shooting in HDR, as the newer iPhones support, &lt;a href="https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/turn-off-hdr-video-recording-your-iphone-12-12-pro-reduce-file-sizes-increase-compatibility-0346557/"&gt;balloons those file sizes&lt;/a&gt; even more. Apple has defaulted to 1080p video quality for years on the iPhone (which has technically been capable of shooting in 4K since the iPhone 6S), presumably to avoid complaints about running out of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bN5uts"&gt;Because Apple’s doubling your storage while keeping the starting prices the same ($829 for the iPhone 13 and $729 for the 13 Mini) those entry-priced phones are also a better deal than before. Last year, customers looking for the cheapest new iPhone got stuck with 64GB of storage, to the point it almost made more sense to just get a $999 iPhone 12 Pro (which came with 128GB from the start) instead of paying $879 to get that same capacity in the regular iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uOfKf"&gt;Of course, none of this cleanly solves the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; storage problem looming over Apple: the fact that in 2021, it still only offers customers a paltry 5GB of free iCloud storage space (essential for backing up your iPhone), something that Apple enjoys frequently reminding users about with its constant “Out of storage” notes imploring them to shell out for more cloud space. Still, the extra 64GB of internal capacity may help alleviate the issue by letting users store more photos and messages locally on their phones instead of in the cloud, leaving more space for things like device backups in the 5GB that Apple gives you for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVXujo"&gt;Hopefully, though, the change in local storage this year is a prelude of things to come; after all, that 5GB of free iCloud storage was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apps/2011/6/6/2515086/icloud-announced-apple-wwdc"&gt;also introduced a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, in 2011. Surely after 10 years, Apple might be able to find room in its heart (and its budget) for a similar increase of space? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is rolling out a new ‘5G UC’ icon for iPhones to tell when you have real 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/trrIzyhQcMhRtojb8X5MdWnBIQo=/0x19:934x642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860859/Screen_Shot_2021_09_15_at_8.24.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qe3Npq"&gt;5G branding is going to get even more confusing, soon: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1437854783184916481"&gt;T-Mobile has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be rolling out a new “5G UC” icon on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;upcoming iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; lineup to let customers know when they’re connected to T-Mobile’s “5G Ultra Capacity” network, instead of the regular old 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qF9MYF"&gt;The difference here is one of bands and brands: at T-Mobile, an unadorned “5G” icon will soon refer to the company’s low-band network, which it calls “5G Extended Range.” As the name suggests, it’s a slower network (closer to legacy LTE speeds) but it reaches a broader area. From a spectrum perspective, it exists in largely the same areas as LTE but uses 5G technologies and techniques for improved speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gO6qtH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mnPKuN"&gt;A “5G UC” icon, though, will mean that you’re either connected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325857/t-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range"&gt;T-Mobile’s mid-band network&lt;/a&gt; (which it inherited from Sprint as part of the major merger between the two companies) or its high-band mmWave network (branded as “5G Ultra Capacity”) — both of which offer dramatically faster speeds. As &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual 5G speed test&lt;/a&gt; showed this year, that mid-band coverage in particular (hitting the sweet spot of speed increase and range) has been a big contributor toward T-Mobile’s vastly improved network offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="58JHWy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone13?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPhone13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone13Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPhone13Pro&lt;/a&gt; will let &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TMobile&lt;/a&gt; customers know when they are in an area with⚡️  fast speeds with Ultra Capacity 5G!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Just keep an eye out for the below icon.   users will see it more and more as we continue to rapidly roll out this   spectrum combo. &lt;a href="https://t.co/EirfCk8pjl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EirfCk8pjl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Neville (@NevilleRay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1437854783184916481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p4LJqy"&gt;And while yet another 5G brand standard is confusing, it’s not without precedent. Verizon has been differentiating between its low-band 5G (also called “5G”) and its mmWave coverage (“5G UW,” or ultra-wideband) since it started rolling out those networks years ago. AT&amp;amp;T does something similar, too, referring to low-band 5G as “5G,” while its mmWave networks are “5G Plus.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="240QJO"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also has the unfortunate tendency to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;misleadingly refer to its LTE networks as “5G E,”&lt;/a&gt; which, unlike the other flavors of 5G on this list, is not actually 5G at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj1rXT"&gt;But T-Mobile’s change is arguably a necessary one: the rush to sell customers on 5G and slap the next-generation networking’s branding everywhere has meant that the low-band networks most people currently experience as “5G” is actually fairly similar — practically speaking — to LTE. But now that carriers are actually rolling out the bigger improvements that do bring meaningful speed and latency increases, they’re caught in a problem of their own devising: regular “5G” is too diluted of a brand to make an impact, hence the more bombastic ultras and pluses being appended to icons and logos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39Qhap"&gt;The new 5G UC icons should start rolling out soon on the iPhone 13 models once they’re released, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/po9aqn/tmobile_to_add_5g_uc_icon_to_iphone_13_when_in/hcvei91/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;last year’s iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it every year, but the iPhone 13 cameras do seem much improved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7u5nyjXL1Lj3DAf27mMr4pPXV8=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860644/i13p2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPEBtq"&gt;Cameras continue to be one of the biggest differentiators in smartphones, and Apple’s iPhone lineup is no different. Apple says the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the company’s “most advanced dual-camera system ever,” while the 13 Pro and Pro Max have “our three most powerful cameras ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dWYGH"&gt;Which you’d hope for, of course. But this year, Apple really does appear to be making a big push with its cameras, particularly with the Pro models. As ever, the question will be what Apple is able to wring out of its hardware with image processing and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQGoWi"&gt;The iPhone 13 lineup represents the first time Apple has increased the primary camera’s sensor size across the board since the iPhone XS and XR in 2018, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21515571/iphone-12-pro-max-camera-quality-features"&gt;last year’s 12 Pro Max had a 47 percent bigger sensor&lt;/a&gt; than the 12 and 12 Pro. Sensor size is a key factor in image quality because, together with lens aperture, it determines how much light the camera is able to capture. More light, less noise and blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tK52o"&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini’s main cameras have bigger sensors, which is part of the reason why it and the ultrawide are now arranged diagonally in the camera bump. Apple also added sensor-shift optical image stabilization, a feature first seen on the 12 Pro Max. It’s not clear exactly how big the 13’s sensor is, but Apple says it’ll capture 47 percent more light than the 12. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEUG2VZhfv8_aShe9BOhPHTybhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852177/i13p.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nyxfXN"&gt;The 13 Pro and Pro Max have a even bigger primary sensor and slightly faster f/1.5 lens that capture 2.2 times as much light as before, according to Apple. Again, the exact sensor size hasn’t been advertised, but Apple did give the pixel size: it’s 1.9μm, which is bigger than any modern smartphone I’m aware of. Apple can do this because the sensor is a relatively low-resolution 12 megapixels, but it’s still an impressive stat that should translate to better low-light performance. For comparison, the 12 Pro Max had 1.7μm pixels, while every other iPhone since the XS has had 1.4μm pixels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="52XSSS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple isn’t outgunning Android phones on hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n2R1t8"&gt;It’s not clear exactly what hardware changes Apple has made to the iPhone 13’s ultrawide camera; the company simply says it has a “faster sensor” that “reveals more detail in the dark areas of your photos.” The Pro does have significant hardware tweaks, though, since Apple has increased the aperture to f/1.8 for a 92-percent improvement in light-gathering capability. The sensor also now has focus pixels on board — things are rarely out of focus in ultrawide shots because the depth of field is so large, but adding autofocus means that the camera can be used for macro photography, with a focusing distance of 2cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Rwrb4"&gt;The telephoto camera remains exclusive to the 13 Pro phones, and Apple has increased its equivalent focal length to 77mm, or three times longer than the primary camera. Previously the iPhone 12 Pro’s telephoto offered 2x zoom while the 12 Pro Max went out to 2.5x. There’s a tradeoff here — if you want to frame something with 2x zoom, the 13 Pro will need to crop in from the main camera, reducing image quality. But your pictures that go beyond 3x zoom will be much sharper than before, and it should make for a better portrait lens. Apple has also added Night mode to the telephoto for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J64QBL"&gt;When compared to the Android competition, Apple isn’t doing much to outgun them on the hardware front. The large 1.9μm pixels are noteworthy, but most Android phone makers have been prioritizing big, high-resolution sensors rather than pure pixel size. Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra, for example, has a huge 50-megapixel sensor with 1.4μm pixels, meaning it has decent light-gathering ability even when shot at native resolution without binning the pixels together. And while the 3x telephoto lens is going to be useful, it’s now common to see 5x periscope telephotos (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21444946/huawei-p40-pro-plus-vs-iphone-pixel-10x-zoom-camera"&gt;or occasionally even 10x&lt;/a&gt;) in the Android world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMDyp54O2X93mx0f_YJVBUgkqvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852176/camera_system__f9pkhq4g2oy2_large_2x.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YYXY1o"&gt;So even though Apple has made meaningful hardware improvements across the iPhone 13 lineup, as ever its performance relative to competitors will come down to how well its software and image processing pipeline has been optimized. The iPhone 11 was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;hugely better camera&lt;/a&gt; than the XS the year before it, after all, even though the hardware &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/11/20860442/apple-iphone-11-camera-analysis-competition"&gt;barely changed&lt;/a&gt;. This year Apple is touting Smart HDR 4, which is capable of individually adjusting exposure for multiple people in the frame, but we’ll have to see the phones for ourselves to know what kind of a difference that makes. The same goes for Photographic Styles, a new filter-like feature that Apple says is smarter about adjusting elements like skin tones and skies in each photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIuJtD"&gt;As for video, Apple is making a big deal out of its Cinematic mode that lets you selectively adjust focus and depth of field when post-processing, like Portrait mode for photos. That’s something we’ll definitely have to test extensively. The 13 Pro, meanwhile, lets you record and edit video in Apple’s ProRes codec on the phone itself, or you can export the ProRes file to Final Cut Pro on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccov7C"&gt;All the usual caveats about waiting for full reviews most certainly still apply, but this is looking like a pretty good year for the iPhone camera. Apple is never going to have the flashiest hardware, but it’s made some welcome improvements in areas that make sense, and thankfully it hasn’t locked any features to the Max-sized iPhone. We’re looking forward to seeing the results — as well as those of looming competitors like the Pixel 6. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where are Apple’s new Macs? Here’s what we’re still expecting Apple to announce this year   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="It uses TouchID for biometrics. Overall the hardware is identical to the last model" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b3eRLzXafQlJF-PIMmYt6XADG7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69859437/vpavic_4291_20201113_0429.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W5nXzy"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;“California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; was packed with announcements, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;sixth-gen iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. We expected much of this, yet, there were a number of things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;we had anticipated&lt;/a&gt; that Apple might announce but didn’t, including new MacBook Pros and next-gen AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvt4P8"&gt;However, it looks like there’s still hope they may make an appearance soon, especially given that October is historically when Apple will showcase new Macs. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s reliable Apple-watcher, Mark Gurman, Apple will likely &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1437140403803672581"&gt;hold at least one more&lt;/a&gt; online event within the next “several weeks,” which means Apple may still reveal the no-shows from today before the end of 2021. Here are some of the more noteworthy omissions we expect to see in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cLH8qg"&gt;New MacBook Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jFiS2O"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; powered by a new &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-m1x-vs-m2-chip-what-we-know-so-far-and-what-it-means-for-new-macbooks"&gt;M1X chip&lt;/a&gt; — the rumored name for an enhanced variant of Apple’s M1 chip that made its debut last year — could make an appearance as early as next month, Gurman predicts. Rumor has it the new laptops will reportedly feature a flat-edged redesign and the return of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;magnetic MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the reintroduction of previously excised inputs like the HDMI port and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244398/apple-2021-macbook-pro-sd-card-slot-report-ports-refresh"&gt;SD card slot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7vfx8O"&gt;New Mac Minis, iMacs, and Mac Pro workstations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NkHzJz"&gt;After Apple unveils the MacBook Pro, Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;also speculates&lt;/a&gt; we may see an upgraded Mac Mini, a bigger iMac, an updated Mac Pro workstation, and even a “new low-end MacBook Pro.” Each machine will also be reportedly powered by the next generation of Apple’s in-house chips, which will “will greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,” according to Gurman’s anonymous sources. Still, there’s no guarantee Apple will unveil these before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blmZS4"&gt;Next-gen AirPods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XYABES"&gt;It was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/12/kuo-airpods-3-apple-event-tuesday/"&gt;heavily rumored&lt;/a&gt; that Apple would unveil the third generation of AirPods during its iPhone 13 event, so it was a huge surprise when the company didn’t. It’s possible, however, that we could still see these make their debut before the holiday season starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMWMyT"&gt;When they do arrive, the new AirPods will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;reportedly boast&lt;/a&gt; some of the most significant changes in form since their 2016 debut. It’s likely the new pair will mirror the AirPods Pro in design, with a new case and shorter stems. However, that may be where the similarities between the two end — noise cancellation, for example, may remain exclusive to the Pro model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZjAfT"&gt;The new AirPods are expected to retail anywhere between $150 and $200, and it’s not clear yet whether Apple will sell two different versions — one with and one without a wireless charging case — like it does with the current non-Pro AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j7cEfE"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GyvvHU"&gt;During Tuesday’s keynote, Apple announced that the next iteration of its smartwatch operating system, watchOS 8, will launch alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. macOS users, however, are still in the dark as to when, exactly, they might see the official release of macOS Monterey, the successor to macOS Big Sur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wACDT6"&gt;macOS Monterey — which was first introduced as a free update during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; and has been testing in public beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;since July&lt;/a&gt; — is still presumingly set to arrive in the fall, which what’s listed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22674369%2Fapple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The update brings improvements to FaceTime, Safari, and a slew of other apps. Monterey will also introduce features such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596970/apple-macos-monterey-live-text-intel-processors"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that allows you to control and quickly move files across multiple Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUncrx"&gt;Given the lack of Mac updates during Tuesday’s event, it seems possible that Apple could announce the release date of Monterey during the rumored event in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f0QJze"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the macOS Monterey public beta","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ILfKIWosxYvizGkz0Si0pY9KsZE=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69859316/lcimg_5ab83a83_d836_4e82_b8f5_f6ccdf0eee9f.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 has a larger display, and looks like an Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ajPTaI"&gt;One of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;big rumors heating up&lt;/a&gt; before Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;“California Streaming” iPhone announcement event&lt;/a&gt; about the Apple Watch Series 7 wound up fizzling out as soon as the new smartwatch was unveiled. The speculation was that Apple would perform the most significant overhaul of its smartwatch ever, aligning its design with that of the iPhone 12 and 13 — namely, flat sides and a more squared-off look with a larger display and smaller bezels. We got the larger display and slimmer bezels part, but the Apple Watch Series 7 still mostly looks like its predecessors at casual glance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh7XXc"&gt;The biggest change to the Series 7 is indeed physically bigger: the display. Apple increased the screen sizes to 41mm and 45mm, and with a thicker glass top the display is stronger while stretching out further to the edges. The functional benefit is more room on the screen for larger icons, and Apple says you can do and see more with more info on screen and new watch faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVz5af"&gt;Along with the screen changes, the Series 7 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;a bevy of typical year-over-year improvements&lt;/a&gt;, such as faster charging, improved durability, new workouts, new colors, and even a full swipe keyboard for fidgeting with some tiny letters on these larger screens. But even with all of that, the design feels conservative, and not a radical departure from its immediate forebears. So should you wait until Apple’s estimated “later this fall” timeframe for the Apple Watch Series 7, or do the Apple Watches of today offer enough as-is for you? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yWtSu4UACW7kFWvzFlbtzN6QQ84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850224/lcimg_d5b7c216_a765_44c8_94ea_3a59eb0563f3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7’s colors, including a green that seems vaguely black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="alRuHC"&gt;The outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; of 2020 is still an impressively capable smartwatch, and we’ve seen significant discounts on it for months now. The polarizing red colorway has at times plummeted as low as $249, even cheaper than the midrange $279 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; that lacks an always-on display. Right at this moment you can buy a Series 6 from a variety of retailers in a color of your choice for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=verge091421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$319&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$349&lt;/a&gt;, which is a considerable amount less than the $399 starting price of the Series 7 without having to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWFRQe"&gt;Spending less right now becomes even more appealing when you consider the Series 7 may still be using last year’s S6 processor — if so, it probably won’t have an added year of OS updates over the Series 6 like you’d normally expect. One of the benefits of a new processor isn’t just the speedy improvements of today, but also the sustainability and reassurance offered down the road by an increased performance ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CvAQ2a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zhG-_eAoGQRSxsbWZoY6BmO67w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850995/applewatch_series7_typing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please don’t lie and tell me you look forward to typing on this screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5zlmpZ"&gt;The Series 7 certainly has its merits. If you prefer to have the most peace of mind, or you live a lifestyle that will really put a fitness-focused device to the test, then perhaps the new IP6X resistance rating for grittier environments and sandy beaches is enticing. If you value the fastest charging, the Series 7 comes with a USB-C magnetic fast charger, offering a 33 percent quicker charge, and even buying one of those separately will not juice up a prior generation watch any quicker. The larger displays are of course the biggest change, and if you always prefer what’s newer, bigger, and flashier then by all means keep an eye out for when preorders go up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRniGK"&gt;But this new Apple Watch still pretty much just looks like any old Apple Watch, especially at the distances people usually see a watch on someone’s wrist. What will matter most to you here might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652375/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-phones-fashion"&gt;a very personal tech or fashion accessory decision&lt;/a&gt;, and if a slightly larger screen is all you need maybe that’s good enough. Though if you’re looking for the most sensible smartwatch from Apple, you may want to consider skipping the wait and choosing from the more cost-effective options available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyQVP6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the iPhone 13, Mini, Pro and Max compare to Android rivals — and vs. iPhone 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIE1fKsyU-4YGO8QCzzk9vf437c=/136x0:1525x926/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858872/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.41.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OwYW5M"&gt;Apple has announced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, which feature better cameras, 120Hz screens, new processors (which Apple claims are the fastest in a phone, period), better battery life, and smaller notches compared to their predecessors. But should you upgrade from the iPhone 12, and is Apple beating the Android competition? Here’s how Apple stacks up to Samsung, OnePlus, Google, and its own previous devices on paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEx3AS"&gt;One thing to keep in mind before we dive in is that specs don’t tell the whole story. There’s the obvious difficult comparisons (how does an Apple A15 chip stack up against a Snapdragon 888, and how do you compare traditional phones to folding ones), as well as the small details that don’t fit cleanly on a spec sheet. For instance, one of Apple’s pro features is the ability to shoot 4K ProRes on its higher-end phones — except for the models with 128GB of storage, which will be limited to 1080p ProRes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kLycRm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Missing from this comparison: Google’s upcoming flagships&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLNb0o"&gt;There’s also an obvious competitor missing: Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google didn’t give us their full specifications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;in its partial announcement&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it hard to include them in a spec comparison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdkPRY"&gt;But let’s put all those caveats aside, because maybe you’re looking for a phone &lt;em&gt;right now. &lt;/em&gt;How do the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini stack up, spec-for-spec, against their Android competitors? Prices throughout this comparison, by the way, are for the unlocked iPhones, which are $30 more than the carrier versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEaQyh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10752933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U16Rcu"&gt;Anyways, let’s stop talking about saving a few bucks, and blow the budget a bit: how does the iPhone 13 Pro stack up against the Android flagships, in a battle of the $1,000 plus phones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tbl3mx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10752940"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xtCxJu"&gt;As with past years, we see that Apple isn’t necessarily playing a spec-game, especially when it comes to cameras. Some of its higher-end Android competitors boast megapixel counts that are four or even almost 10 times as high as Apple’s cameras. Whether that’ll give them an edge or not will have to be seen when we test Apple’s “dramatically more powerful” cameras. Both Apple and Google have traditionally prioritized larger pixels for low-light performance rather than raw resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKBjqe"&gt;Finally, let’s take a look at how Apple did year-over-year when it comes to upgrading its specs. It’s worth noting that, while we’ve included the 12 Pro, you actually can’t buy that phone  from Apple anymore, making the comparison more useful for upgraders than cross-shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eKc9TA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10753324"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUkaL0"&gt;One interesting point is that the phones haven’t changed when it comes to width, height, or screen size, but they have gotten a bit thicker, and a bit heavier. They are packing a fair amount of new tech though, so perhaps that’s understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HoaQL"&gt;What the specs don't show, though, is how unfavorably the iPhone 12 is priced — at first glance the it seems like a reasonable buy at $100 cheaper, but at that price you’re only getting half the storage. If you get a 128GB iPhone 12, you’ll only be saving $50 compared to the 128GB iPhone 13, which has all the upgrades to the screens, cameras, battery life, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;everything else Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. Sure, it’s technically less expensive, but you’d be giving up a lot for very little savings. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s updated leather MagSafe wallet supports Find My location tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z5Hcb5ftQ2C0iPfl-S_1-wyLOr8=/0x33:1468x1012/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858738/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.46.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HfglLg"&gt;Apple introduced an updated version of its &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM0Q3ZM/A/iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-golden-brown?fnode=39b68db69449c5a7ec6859579b5af320916609c170ab6488a4d76b5b025119f9e4646c0fcb99801d36758ddc3ecd4b1df121159a3759e017741796dbe5a58353744d6d28bbfdeeb02e47324b9e9820478c80412df67a05bd862cca30516def3b"&gt;MagSafe leather wallet&lt;/a&gt; today with new colors and support for an additional feature: tracking in the Find My app. Apple’s location tracking service recently expanded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;with the addition of AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company is apparently working &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; version of the same functionality into its more low-tech accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykzFme"&gt;That might seem like the continuous tracking AirTags offers, but Apple’s description points to something simpler. The company writes that the wallet “supports Find My, so you can be notified of your wallet’s last known location if it gets separated from your phone.” That’s helpful, but possibly not useful if someone moves your wallet after it’s separated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sPE6m6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It seems like MagSafe is the key &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kNsRxF"&gt;Apple isn’t entirely clear why this is the case on its product page, but it’s possible what’s really happening is your iPhone is just noting when the MagSafe magnet is or isn’t attached to your phone. Your iPhone already plays a small animation when you attach a MagSafe product, it wouldn’t be too hard to imagine it marking a GPS location in Find My when a MagSafe accessory is disconnected. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UOweLsE59uRpvQ7chtkJ9-JPtNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850831/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.37.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eRG80f"&gt;There’s also an odd exception: in the fine print, Apple notes that the new Find My functionality isn’t supported on the Clear Case with MagSafe. The best guess here is that whatever unique ID your iPhone recognizes when you connect a MagSafe device might be blocked by a Clear Case. Why the Clear Case but not other MagSafe cases would keep Apple from knowing when a wallet is disconnected isn’t clear. That doesn’t make the new wallet less useful necessarily, but it does show it has limitations that a normal wallet with an AirTag or Tile shoved inside wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRoYru"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Apple for an explanation of how the new Find My functionality works, and what exactly is happening with the Clear Case. We’ll update if we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch’s new sizes make shopping for bands more confusing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8X-OzuKkyLOFNcVAUs7mkLrCiDY=/0x0:1653x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858714/applewatchsizes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rOryBA"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; was one of the many announcements made during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the stage alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;iPad Mini with USB-C charging&lt;/a&gt;, and more. The watch comes in new 41mm and 45mm case sizing, moving away from the 40mm and 44mm sizing that has been the standard for the last few generations of Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8STKV"&gt;As expected, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAdlfb73UN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple updated its online inventory of Watch bands&lt;/a&gt; accordingly for the new sizes. But many of them no longer list options for the 38, 40, 42, and 44mm sizing options for all of the bands. While it might appear at first that Apple has unceremoniously eradicated support for all previous models, don’t worry, it didn’t do that. However, the company did make it slightly more confusing to quickly find the accessory made for your watch size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYva4N"&gt;This breakdown should make it easier to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjdNKJ"&gt;If you see a band you like that’s 41mm-sized, this implicitly indicates that they’ll work with 38mm and 40mm cases, too. The 45mm bands will work with Apple Watch models that have 42mm or 44mm cases. To make doubly sure that you’re getting a size that’s compatible with your watch, Apple’s site offers up compatibility details right beneath the sizing options, so be sure to click that if you’re skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple store" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yt9bdtms4NzwG8dbeVNBGGSNvTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850741/bandcompatibility.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This window will appear if you click “See Compatibility Details” from Apple’s online store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OIsmNH"&gt;Shopping for solo loop bands is just a little more complicated, but nothing new there. In case you didn’t know, they’re compatible only with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, the Series 4, and newer models. For 40mm and 41mm-sized Apple Watch models, you can get solo loop bands in the size range of one through nine, whereas the 44mm and 45mm models work with band sizes four through 12. If that sizing reads like gibberish to you, the solo loop requires you to take a measurement of your wrist size to find the size that lines up with Apple’s sizing guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8cTGa"&gt;To reiterate, bands made for the smaller of the two new sizes work with the previous, smaller-sized Apple Watch models, and vice versa. Getting a bigger-sized Apple Watch band basically ensures it’ll work with previous wearables that were the biggest sizing option of their respective generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxqHE7"&gt;I hope this tip helps you find a watch band that fits your watch. While it might be confusing at first, it’s fairly easy to commit to memory once you know about it. &lt;/p&gt;
