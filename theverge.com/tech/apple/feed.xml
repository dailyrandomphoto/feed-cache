    <title>Epic-backed expert says Apple’s app store profit is as high as 78 percent</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hUiI_MPTLosJoewIUa2j5t8SLnw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69219619/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9a9cP"&gt;An expert witness for Epic Games testified that Apple’s App Store had operating margins above 70 percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484513/ned_barnes_testimony.pdf"&gt;new court documents show.&lt;/a&gt;  Ned Barnes testified that information from Apple’s Corporate Financial Planning and Analysis group show the App Store had a 77.8 percent operating margin in 2019, and 74.9 percent in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rPK8V"&gt;The figures are close to Barnes’ calculations of the App Store’s profits, he testified, and “also refute criticisms of my report proffered by certain Apple expert witnesses that it is not possible to calculate reliably or usefully the operating margins of the App Store.” Barnes also testified that Apple has been tracking its App Store profits for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chGe68"&gt;Apple has hotly contested that interpretation of the data. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/apple-s-app-store-had-78-profit-margin-in-2019-testimony-shows?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s chief compliance officer said at a congressional hearing last month that “we don’t have a separate profit and loss statement for the App Store,” and that Cook has made similar statements about the App Store and how it’s structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8YE6T"&gt;An Apple spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday that Barnes’ figures were incorrect: “Epic’s experts calculations of the operating margins for the App Store are simply wrong and we look forward to refuting them in court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7wd8x"&gt;The question of how much profit Apple makes from the app store is at the center of the ongoing court case between Apple and Epic Games. Epic argues that the App Store provides no real service, but simply serves as a way for Apple to extract money from developers. Epic is suing Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;for antitrust violations&lt;/a&gt; on those grounds, after launching an unauthorized in-app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;payments system for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. But Apple insists the App Store review process is a pivotal part of the broader platform safety efforts around iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQsHN3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484567/schmalensee_testimony.pdf"&gt;Court documents show Apple’s expert witness Richard Schmalensee&lt;/a&gt; also disputed Barnes/Epic’s figures. “Mr. Barnes’ estimate of the App Store’s operating margin is unreliable because it looks in isolation at one segment of the iOS ecosystem in a way that artificially boosts the apparent operating margin of that segment,” Schmalensee said in his written direct testimony. “When one looks at Apple’s device and services ecosystem as a whole, the operating margin falls to an unremarkable level.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Un5tXR"&gt;Schmalensee further testified that “it makes no sense” to try to measure the App Store’s profitability in isolation since it’s part of the iOS platform and relies on all of Apple’s intellectual property. “As top Apple executives will testify, Apple does not calculate P&amp;amp;Ls by products and services because they view it as an unproductive exercise,” according to Schmalensee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Iroz"&gt;Court proceedings for the trial are due to begin on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro? You may have to wait until July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhrRuUTDaqBkWS4_drkuoi_XzPU=/312x0:2000x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214967/lcimg_06ebca85_7eac_4c32_9e8f_4b98fad99ec8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g58tOJ"&gt;If you’re hoping to get one of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pros with a Mini LED display, you may be waiting a while — the delivery times for even &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F12.9-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi"&gt;the base model&lt;/a&gt; have slipped to late June or early July (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-30/apple-s-new-high-end-ipad-pros-see-delivery-times-slip-to-july"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Leading up to the device’s announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;there were rumors&lt;/a&gt; that the display tech could be a production bottleneck for Apple, and that appears to be the case — Apple’s site says &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F11-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi"&gt;the 11-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, announced alongside the 12.9-inch, would be delivered in late May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOuBkf"&gt;The Mini LED display that could be to blame for the short supply of iPads is a new tech for Apple, but it promises to bring a ton of improvements compared to normal LED displays. However, they’re trickier to produce — Apple says that the previous iPad Pro’s display had 72 LEDs, while the Mini LED version boasts over 10,000. For a more in-depth look at the tech, we have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;an explainer here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-7-core-gpu-256gb%23"&gt;lower-end iMac&lt;/a&gt; will arrive in late May, though the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-256gb%23"&gt;higher-end versions&lt;/a&gt; won’t get to you until early June — the same as the new Siri Remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Au8nJF"&gt;Interestingly, while &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag%2F1-pack"&gt;a single AirTag&lt;/a&gt; seems readily available, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag%2F4-pack"&gt;the four-pack&lt;/a&gt; is a bit harder to come by — Apple’s site has them delivering in June, while &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirTag-4-Pack/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the pack listed&lt;/a&gt; as out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can save up to $147 on a preorder for the latest M1 iPad Pro or iMac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XuagldWx4arBbKfspjX2DG3qcc0=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69211882/lcimg_06ebca85_7eac_4c32_9e8f_4b98fad99ec8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest iPad Pros are powered by the M1 chip.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F58ugb"&gt;Following the official reveal last week of the new model refreshes for the iMac and iPad Pros, all of which are powered by Apple’s own silicon — the M1 chip — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22409463/apple-m1-imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-4k-preorders-price-release-date"&gt;preorders began for all three products today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DCXL7"&gt;As spotted first by &lt;a href="https://9to5toys.com/2021/04/30/apple-m1-imac-expercom-deals/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9to5macToys+%289to5Mac+Toys%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Toys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Expercom is offering an incentive if you pre-purchase any of the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fnew-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-2021-model%3Fvariant%3D39316140621858#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fnew-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-2021-model%3Fvariant%3D39316140621858#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fimac%2Fproducts%2F24-inch-imac-with-apple-m1-7-core-gpu-blue#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1 products&lt;/a&gt;, with up to $147 in savings available depending on the configuration you select, making this the first time any of these three brand-new products have seen a discount yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daDOJC"&gt;The base &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fimac%2Fproducts%2F24-inch-imac-with-apple-m1-7-core-gpu-blue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1 iMac is available for preorder at Expercom&lt;/a&gt; for as low as $1,233 ($66 off); this configuration includes 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. As noted previously, the configurations vary, but there are price reductions for multiple configurations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4AzLJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474631"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fpeu6S"&gt;The 2021 iPad Pros are the first in Apple’s tablet line to include the M1 processor. The 11-inch iPad Pro is more affordable with a starting price of $799. But Expercom is offering the base model, which includes &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fipad-pro-11-inch-1%3Fvariant%3D39316139212834#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage with Wi-Fi only, for $750&lt;/a&gt; — $49 off its usual starting price. You can also select the option to get more storage or 5G network support, all of which vary in price depending on which configuration you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2nBbHZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VEfgW0"&gt;Along with the 11-inch iPad Pro, the 12.9-inch model also receives a model refresh, which includes the M1 chip. This flagship tablet has a new Liquid Retina XDR Mini LED screen and starts at $1,099 for the base 128GB storage configuration with Wi-Fi only. But you can get this &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fnew-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-2021-model%3Fvariant%3D39316139999266#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;particular model for $1,032 at Expercom&lt;/a&gt; with up to $147 off if you get the highest storage configuration plus Wi-Fi and cellular support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="idquVm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Next week’s Fortnite trial could upend Apple’s App Store model — even if Epic loses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0K83EUzfEK24jFSjGX5fNt-lW_s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69211874/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Epic will put Apple’s business under a microscope&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="G21BQ5"&gt;In August 2020, mega-publisher Epic Games decided to stop paying what’s dubbed the “Apple tax”: a 30 percent fee on digital purchases made through the iOS App Store. The company added a new feature to its blockbuster game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, letting users bypass the App Store’s payment system to purchase V-Bucks, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in-game currency. The move violated Apple’s guidelines, and Apple promptly kicked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store. Epic sued Apple for antitrust violations, and on Monday, the case will finally go to court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZP39"&gt;Epic has a clear grievance against Apple: it’s locked out of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021"&gt;billion-plus iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18202736/apple-devices-ios-earnings-q1-2019"&gt;iPad user base&lt;/a&gt;. But US antitrust law focuses on whether a company has hurt &lt;em&gt;consumers&lt;/em&gt; by suppressing competition. So over the next three weeks, Apple and Epic will lay out sharply conflicting stories about how a locked-down App Store affects users. Unlike a lot of tech trial arguments, which focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21506172/oracle-google-java-supreme-court-hearings-oral-arguments-metaphors-qwerty"&gt;abstract hypotheticals and metaphors&lt;/a&gt;, these are vivid narratives about some of the most central products in our lives — and they play into one of the most important debates in US politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pNomsn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic calls Apple a “uniquely powerful” company with “unique control” over iOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="emfoi1"&gt;In Epic’s telling, Apple is a “uniquely powerful” company that exerts “unique control” over iOS devices. Apple routes all downloads and purchases through the App Store for financial gain, exercising little oversight over the actual quality of apps — contradicting a public commitment to privacy and security. It leverages its power in one market (the overall iOS ecosystem) to dominate another (app distribution and payments). That’s created less competition to deliver better service at cheaper rates, so users get stuck paying more and miss out on innovative new services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhPmka"&gt;From the other half of the courtroom, Apple claims Epic is threatening what users love about iOS. Creating a single well-vetted app portal produces a “safe, convenient experience” on a device that stores reams of highly personal information, distinguishing the iPhone from competing platforms. Features that limit app distribution were “conscious, reasonable decisions,” Apple says — not attempts to shut down competition. Far from having consumers’ best interests at heart, Epic would simply force Apple to spend money shoring up new privacy and security holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjxHXO"&gt;Epic is losing out on a significant market with its iOS suspension. Court documents say it earned $700 million over its two years in the App Store, even if PlayStation and Xbox consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407939/fortnite-biggest-platform-revenue-playstation-not-ios-iphone"&gt;were far bigger moneymakers&lt;/a&gt;. Apple plans to argue that iPhone and iPad owners have access to other &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-supporting devices, but Epic counters that most people choose only one platform to play on, so a stymied iOS user won’t necessarily pick up &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="16GQsv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple has a lot more at stake here than Epic does.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NitrDa"&gt;The main impact of the trial, though, won’t be getting one game back on the App Store. A big enough loss for Apple could make the company basically rewrite iOS. “Apple has a lot more at stake here than Epic does, though Apple has the stronger hand,” says Christopher Krohn, adjunct associate marketing professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Krohn notes that early in the case, Epic worried that Apple might cut off its App Store access altogether, threatening Epic’s ubiquitous Unreal Engine. But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400240/epic-apple-ruling-unreal-engine-fortnite-temporary-restraining-order"&gt;blocked that move&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, in Apple’s worst-case scenario, the bench could decide that Apple can’t require all iOS developers to use the App Store — striking at a fundamental tenet of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLcoip"&gt;The bench could also conclude that Apple can maintain App Store exclusivity, but it can’t make developers use its in-app purchase system. While that would be less disruptive, it’s still a big deal. In-app purchases — including subscriptions to countless non-gaming services like Spotify — are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21369460/apple-fortnite-app-store-services-business-model-epic-games"&gt;a huge part&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s business. Apple cut its 30 percent App Store commission to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;15 percent for smaller developers&lt;/a&gt;, but according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;one outside estimate&lt;/a&gt;, those developers accounted for a tiny share of its revenue. Losing money from big players would make the App Store a lot less profitable for Apple, and it’s a strong incentive for the company to push back against third-party subscription-based services — which, right now, dominate much of the app ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lATlm2"&gt;Epic is facing an uphill battle. US antitrust enforcement has languished over the past decade, in part because the consumer harm standard is slippery in a world where so many services are free. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), one of Congress’ biggest proponents of antitrust reform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;called private antitrust suits&lt;/a&gt; “very hard to win” in a recent interview. “This is not straightforward, but Apple probably has an advantage,” concludes Michael Cusumano, deputy dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management. And whoever wins the case, the loser will almost certainly appeal, which could delay any concrete results from the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nCyZHW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The case will put Apple’s policies and security under a microscope&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jH8AC9"&gt;That said, the trial is just one part of a larger antitrust push against Apple, and even if the company wins in court, the trial could prove to be a political turning point in the fight to unwind the app store. Over the next three weeks, Apple executives — including CEO Tim Cook — will be grilled for hours on the company’s history and business practices, including the minutiae of how apps are reviewed and how secure the iPhone is. Any unflattering comments, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;one deposition’s claim&lt;/a&gt; that App Review employees were “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight,” could provide fodder for lawmakers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650861/apple-department-of-justice-antitrust-authority-facebook-google-amazon-ftc-investigations"&gt;watchdog agencies&lt;/a&gt;. The trial also gives a fresh soapbox to disgruntled iOS developers like Match Group, which sent a witness to Congress last week and is scheduled to testify in the upcoming trial as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SHPg3"&gt;Epic court documents also raise issues that are tangential to its complaint but pivotal to the larger antitrust debate. That includes Apple’s strategy of vertical integration — a system where it builds incredibly popular devices like the iPhone, then directly competes with the companies making apps and accessories for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZAsr5"&gt;The European Union has already taken aim at Apple’s App Store practices. Last night, the EU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;issued antitrust charges&lt;/a&gt; over the exact issue that sparked the Epic trial: Apple requiring developers to use its in-app purchasing system. That case is limited specifically to music streaming services like Spotify, but it could expand to ebooks and other digital purchases. “This is not the last case we will have when it comes to the App Store,” warned European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BqEI4C"&gt;If Epic’s case fails, US lawmakers could use it to argue that the law itself is broken. Klobuchar has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;singled out the Apple tax&lt;/a&gt; as an example of anti-competitive behavior run amok, calling for new standards that would apply not only to tech but the entire corporate world. Compared to a court blowing up the iOS ecosystem, that’s still a win for Apple — but it means Epic’s lawsuit could leave a mark well beyond the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dolahs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;With reporting by Elizabeth Lopatto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CLzWx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;The trial is before a bench, not a jury. We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to buy the new iPad Pro with the M1 processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad Pro 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q9GZIA0Gfi4WQPK-l2mCpNu-xOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159356/ipadpro2021lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Pro&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GUYWLh"&gt;Apple announced a 2021 refresh to its iPad Pro lineup, which now includes the same powerful and efficient M1 processor that’s in its MacBook Air, Pro, and Mac mini computers. Both the new 11-inch and 12.9-inch models will feature the chip, as well as a Thunderbolt port and optional 5G support. The display on the larger tablet has received a particularly big boost, jumping to a Liquid Retina XDR Mini LED screen. My colleague Monica Chin has gone deeper on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;more of this year’s big improvements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zVUzXt"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;colorful new M1-powered iMacs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;refreshed iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"&gt;updated Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; (with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;not-terrible-looking remote&lt;/a&gt;) are now &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043467/7613?subId1=VergeColorfulMacs043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro"&gt;all available to preorder today&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043467/7613?subId1=VergeColorfulMacs043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-tv%2Fapple-tv-4k"&gt;Apple’s website. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKghJ5"&gt;The company says that the new products will be delivered starting on May 21st —at least for the first wave of orders, although that timing will certainly slip as stock sells out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bn5giu"&gt;Customers interested in &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043467/7613?subId1=VergeColorfulMacs043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac"&gt;buying the new iMac&lt;/a&gt; should take note that only some of the color schemes will be available in stores: green, pink, blue, and silver models will be sold in-person at Apple Store locations, but the full seven-color spectrum will only be offered through Apple’s website, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pG1SBW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474574"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RIuuCz"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043467/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F12.9-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi"&gt;new iPad Pro &lt;/a&gt;also features Apple’s new M1 processor (the same as the iMac and last falls updated MacBooks), in addition to an upgraded ultra-wide angle camera for better video calls. Additionally, the larger 12.9-inch model will feature a new Mini LED display, which promises a far brighter and more accurate screen experience — at the cost of a $100 price increase over the 2020 model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CpLbLU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10456970"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ICQOxQ"&gt;Also of particular note: in addition to the preorders for the updated Apple TV 4K, preorders have also opened for &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043467/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJFM3LL%2FA%2Fsiri-remote"&gt;the standalone $59 Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; for existing Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K (first-gen) owners looking to replace the infamous first-generation Siri Remote with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;(hopefully) better new design&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iujnaU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474579"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W4Vwzt"&gt;Alongside the preorders for the new Apple products, the first wave of last week’s AirTag and purple iPhone 12 and 12 mini devices should be arriving to both customers and in Apple Stores starting today. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU accuses Apple of App Store antitrust violations after Spotify complaint</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqtFOuFebY1LbsCuVX4Zn5glh60=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69210747/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4xjY4"&gt;The European Commission is issuing antitrust charges against Apple over concerns about the company’s App Store practices. The Commission &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2061"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has broken EU competition rules with its App Store policies, following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;initial complaint from Spotify&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019. Specifically, the Commission believes Apple has a “dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through its App Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2aX30"&gt;The EU has focused on two rules that Apple imposes on developers: the mandatory use of Apple’s in-app purchase system (for which Apple charges a 30 percent cut), and a rule forbidding app developers to inform users of other purchasing options outside of apps. The Commission has found that the 30 percent commission fee, or “Apple tax” as it’s often referred to, has resulted in higher prices for consumers. “Most streaming providers passed this fee on to end users by raising prices,” according to the European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hFR5pP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our preliminary conclusion: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; is in breach of EU competition law. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleMusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppleMusic&lt;/a&gt; compete with other music streaming services. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; charges high commission fees on rivals in the App store &amp;amp; forbids them to inform of alternative subscription options. Consumers losing out.&lt;/p&gt;— Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vestager/status/1388071379094982659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2VYy8v"&gt;“Apple’s rules distort competition in the market for music streaming services by raising the costs of competing music streaming app developers,” says a statement from the Commission. “This in turn leads to higher prices for consumers for their in-app music subscriptions on iOS devices.” The EU has also sent Apple a statement of objections, which is essentially a list of how the Commission believes Apple has violated competition rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOdCJp"&gt;This is the initial, formal stage of antitrust proceedings against Apple, and the company will have the chance to respond to the Commission’s list of objections within the next 12 weeks. This specific case is limited to Apple’s App Store practices for music streaming, and the EU is investigating additional separate cases on ebooks and the App Store in general. “This is not the last case we will have when it comes to the App Store,” said European commissioner Margrethe Vestager in a press conference this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvwu7E"&gt;Vestager also revealed the Commission is taking an interest in Apple’s policies around games on the App Store. “We also take an interest in the gaming app market,” said Vestager, responding to a question about the money involved in gaming apps on the App Store. “That’s really early days when it comes to that.” Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296657/microsoft-apple-app-store-antitrust-comments"&gt;called on regulators to investigate the App Store last year&lt;/a&gt;, just a couple of months before a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;public spat with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over its xCloud game streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The EU may look into gaming apps on the App Store, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WN6Lnc"&gt;Apple now faces a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual revenue if it’s found guilty of breaking EU rules, which could be as high as $27 billion based on Apple’s annual revenue of $274.5 billion last year. Apple could also be forced to change its business model, which has more damaging and lasting effects than a fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGyeEf"&gt;Spotify has welcomed the initial charges. “Ensuring the iOS platform operates fairly is an urgent task with far-reaching implications,” says Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify’s chief legal officer. “The European Commission’s statement of objections is a critical step toward holding Apple accountable for its anticompetitive behavior, ensuring meaningful choice for all consumers and a level playing field for app developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlGqEp"&gt;Apple has also responded to the EU’s findings in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jMHOy5"&gt;“Spotify has become the largest music subscription service in the world, and we’re proud for the role we played in that. Spotify does not pay Apple any commission on over 99% of their subscribers, and only pays a 15% commission on those remaining subscribers that they acquired through the App Store. At the core of this case is Spotify’s demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their iOS app, a practice that no store in the world allows. Once again, they want all the benefits of the App Store but don’t think they should have to pay anything for that. The Commission’s argument on Spotify’s behalf is the opposite of fair competition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7ren1R"&gt;Central to this entire case is the 30 percent cut that Apple takes on subscriptions. Companies like Netflix and Spotify have long opposed this so-called Apple tax, but Apple has argued that the revenue contributes toward the costs of maintaining the App Store and enforcing its various content, privacy, and security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPZH40"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18530894/apple-music-monopoly-spotify-app-store-europe"&gt;Spotify previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Apple uses its App Store to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice in favor of its own Apple Music service. That complaint was followed up with a similar one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292625/apple-rakuten-kobo-app-store-antitrust-complaint-europe"&gt;by Rakuten&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that it’s anti-competitive for Apple to take a 30 percent commission on ebooks sold through the App Store while promoting its own Apple Books service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVGfEE"&gt;Epic Games also joined many developers and companies opposing Apple’s App Store policies, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286998/epic-games-apple-european-comission-antitrust-complaint-app-store-fortnite"&gt;filed an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the EU earlier this year. It’s part of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know/archives"&gt;ongoing dispute with Apple&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer publicly criticized Apple’s App Store policies around distribution and payments. This resulted in Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;attempting to circumvent&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite, and &lt;/em&gt;Apple quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removing the game from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pp0rbg"&gt;Apple has eased some of its policies over the past year, as the pushback against the App Store grows louder. Apple now lets some video streaming apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;bypass the App Store cut&lt;/a&gt;, and it has reduced its App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;commission rate to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for any developer that earns less than $1 million in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple adds a way to speed up searches on the App Store by suggesting words</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I84pK6Ff1OVJoG3QqhzZ_U6t_s4=/266x0:1129x575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208989/Image_21.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qFFjoR"&gt;Apple has added &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore/status/1387865090007908357?s=20"&gt;a new App Store search suggestions feature&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, that might make it easier to find apps. Now, after typing in a search term, the App Store will attempt to predict what you’re looking for and offer suggested words that, when tapped, will further narrow down your search results and speed up your hunt for specific kinds of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlpL1h"&gt;Search suggestions actually appeared on some iPhones earlier in April as part of a test, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/app-store-search-tags/"&gt;according to MacRumors&lt;/a&gt;, but now the feature should be rolling out to all iPhones in the supported regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vzex1Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Introducing search suggestions on the App Store!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Select (or deselect) multiple suggestions to refine your search so you can find even more amazing apps and games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Search suggestions roll out today starting with the USA, Canada, the UK, and Australia. &lt;a href="https://t.co/viaZHlCZMb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/viaZHlCZMb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— App Store (@AppStore) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore/status/1387865090007908357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ahMf2E"&gt;Using search suggestions is pretty simple. Let’s say I’m looking for an app to help me make some pizza from scratch: I can type “pizza” in the App Store’s search field and see additional words pop up like “maker,” “game,” “call,” “calculator,” or “order.” Selecting one of those suggestions filters the results further, so choosing calculator will pull up apps for calculating the correct ratio ingredients for pizza dough (surprisingly there’s a lot of those). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HCpMupZchS3unTOR5WbablRSkHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479656/Image_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunting for “pizza calculators” using the new App Store search suggestions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bTN0i6"&gt;Currently, not every search allows you to select multiple suggestions. I was able to refine Apple’s example of “food” with “delivery” and “Indian,” but my other sample searches only gave me one filter each. Not every search brings up a suggested filter, either. We’ve reached out to Apple for clarification on when suggestions appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3J5PB"&gt;What does consistently show up in search are ads, which Apple originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13184346/apple-app-store-ads"&gt;added to App Store search in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easy to see how my plan to make pizza from scratch could get derailed by a big Uber Eats or Papa John’s ad above my helpful dough calculator app. Ordering delivery is so much easier than doing math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45Z4KY"&gt;Those ads are likely to inflame Apple’s App Store critics further — they’ll no doubt argue that an indie developer trying to make it easier to figure out the ratios of water to flour in pizza shouldn’t have to compete with Uber’s ad budget, the same way &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1019859186224594944?s=20"&gt;they think competing apps shouldn’t be buying ads in front of one another’s products&lt;/a&gt; while Apple profits from the result. But every change to a search engine has winners and losers, and it’s not yet clear whether this one will make it easier or harder for small developers to get more exposure. They could wind up being helpful for everyone who uses the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCWHHB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games v. Apple: the fight for the future of the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RicCkIxRkoBro3EhEkKhuc-Xz_U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208985/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;All the news about the huge trial&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NIDuFm"&gt;After months of preparation, Epic Games will finally take on Apple in court in a trial that could fundamentally change the makeup of the App Store. The fight dates back to August, when Epic added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;direct payment mechanism&lt;/a&gt; to its hit battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in violation of Apple’s rules. The iPhone maker quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed the game from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic responded shortly after with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;an antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; aiming to establish the App Store as a monopoly. The case will finally be brought to trial starting May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0C56NR"&gt;The trial promises to deliver huge revelations about the inner workings of one of the biggest and most influential companies in the world, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405894/epic-apple-store-fortnite-trial-kickoff-witnesses-list"&gt;with testimony&lt;/a&gt; from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Craig Federighi, Phil Schiller, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, and more. We’ve already made some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition"&gt;fascinating&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407939/fortnite-biggest-platform-revenue-playstation-not-ios-iphone"&gt;discoveries&lt;/a&gt; from documents published ahead of the trial, and there’s sure to be a lot more news ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoXeg2"&gt;You can follow along with everything right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says old Magic Keyboard is ‘functionally compatible’ with new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but warns of imperfect fit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0X7eFBxQ5-anSfYUtk_1anrQrkY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207327/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PSPjRS"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;upcoming 2021 refresh of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; — which will feature an M1 processor and a new Mini LED display — will work with the 2020 model of the 12.9-inch Magic Keyboard case after all. But it’s not going to be a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgnlQG"&gt;According to a newly added note to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211091"&gt;an Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriswb/status/1387851740876210176"&gt;spotted by Chris Ball on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) the first-generation Magic Keyboard (model number A1998) will be “functionally compatible” with the updated iPad Pro. But due to the slightly thicker dimensions of the new 12.9-inch model (which is 0.5mm thicker than the 2020 version), Apple warns that “it’s possible that the Magic Keyboard may not precisely fit when closed, especially when screen protectors are applied.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/76B5BMxsGY6bLgupRGvDvaONS6c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22478941/Screen_Shot_2021_04_29_at_3.37.31_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YOh2ca"&gt;Apple updated the document with clarification today (&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210426043303/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211091"&gt;an earlier copy of the same document&lt;/a&gt; from last week does not contain the compatibility information). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399095/apple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-2020-models-magic-keyboard-incompatible"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; had reported earlier&lt;/a&gt; that the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro would not be compatible with the older case, but it appears Apple has decided it will narrowly work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6Qdix"&gt;While the old Magic Keyboard will still work, it seems that Apple is trying to encourage customers toward buying the new case, which presumably has more room to accommodate the thicker tablet. But given that the Magic Keyboard accessory for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $349, along with the relatively short time since its release, it’s easy to see why owners of the older model weren’t too excited about the prospect of having to shell out for a new accessory, especially when considering the $1,099 starting price of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPqMZH"&gt;All of this confusion only applies to the larger, 12.9-inch iPad Pro hardware, however. The 11-inch model (which isn’t getting a new Mini LED display and features identical measurements to the 2020 model) is still fully compatible with the 2020 version of its Magic Keyboard accessory. &lt;/p&gt;
