    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is getting Group Workouts and Pilates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3oqT0MfHuSsJhghI9v_7n7eRCs=/213x0:2301x1392/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857547/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_10.35.45_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tIrUqk"&gt;Apple has announced a Group Workouts feature for Apple Fitness Plus, Fitness Plus will also be coming to fifteen new countries, including Brazil, France, Mexico, and Russia, and workouts will be getting subtitles in six languages. There are new workouts, including guided meditation, pilates, and programs to help you prepare for winter sports like skiing and snowboarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftiCN8"&gt;Group Workouts will let Fitness Plus subscribers do a workout with a friend (or a group of up to 32 people), starting it through an iMessage or FaceTime call. On your screen, you’ll be able to see both the instructor and the people that you’re sharing the workout with (hopefully Apple will include an option to turn your camera off if it gets too embarrassing). You’ll also see your metrics and rings, but will be able to see how your friends are doing on the “burn bar” competition feature, and when they close their rings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8482MJgCqXGJ3aHvWe9Yyh7FpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850255/lcimg_cfac3cae_b68c_43d1_bc9f_efbb09578a02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now friends and family can see how much I struggle with cardio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PegOdX"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple hasn’t announced a way to let two people share a workout on the same screen, though you likely could share a workout with a roommate or family member if you each have your own device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eg1_Kw3HSjffGZUViY2BJzs1IW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850268/lcimg_5d8283a0_fdee_4540_b161_d937e74db109.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitness Plus will soon be available in these countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4zoOU"&gt;To go with the new guided meditation workout, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;upcoming Mindfulness app&lt;/a&gt; will include audio versions of the mediations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eksMqF"&gt;Group Workouts and support for new countries will be coming “later this fall,” which makes sense as Apple already announced that SharePlay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;won’t be launching with iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the features will be coming out later this month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max announced with high refresh rate 120Hz displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KT2X-gvGS17lneGO-3UDXAvi8Fs=/147x0:1737x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857534/bHfOSj7.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1paZ9b"&gt;Apple has officially announced the high-end part of the iPhone 13 lineup: the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. It’s got a faster A15 Bionic chip, three all-new cameras, and an improved display with up to a 120Hz ProMotion high refresh rate display that can go as bright as 1,000 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9Shn0"&gt;The OLED screens on both models are the same sizes as last year at 6.1 and 6.7-inches, but with slightly smaller notches that should allow for more space in the iOS status bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1k9Wur"&gt;Internally, both devices are using Apple’s new A15 Bionic chip, which offers the familiar CPU and GPU speed increases compared to last year. Apple also says the chip should be faster for machine learning tasks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtNAGq"&gt;This is the third year Apple is splitting its flagship phone lineup into regular and “Pro” devices. Last year, however, many reviewers noted that there wasn’t much of a difference between the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the 12 Pro had an extra telephoto camera, lidar sensor, and more RAM and base storage, but its basic design, processor, 5G capabilities, and OLED display were all similar, if not identical, to the regular iPhone 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwZ1UV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22436135"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 13 and Apple Watch event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 announced with redesigned camera array and smaller notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xsB-LBOr9G4ouVpZhig85sRirt0=/136x0:1525x926/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857392/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.39.54_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CkNTNs"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 has officially arrived — the baseline, most mainstream model that will set the bar for Apple’s 2021 phone lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FkoaW"&gt;As with last year, the entry-level iPhone 13 will come in two versions: the 6.1-inch “regular” model and the smaller 5.4-inch iPhone 13 Mini. The screen is still an OLED panel, the sides still aluminum sandwiched between two slabs of glass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="inA1I2"&gt;Pricing starts at $799 for the iPhone 13 and $699 for the smaller iPhone 13 Mini. Storage options for this year’s models have been bumped up, with Apple offering 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations for the two models. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikW79s5y-RaBDX8CAEJJHBCIuss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850282/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.41.05_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xtBs1l"&gt;There’s not much in the way of radical new features or changes here; instead, the iPhone 13 is closer to Apple’s old “S”-year model of iPhones, offering some refinements and improvements to last year’s design rather than monumental new features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frlcut"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, which saw a substantial redesign, the iPhone 13 has the same broad look as last year’s model, just with a slimmed-down Face ID notch that’s 20 percent smaller, meaning it’ll take up less space at the top of your phone. It’s not quite the minimal look that hole-punch displays offer on Android, but it’s a nice-looking improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A6dgF"&gt;There’s also a more powerful processor: the A15 Bionic, which Apple says is faster and more power-efficient than last year’s A14 Bionic chip. It’s still a 5nm chip and still a 6-core CPU (with two new high-performance and four new high-efficiency cores) — but Apple says it’s the “fastest CPU in a smartphone,” up to 50 percent faster than the competition. It also says that graphics are up to 30 percent faster than its competitors (although, it doesn’t specify who it’s comparing to). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WIJvID"&gt;The new iPhone 13 lineup will also offer better battery life: the iPhone 13 Mini will get 1.5 hours more battery life than the iPhone 12 Mini, while the larger iPhone 13 should get up to  2.5 hours more battery life compared to the iPhone 12, thanks to bigger batteries, better performance from the A15 Bionic, and additional software improvements and optimizations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DusYFhdF-o9khj_qW4kSDgZQ2io=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850280/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.51.10_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oZS6Ik"&gt;The biggest change actually comes in the form of trickled-down camera technology from last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;: the base iPhone 13 has gotten the same souped-up camera that Apple debuted with its biggest smartphone in 2020, with a physically larger sensor for the wide camera that’s 47 percent bigger than last year, allowing it to capture more light in darker environments with less noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj12S7"&gt;The new wide sensor is a 12-megapixel lens with an f/1.6 aperture, while the new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera features a faster f/2.4 lens and 120-degree field of view. The iPhone 13 will also feature the sensor-shift stabilization technology that Apple introduced last year on the 12 Pro Max, which physically moves the wide sensor to reduce vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XrhMCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max announced with high refresh rate 120Hz displays","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"},{"title":"The Apple Watch Series 7 has a brand-new look","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uuXWwk"&gt;Apple also introduced a new “cinematic mode” for video that allows for a rack focus effect to change the focus during a video, which the company showed off in an amusing &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt;-style parody. When recording a video, cinematic mode will automatically transition focus while filming in real time, intelligently shifting focus when people enter the frame or glance away from the camera. You’ll be able to manually change focus or lock focus on a particular object for more precise control, too. The front-facing camera will also feature cinematic mode support. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQ1gNooRRwRVRPeH7FQB8wNsDUA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850302/lcimg_385816e3_76e0_4fe7_b78e_de8db4c4b292.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dy7G8r"&gt;Apple is also promising improved 5G performance compared to the iPhone 12, with more band support for better international 5G experiences. The company promises the iPhone will support 200 carriers in over 60 countries and regions by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAEIOL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22436135"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 13 and Apple Watch event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 7 has a brand-new look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3KmOcNdHS14eA3HasoLgaVr8qQ=/74x0:820x497/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857319/Capto_Capture_2021_09_14_01_24_25_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CojUH9"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 looks a little different than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;its predecessors&lt;/a&gt;. The display now goes virtually to the edge of the case. That means while the watch isn’t much bigger, everything on it should be more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shMhTn"&gt;The bezels around the display are slimmer at just 1.7mm, and the always-on screen mode is 70 percent brighter. Apple claims you can cram 50 percent more text onto the display than the Series 6. The new display also means new ways to interact, with a full keyboard that will support swiping. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W6J4CQGkReba4ZGf-0Jmk7rLl_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850197/lcimg_5ab83a83_d836_4e82_b8f5_f6ccdf0eee9f.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series 7 on the right isn’t that much larger, but it should feel bigger, thanks to much smaller bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O6YXWO"&gt;There’s a new set of watchfaces to take advantage of the larger screen, including a more modular watchface so you can really peer at all the micro details related to your active rings, and a funky new watchface meant to highlight the minuscule bezels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv1BXr"&gt;But a bigger display doesn’t mean it’s more delicate: Apple claims it’s crack resistant and now has an IP6X rating, which means it should be able to take a dunk in the sand at the beach or handle other dusty environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4vtU0"&gt;The small Apple Watch went from 40mm to 41mm and the big Watch from 44mm to 45mm. That makes these watches the largest Apple Watches to date. In fact, the small Apple Watch is now just 1mm smaller than the largest one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125873/apple-watch-smartwatch-announced"&gt;introduced back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6KnQz"&gt;Apart from the changes above the Series 7 is an awful lot like the Series 6. Same sensors and processors, and none of the big square redesign that’s been rumored. Like the Series 6, the new Series 7 will also &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/battery/"&gt;offer up to 18 hours of battery life&lt;/a&gt; and include a charger that charges via USB-C instead of USB-A and charges up to 33-percent faster (and Apple claims 8 minutes of charging will give you up to 8 hours of battery life). The aluminum variation will come in five colors total, the usual black, gold, blue and red, plus a dark green that feels in sync with the rugged new support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yWtSu4UACW7kFWvzFlbtzN6QQ84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850224/lcimg_d5b7c216_a765_44c8_94ea_3a59eb0563f3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;That green looks practically black!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D1xWcN"&gt;Besides the refreshes to the premium Apple Watch, Apple’s also added some new features to Watch OS 8. Outdoor cycling will now have better support and should automatically pause the workout when you stop at a light or just to catch a break. Fall support will now also appear in workouts, so if you wreck your bike or trip up badly during a brutal HIIT workout the watch will be able to contact emergency services. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673993/apple-fitness-plus-workouts-countries-languages-pilates-snow"&gt;Fitness Plus is also getting some upgrades&lt;/a&gt;, including Pilates and the ability to do workouts with friends via SharePlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbBblG"&gt;The Watch Series 3 is sticking around and starting a $199 and the Watch SE will be available for $279, while the new Series 7 will start at $399. The Series 7 should be available later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE4koI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22436135"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 13 and Apple Watch event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All-new iPad Mini announced with 5G, USB-C, and larger 8.3-inch display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQ-Fh3V_HHaNuR5iECA4AxONDP8=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857249/lcimg_7b04f92e_6e3b_4b04_83c7_9381b0d97513.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="atJv07"&gt;Apple has announced its all-new iPad Mini. It features a new enclosure with narrower bezels and rounded corners. The big news is that it’s larger than the iPad Mini 5 with an 8.3-inch display (up from its predecessor’s 7.9-inch panel), making the device even more viable as a driver for multitasking or schoolwork. Apple says the screen can reach 500 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHmNxr"&gt;The iPad Mini is currently Apple’s smallest tablet, even with the bump in size. Apple was rumored to have been considering a Mini LED display on the new iPad, similar to that of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;largest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Those appear to have missed the mark; the new Mini sports a regular Liquid Retina display.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncuFA65v4fZQrYnuxxe0gdDFiPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850183/lcimg_90987419_14bd_47ba_b425_5984e2255904.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ILSQY3"&gt;The iPad Mini’s design has remained largely consistent since its 2012 debut. The new model is something of a shake-up to the traditional build, featuring slimmer bezels than the iPad Mini 5 and new color options. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RMePML"&gt;The new tablet also features a USB-C port, Touch ID (no Face ID), a new speaker system with stereo in landscape mode, and upgraded 12MP cameras on the front and back, including a shooter with True Tone flash and 4K video recording on the back and a new 12MP ultrawide camera on the front, which will support Apple’s Center Stage feature. It also supports Wi-Fi 6 and 5G (with download speeds up to 3.5 gigabits per second) as well as the second-generation Apple Pencil, which attaches magnetically to the side of the chassis.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are new slim covers, but no mention of a keyboard cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qhemxg"&gt;The enclosure also incorporates 100 percent recycled aluminum; the solder of the main logic board includes 100 percent recycled tin, and the enclosure magnets are 100 percent rare earth elements. Apple claims you can expect 40 percent faster CPU performance and 80 percent faster GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6lIdp"&gt;The new iPad Mini is up for preorder today and will be available next week starting at $499.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new entry-level iPad with A13 Bionic chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emMeRePA-FWf8weLeznyupOdvsc=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857219/lcimg_06408afc_ebbc_4bcf_a6a4_db043132841a.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIQyWB"&gt;Apple has just announced the latest version of its most popular tablet: the standard iPad. This new model is the ninth generation of the iPad that first debuted in 2010, and it features a new processor called the A13 Bionic. Additionally, there’s a new 12-megapixel front camera that supports the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt; that debuted with the iPad Pro last year. The rest of the 9th Gen iPad will look very familiar to anyone who has seen an iPad in the past few years, complete with the same home button, bezels, single rear camera, and Lightning port we’ve seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9GfH4"&gt;Apple says the new processor is 20 percent faster than the one in the outgoing model. The 10.2-inch display is the same size and resolution as before, but it now supports the True Tone feature that automatically adjusts the screen’s color temperature to ambient lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IVyTLKRSkH9TzQrHmXU7mL_wRAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850102/lcimg_f2245adc_fcad_44a9_9744_ee7dfc6b75b9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 9th Gen iPad supports the first-generation Apple Pencil.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KeYlTE"&gt;The latest iPad will ship with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, which was announced earlier this year and includes enhancements to the iPad’s homescreen, app organization, and multitasking features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mx1lPy"&gt;The base-model iPad is the one most people gravitate toward, as it’s the most economical model in the lineup. This year, Apple has bumped the base storage to 64GB and kept the starting $329 price the same. The iPad is also compatible with the first-generation Apple Pencil and the Apple Smart Keyboard. It will be available in silver or space gray and can be ordered starting today, September 14th, with deliveries expected for next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SgXDy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22436135"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 13 and Apple Watch event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple iPhone 13 and Apple Watch live blog: ‘California Streaming’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;On such a winter’s day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="UsbJQM"&gt;The time has come for yet another iPhone announcement — plus whatever else Apple might have up its sleeve. Sleeve’s the right metaphor, actually, as new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;Apple Watches&lt;/a&gt; are expected today in addition to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. The keynote kicks off online at 10AM PT / 1PM ET and we’ll be live blogging the whole thing right here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmzoGT"&gt;For the iPhone 13, we expect we’ll see the usual camera improvements and faster processors. The cameras may have a new astrophotography trick. There are also rumors that the notch in the screen that houses the FaceID sensors will be smaller this year — but still much larger than the hole punches we see on Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ab6gJ"&gt;For the watch, we might get the first big design change ever. Apple may be dropping the rounded, lozenge shape in favor of flatter sides that match the design of the newer iPhones and iPads. Bigger screens and better batteries are also rumored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uYnZU"&gt;What else? Probably some AirPods. Maybe some iPads. We doubt there will be Macs. But Apple has a lot of product lines that are potential candidates for updates — not to mention new versions of its operating systems to get out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjVCcH"&gt;We’ll be covering it all, right here. Tune in!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 may finally get features Android has had for years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJ80i-6mzVET3bBSxNSOoqLHlxc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855600/vpavic_4243_20201017_0077.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="APrmyo"&gt;It’s new iPhone day. And as with any new smartphone announcement these days, we have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;fairly decent idea of what to expect&lt;/a&gt;. Leaks and rumors are more accurate than ever, and though there’s always the potential of a big surprise, the most likely scenario is the iPhone 13 will be what we think it will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXjXsF"&gt;Just because the rumors are clear doesn’t mean they’re not exciting, though. This year, the iPhone 13 (we assume that’s the name) will have some new technology in the same design. New designs tend to drive big upgrade cycles, but it’s the second year of the design that usually has the most interesting refinements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQuJJ"&gt;We can list them out fairly quickly. There should be four iterations again: a Mini, a regular, a Pro, and a Pro Max. The higher-end iPhones should have an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display, a low-power kind of OLED screen that makes it easier to have a variable refresh rate. The processors will be faster. The MagSafe charging system will be tweaked. There may be new storage options. The camera will be better, with improvements specifically in HDR and Portrait Mode video — plus astrophotography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgAmZ3"&gt;All those specs will translate into some newer, nicer experiences. There’s one in particular I want to focus on: the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiwNKM"&gt;The LTPO display should mean that the iPhone can finally have an always-on lock screen. It should also finally enable smoother transitions as the screen ratchets from some tiny number of Hz to some large number like 120Hz instead of being locked at 60Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlObj2"&gt;Notice the “finallys” in that last paragraph. They’re there because variable refresh rates and always-on screens have been available on Android phones since... forever. In fact, if you run down the rumored features of the new iPhones, many of them appeared first on Android. In addition to high refresh rate screens, there’s better quality wide-angle cameras, huge storage, portrait mode video, and astrophotography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZVR57R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Apple’s iPhone 13 event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"},{"title":"iPhone 13 might finally bring a smaller notch and faster screens","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"},{"title":"All-new iPad Mini announced with 5G, USB-C, and larger 8.3-inch display","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3X0Ms9"&gt;Though the specs may be copied, the question comes back to the “experience.” The cliche with Apple is that it rarely does something first, but instead comes in later with refinements and does it &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;. That cliche exists because it’s often right. You may have been able to turn on portrait mode for video on a Samsung phone since 2019, but believe me, you wouldn’t want to use it for anything important, because it’s bad. Apple’s, hopefully, will be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8kodL"&gt;That narrative isn’t always correct, though. In some cases, it just papers over Apple just being straight up late to including a piece of technology. I am open to being wrong, but I hesitate to believe that it’s possible to make an always-on lock screen experience so insanely great that that every one before feels broken. It’s a lock screen you can glance at! There’s only so much to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKlarI"&gt;An always-on lock screen is also super useful! Being able to quickly see the time, date, and some notification icons is the sort of low-pressure ambient information a phone should be able to provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CmqUr"&gt;Variable refresh rates are a little less useful, but so much nicer. They can preserve battery life by slowing down refresh rates. They can match the screen’s refresh rate to the content (eg. in a movie or a game). And they can make animations and scrolling look so much smoother. And yet, the only notable Apple devices to feature a high refresh rate are its high-end iPads. Meanwhile, every high-end Android phone and many midrangers have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pDPDDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does Apple feel competitive pressure to include small, nice-to-have features?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LOAVkN"&gt;I’m honestly a little baffled as to why it’s taken Apple this long to make such obviously nice features. One possible explanation — and maybe the most likely — is simply that Apple has felt no competitive pressure to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSKNkN"&gt;On Android, there are so many phones to choose from that the need to differentiate is urgently and keenly felt by every manufacturer. So a feature as minor as an always-on display could make the difference in somebody’s purchasing decision. But I struggle to imagine the person that would choose an Android phone over an iPhone simply because they like glancing down at the time on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4sDXo"&gt;So: why launch a variable refresh rate screen now? It’s gotten to the point where it’s a little embarrassing — many reviews of the iPhone 12 models pointed out this missing spec. And though iOS does still look smooth and feel fast at 60Hz, going to 120Hz has been Android’s brute force way of catching up in those departments. Switching iOS up to 120Hz could push Apple ahead again. So there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some competitive pressure, it just takes a bit longer to show up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWjTGE"&gt;I also suspect that Apple was simply waiting for component prices to come down and manufacturing yields to go up. The scale at which Apple needs to make phones makes both a requirement. But I feel like if Apple felt a little more competitive pressure, it could have pushed more aggressively to solve those problems sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HkL1bU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android vs. Android is a war of tiny differences — iPhone vs. Android is something else entirely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xI9kyI"&gt;The point here is that there are lots of little features that iPhone users are missing out on simply because they’re not compelling enough on their own to convince people to switch. Under-screen fingerprint sensors on Android phones have gone from mediocre to great in just a few short years. Telephoto lenses are folded into periscopes that run along the lengths of the phone for even longer zooms. Screens are interrupted by only tiny little punch holes for selfie cameras (or, in some cases, not interrupted at all). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8cgbX"&gt;These are all niceties that aren’t a huge loss if you’re an iPhone user — well worth the tradeoff for the ecosystem, hardware quality, and performance you get with the average iPhone. They come first to Android because the pressure to compete against other Android phones is so intense that any little advantage matters. If there are two new phones on the store shelf that are very nearly the same but one has an always-on screen, well, that’s the one you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABsfZ0"&gt;iOS and Android are not at all the same, though. So when it comes to bringing these smaller hardware features to the iPhone, I can’t help but think that the competitive pressure Apple feels most urgently isn’t the smartphones you see on the store shelf. It’s the iPhone you’ve got in your pocket. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s ‘California Streaming’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Holds Event Virtually" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YJDjIb6_70pdn3aNO-UrqRaF0PY=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855414/1221930031.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m80YT8"&gt;It’s September, which means iPhone season is just nearly here. The rumor mill has been spinning about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;highly anticipated iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, a third generation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and the potential for new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt;. A new, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;bezel-less iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; is also a possibility, as is the official release of iOS 15 and macOS Monterey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HiZ05"&gt;Since Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;sent out the invite&lt;/a&gt; for its “California Streaming” event, we’ve been able to take guesses at what hidden meanings there might be to decipher from the night sky and the illuminated Apple logo, but just when does it actually get underway and where?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MHCz0z"&gt;What time does the iPhone 13 event start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6Hw1Q3"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event will go live at 10AM PT / 1PM ET today, Tuesday, September 14th. Like all Apple keynotes since the beginning of the pandemic, it will likely amount to a lengthy infomercial recorded and streamed from the Apple Park campus, with everyone from Tim Cook on down presenting. We expect the recording to become available shortly after its debut, too, in the event you miss out on the prerecorded livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UFZ2Pg"&gt;Where can I watch the Apple event?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0CHXFL"&gt;Apple is hosting the stream &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/event-stream/"&gt;on its site&lt;/a&gt;, per usual, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvGOlAkLSLw"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve embedded the YouTube video above, so you can set a reminder or watch live from this very post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGebcM"&gt;Also, be sure to keep tabs on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672094/apple-event-iphone-13-live-blog-news-announcements"&gt;live blog&lt;/a&gt; if you can’t watch the video while at work or if you prefer to follow along with our editors as announcements are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Wvup"&gt;Other ways to keep up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vNbyFA"&gt;Apple has released a suite of new updates for &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212807"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212804"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212806"&gt;watchOS&lt;/a&gt; to fix a bug that &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/"&gt;security researchers at Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt; say was very likely exploited to allow government agencies to install spyware into the phones of journalists, lawyers, and activists. The researchers say the bug allowed for a “zero-click” install (meaning the target didn’t have to do anything to be infected) of the Pegasus spyware, which is reportedly capable of stealing data, passwords, and activating a phone’s microphone or camera. You can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;our explainer of Pegusus here&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghtgyJ"&gt;Given the severity of the exploit, you should update to iOS 14.8, macOS Big Sur 11.6, and watchOS 7.6.2 as soon as you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gDzdFG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s update page says it’s “aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11sjdQ"&gt;We heard about the exploit in August, &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/"&gt;when Citizen Lab reported&lt;/a&gt; that it had been successfully used against phones running iOS 14.6 (released in May). Citizen Lab also said the vulnerability, which it codenamed “ForcedEntry,” seemed to match the behavior of an exploit Amnesty International &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/"&gt;wrote about in July&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the security researchers wrote that it was made possible by a bug in Apple’s CoreGraphics system, and happened when the phone tried to use a function related to GIFs, after it received a text message containing a malicious file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY3uHD"&gt;However, even with that info, it could be difficult to pin down exactly what was happening without access to the infected files themselves. &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild"&gt;According to Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered files while re-analyzing a backup from an activist’s hacked phone. The files appeared to be GIFs sent as SMS attachments, but were actually PSDs and PDFs. (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212807"&gt;Apple’s update notes&lt;/a&gt; say that the issue occurred when processing a maliciously crafted PDF.) Citizen Lab suspected they could’ve been related to Pegasus, so it sent the files to Apple on September 7th. Apple quickly released the software updates patching the bug on September 13th, and thanked Citizen Lab in a statement for “completing the very difficult work of obtaining a sample of this exploit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IweTQR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS 14.8 is seemingly only focused on security&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TEuK8F"&gt;Some of Monday’s updates also fix a second security issue with WebKit for iOS and macOS Big Sur (it isn’t mentioned in the release notes for Catalina). While it’s unclear if it’s related to NSO’s exploits — its discovery is attributed to “an anonymous researcher” instead of Citizen Lab, and it’s in a different part of the system — Apple still says that it “may have been actively exploited.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWQTAy"&gt;Such an urgent security issue explains why we’re seeing a new update to iOS just a day before an Apple event, where it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;expected to announced new phones&lt;/a&gt; that will probably never run this version of the OS. Still, there have been rumors about an iOS 14.8 release &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/09/ios-14-8-release-date-information-rumor/"&gt;since early August&lt;/a&gt;, but given that Monday’s release seems to only deal with the security issues discovered in September, it’s possible we’ll see at least one more iOS 14 release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="55m3eu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Keep your devices up-to-date&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eLzesV"&gt;CoreGraphics’ PDF rendering seems to have been problematic recently when it comes to security. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212601"&gt;iOS 14.7 also included a fix&lt;/a&gt; for a seemingly separate issue with the system, which could also lead to arbitrary code execution. WebKit has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251149/iphone-update-14-4-fixes-exploited-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;recently had&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251149/iphone-update-14-4-fixes-exploited-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;few updates&lt;/a&gt; to fix security issues that Apple says “may have been actively exploited.” When news of the CoreGraphics exploit broke in August, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it was working on improving security for iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaocFK"&gt;All of this serves as a reminder about how important it is to keep all your devices up-to-date. While you hopefully never find yourself on the bad side of a government using advanced spyware, it’s still a good idea to make sure that your device isn’t vulnerable to widely-reported security exploits. Thankfully, Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-android-fragmentation-with-ios-15/"&gt;planning on letting&lt;/a&gt; users install security updates for iOS 14 without having to upgrade to iOS 15, which could be useful for any future fixes. For the time being, though, get all your devices updated as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1LRoB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 13th, 7:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added quote from Apple’s statement thanking Citizen Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
