    <title>1Password subscriptions are 50 percent off for Verge readers today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52UQahxcn0uMeTuTL6gMzvbz41s=/63x0:1938x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802439/item_details_view.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yk8VZ1"&gt;Many of us would agree that online protection is more vital than ever before, but trying to remember a random string of letters and symbols for every site you frequent — or don’t — isn’t always easy. Password managers like 1Password are a great way to store your login credentials and beef up your security, however, one that can also save you plenty of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDv1yP"&gt;Thankfully, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can save 50 percent on their first year of 1Password for a limited time, whether they opt for an &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-15026552?sid=VergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;individual plan&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-15026551?sid=VergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;family subscription&lt;/a&gt;. The individual plan normally runs $2.99 a month and comes out to be around $36 per year, yet our exclusive discount brings the annual price down to $18. The family plan, meanwhile, will run you $2.50 a month instead of $5, culminating in $30 a year. Keep in mind, however, that the family plan is limited to five people and that each plan is only available to new 1Password users, not returning customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7rckI"&gt;In terms of features, 1Password offers quite a few. Not only does the service store your login details, but it will send you alerts for compromised sites and vulnerable passwords, while security features like authenticated encryption keep your data safe. You can also use the service on unlimited devices and enjoy 24/7 customer support if you hit a snag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0nXk1j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10426335"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="XTiUco"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10437502"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Us84ji"&gt;If you have yet to pick up a smart speaker, the second-generation Echo Show 8 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-8-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B084DC4LW6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688708099700197#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $100, matching its best price ever. Unlike the previous generation, the 2021 Echo Show 8 boasts faster performance and a superior 13-megapixel camera. It also features the same display, design, and speaker system as its predecessor, which is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-8/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for $80&lt;/a&gt;. We consider the second-gen model the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart speaker you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you intend to use the smart display for video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qwPCKk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mdfWru"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08WFTZ9LY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling&lt;/a&gt; the 75-inch QLED Q80A Series TV at an all-time low, taking around $500 off the typical list price. Normally $2,700, you can pick up the TV — which was released earlier this year — for just $2,198. Better yet, a few &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers saw in the fine print that if you purchase it before September 30th and use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;B6PXLX23DQL9&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout, Amazon will give you $400 in credit to use on future purchases. Not a bad deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSEQma"&gt;The 4K TV delivers wide viewing angles thanks to its IPS panel while producing bright and colorful images. It’s a good buy for gamers, too, who will enjoy the low input lag and support for variable refresh rate (VRR) and AMD FreeSync technology. While we haven’t tested this specific model, &lt;a href="https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/content/samsung-q80a-qled-tv-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reviewed&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that movie fans may not appreciate the low contrast levels or relatively lackluster local dimming feature, which can make it hard to watch HDR content or films in a dark room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Op1XkD"&gt;Amazon’s current deal comes just a week after the retailer also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08WFLBLWP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cut the price of the 55-inch model by $200&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it to a record low of $1,098. Other sizes are similarly discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="g1p9br"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds, you can pick up a refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164914311936%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeGetaoneyear1Passwordsubscriptionfor50percentoffAUG312021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651065%2F1password-amazon-echo-show-8-samsung-qled-tv-jabra-elite-85t-apple-deals-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$117 at eBay through Jabra’s digital storefront&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;SAVE15LABORDAY&lt;/strong&gt;. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Amazon for $180 new&lt;/a&gt;, meaning eBay’s refurbished discount equates to an additional $63 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk6SHI"&gt;Released in November, the 85t are the first pair of earbuds from Jabra to ship with active noise cancellation. In contrast to the AirPods Pro and Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds, they’re also capable of simultaneously pairing with two devices. You can also buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688339690161172#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t at best Buy right now for $100&lt;/a&gt;, however, if you want solid noise cancellation and excellent on-earbud controls, it may be worth forking over the extra $17 for the refurbished Elite 85t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2zWZiX"&gt;For a limited time, Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Smart Battery Case is more than half off its usual price. Once again, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHMJ77/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750684926448631384#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are both selling the $130 case for a record low of $52. Best Buy is also throwing in a free, six-month subscription to Apple Music and Apple News Plus for new users. The case offers a decent amount of charge — Apple says you can expect “up to 50 percent” extra battery life — while boasting features such as a physical camera button and the ability to charge your iPhone and battery case simultaneously. At the same time, its soft microfiber lining gives your phone some additional protection.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fy2ETY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607518"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple pledges another small but welcome sum to racial justice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9Y_J8KAdDaqwZr6u6njzXwXsLI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801019/VRG_4132_BigTechs_Commitment_Lede_FR.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2rpl3"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-broadens-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-with-30-million-in-new-commitments%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22651312%2Fapple-pledges-another-small-but-welcome-sum-to-racial-justice" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has pledged&lt;/a&gt; another $30 million to racial justice, on top of the $100 million it promised last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV1EwC"&gt;It includes funding for a wide array of causes, including a Global Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Equity Innovation Hub at California State University Northridge in Los Angeles, with the intent to create regional hubs at other universities, and an expansion of its work to bring community coding centers to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by adding 11 additional schools to the roster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MXnnS"&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;we calculated just how small the donations from Big Tech were compared to their immense profits&lt;/a&gt;, and today’s $30 million doesn’t really change the calculus there. At the rate Apple is currently raking in cash, it takes just 2.31 hours, or roughly 139 minutes, to make $30 million in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UTzh38"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$30 million for Apple is like $7.51 to the median US family&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drXnY3"&gt;Or — to bring the comparison down to earth a bit — it’s like if &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-270.html"&gt;a middle-class US family&lt;/a&gt; made a one-time donation of seven dollars and fifty-one cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmKs0I"&gt;It’s also not entirely clear how much of Apple’s now-$130 million contribution is in the form of donations, rather than investments where Apple might get its money back: in January, the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fapple-launches-major-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-projects-to-challenge-systemic-racism-advance-racial-equity-nationwide%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22651312%2Fapple-pledges-another-small-but-welcome-sum-to-racial-justice" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;revealed at least $35 million would be invested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UezQqT"&gt;Still, it’s notable that Apple’s still sending significant sums towards racial justice at all, when an expert we quoted last year suggested that companies might turn their attention elsewhere when the moment fades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkWXhT"&gt;Cash also isn’t everything. There’s also institutional change to consider. Also: “It’s not just about where you’re going, but it’s also about owning up to where you have been, and how you may have contributed to a situation that exists right now, and that the wealth and prosperity of your business could be rooted in, is likely rooted in, some deep-seated inequities,” Laura Morgan Roberts, a professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, told us last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just banned a pay equity Slack channel but lets fun dogs channel lie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JWVCQwr9uJNoWOPcE2IibS19BNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799661/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esd1Pe"&gt;Apple has barred employees from creating a Slack channel to discuss pay equity. A member of the employee relations team, Apple’s version of HR, said that while the topic was “aligned with Apple’s commitment to pay equity,” it did not meet the company’s Slack Terms of Use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIofAS"&gt;“Slack channels are provided to conduct Apple business and must advance the work, deliverables, or mission of Apple departments and teams,” the employee relations representative told employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yw7RUv"&gt;The company’s rules for the in-office chat app say that “Slack channels for activities and hobbies not recognized as Apple Employee clubs or Diversity Network Associations (DNAs) aren’t permitted and shouldn’t be created.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fy9v7"&gt;But that rule has not been evenly enforced. Currently, Apple employees have popular Slack channels to discuss #fun-dogs (more than 5,000 members), #gaming (more than 3,000 members), and #dad-jokes (more than 2,000 members). On August 18th, the company approved a channel called #community-foosball. The cat and dog channels are not part of official clubs, and all of these channels were specifically created to talk about non-work activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3HsKp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A clear cut act of retaliation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkWApN"&gt;Employment attorney Vincent P. White says that invoking the Slack terms may simply be an excuse to block discussions of workplace pay disparities since doing so outright would violate labor law. “Discussing pay equity is a protected activity under federal, state, and local law,” says White. “Everyone agrees on that. For them to try and impair employees’ ability to discuss pay equity and diversity in the workplace is a clear cut act of retaliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpAc4Z"&gt;Pay equity has been a hot topic among Apple employees over the past few months. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;shut down multiple employee surveys&lt;/a&gt; aimed at gathering data on how much workers make. One survey, started by Apple engineer Cher Scarlett, has seemingly been allowed to stay up. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22633141/apple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap"&gt;early analysis of the results&lt;/a&gt; showed a 6 percent wage gap between the salaries of men and women who participated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWD00m"&gt;Now, organizers want to create a space for employees to discuss pay issues. While Apple previously said it did not have a pay equity problem, employees are suspicious. The company’s recent behavior, including shutting down pay surveys and now banning a pay equity Slack channel, has only exacerbated those concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P26x2q"&gt;“It sure is very convenient for Apple that these Terms of Use that they wrote are extremely useful for crushing free and open communication among employees,” one source says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgBDEg"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Apple Watch may be delayed due to manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Dip8joi6vMbZfwteRY8D3OW2vg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799013/vpavic_200929_4216_0137.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y7rr4A"&gt;The next Apple Watch is experiencing manufacturing issues that could lead to the product being released later than expected, according to separate reports from &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Watch-production-delayed-as-engineers-wrestle-with-quality-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-31/apple-s-new-watch-will-likely-be-delayed-over-production-snags"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The potential delay is reportedly due to complexities in the smartwatch’s new design, which is rumored to include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;flat sides and bigger screens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te1ypv"&gt;Sources told &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; that small-scale production for the next Apple Watch had begun but that it encountered “critical challenges in reaching satisfactory production performance.” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported similar details. Production has now been “temporarily halted” while Apple and its suppliers work to solve the manufacturing issues ahead of eventual mass production, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AiXY9p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The next Apple Watch is expected to be called the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Se0EIi"&gt;The new Apple Watch, expected to be called the Apple Watch Series 7, will see screen size increases to 41mm and 45mm (a 1mm bump from the currently available options), a faster processor, and “a flatter display and edges,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman reported &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;in his Power On newsletter on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. While Gurman reported that the Series 7 won’t bring any big health upgrades “until at least next year,” &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports that the new Watch will add new features “such as blood pressure measurement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh9V18"&gt;Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 6 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21430844/apple-event-recap-biggest-announcements-watch-series-6-se-ipad-air"&gt;at an event last September&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is expected to host another September product event this year. Given these reported production challenges with the next Apple Watch, if Apple does host a September event, there’s a possibility the Apple Watch might not make an appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZL4Ty"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moment’s new video-coloring app Grain will let you take handcrafted presets to other apps </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gkFzLvUouOGyEtDhngfRZIvvxZc=/326x0:3770x2296/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798634/grain_press_color_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VScVpG"&gt;Moment &lt;a href="https://apps.shopmoment.com/grain"&gt;is launching another video-focused app&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone and iPad Tuesday that lets you edit and color footage as well as create video presets or “looks” for use on social media or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147761/moment-rtro-video-app-retro-filters-stories-ios-iphone"&gt;Moment’s other video app, Rtro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ9Q30"&gt;The app is called Grain, and based on my experience with it in beta form, it seems to offer a lot of video settings to get lost in. Grain breaks its editing options into three categories: color, effects, and overlays. Color has a variety of preset filters to start with, like LoFi, 35mm, or Blockbuster, which you can then further customize with adjustments to color temperature, brightness, or saturation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IY0oSC"&gt;Effects and overlay presets work similarly. You can add film grain, light bleeds, blurs, VHS effects, faux film stocks and fine-tune them with granular controls. Grain also offers gestures to add or remove filters, but I quickly forgot they were an option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5_vQw8PzbC4WV8cyO8t4-YbNu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808038/Grain_App_WebRes399.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grain offers granular control over individual effects, including more professional-grade tools like color wheels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tQy84I"&gt;As someone who is at best an amateur videographer, the amount of control you can have over an individual video clip can be daunting. Luckily, Grain is designed for as much or as little experimentation as you want. You can produce something interesting just by selecting a color filter and a video effect without diving into menus for fine-tuning. (Though you could arguably just as easily do too much that way.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cFlcCyTWnffTwqAogCsm4AIdDGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808040/Image__2_.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots of my own disastrous attempt at coloring a clip of my dog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2sRtL"&gt;Video presets you create can be saved for later use or exported as a LUT (Lookup Table) for use in professional desktop software like Adobe Premiere Pro. Grain can also send your presets to Moment’s other video app, Rtro, if you prefer your modified presets to the filters Moment sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYi2xo"&gt;The catch with Grain is that to get all of the features, you have to be willing to pay. Grain charges $4.99 per month, $29.99 per year, or a one-time payment of $69.99 to unlock advanced color editing tools, unlimited video length, and the ability to export LUTs and overlays. Otherwise, you’re stuck with the basics, and the novel ability to send filters to Rtro. Moment also plans to bundle subscriptions to Grain and Rtro for $6.99 per month or $39.99 per year if you like both apps enough to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The makers of the GorillaPod made a MagSafe tripod mount</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Joby GripTight tripod mount" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r_NSg1BizLHuuko7dtawyAsKDP4=/1x0:3939x2625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798383/griptightmount.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Joby&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CF95F3"&gt;Joby has released a MagSafe mount for tripods that should simplify the process of attaching an iPhone 12 and any future iPhone models that support MagSafe. The new GripTight mount allows for quick attachment, letting the mount hold on to your phone either by just its MagSafe magnet or with a more secure option that tightly grips the edges of your phone like Joby’s previous smartphone mounts. With the latter use case, people may not know that you’re partially connected to the GripTight mount with MagSafe, but at least you’ll know it in your heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8d4i2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjoby.com%2Fus-en%2Fgriptight-mount-for-magsafe-jb01752-bww%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22650174%2Fjoby-gorillapod-tripod-wall-mount-magnet-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This new mount is available now for $23.97 from Joby’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and it works on the company’s line of flexible GorillaPod tripods as well as any other tripods that support the industry standard 1/4-20-inch thread. The clamp can rotate 360 degrees so that you can switch between portrait and landscape shooting modes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Joby GripTight wall mount" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gH_htMQ-oB-ZKGQirrfXPWbbtr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817056/griptightwallmount.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Joby&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g5HH5B"&gt;Additionally, the company announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjoby.com%2Fus-en%2Fgriptight-wall-mount-for-magsafe-jb01754-bww%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22650174%2Fjoby-gorillapod-tripod-wall-mount-magnet-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the GripTight MagSafe wall mount that costs $14.97&lt;/a&gt;. One side sticks to your iPhone 12 via the MagSafe magnet, while the other side has a sticky surface that lets it fasten to flat nonporous surfaces, like glass. Joby says you can restore its stickiness by rinsing it with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yu9Zzj"&gt;Support for MagSafe as a means to charge phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;hasn’t really picked up in a huge way&lt;/a&gt;, but at least more accessory makers like Joby and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608012/otterbox-magsafe-compatible-gaming-clip-xbox-controller-price-iphone-12-mini-pro-max"&gt;OtterBox&lt;/a&gt; have devised ways to take advantage of the magnet within each of Apple’s latest iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue bulbs are discounted in the lead up to Labor Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R3vJKoffF5qGEIip7f4lbqb77CI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69797568/Philips_Hue_E26_smart_bulbs_press_image.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Now through September 12th, you can buy three Philips Hue bulbs for the price of two.  | Image: Philips&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lQJKuv"&gt;The upcoming Labor Day holiday signals the end of summer and the ramp-up of everything from the school year to new gadget season. While you can expect to get plenty of Labor Day-related deals from us coming very shortly, Philips has gotten a bit of a head start with their “Summer of Hue” savings promo, so you’re not stuck with having a single shade of lighting after Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAhEvs"&gt;Right now, Philips is offering three &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750589459180759559#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white and color smart bulbs &lt;/a&gt;for the price of two, shaving $35 off the cost of some of the most popular smart home lights through September 12th. The vibrant E26 Hue bulbs allow for funky lighting while offering a full spectrum of 16 million colors, as well the flexibility to stretch from a warm white to daylight-balanced cool white with up to 800 lumens of brightness. As the fall months come around, it can be refreshing to have color temperature options at your disposal to try and keep your mental state up, or at the very least to have adjustable smart timers for when the daytime hours get shorter. This is a great way to get into the Philips Hue ecosystem — the E26 bulbs can work with a Hue Bridge or without one via Bluetooth — or build up the stock of lights already set up in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sLBJMs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Philips Hue gets a sleeker new app rebuilt ‘from the ground up’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465734/philips-hue-app-update-rebuilt-grid-view"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="mwF6P4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10649409"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TuGrn6"&gt;The world of gaming-focused accessories is flush with excessive RGB lighting, over-engineered aesthetics, and hard-edged design lines. If you’re looking for more subdued styling that doesn’t sacrifice performance, however, there’s the Logitech G Pro wireless mouse. The excellent peripheral has all the tenets of a gaming mouse, including a lightweight build and customizable DPI sensitivity, but with a look that could pass in either an esports tournament or an office. Its functionality extends a bit further, too, by allowing fully ambidextrous control, with a symmetrical design and swappable side button layouts. Normally $130, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GCKQD77?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; currently has the Logitech G Pro for $85, its cheapest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EAyinz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10726674"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W7Rzyk"&gt;The Studio Buds are a recent release from Apple-owned Beats, one that offers some unique features that separate it from the bevy of AirPods on the market. First off, the bold-colored Beats utilize a USB-C charging port as opposed to Lightning, making them more accessible and useful for Android users. They also support various Android features and offer active noise cancellation, which, while not as strong as the competition, still renders them a great pair of true wireless earbuds for working out or traveling. Amazon currently has the stylish &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SSCV5K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red model for $130&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off), which is a historical low for pair of earbuds that just launched in June. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Speyns"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10693512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D7zmHR"&gt;If you’re looking for another deal on true wireless earbuds, the Jabra Elite 75t are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more than 33 percent off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $100. These earbuds are a great alternative for multi-device users, or those who want some low-end punch while listening to tunes. They’re not as new as the aforementioned pair of Beats, but upon review, our colleague and seasoned headphone aficionado Chris Welch called them the best AirPods alternative. Considering the current price, the Jabra Elite 75t are a formidable competitor to standard AirPods and will make life a little easier if you’re someone who prefers to avoid Apple’s ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lfqwzf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kyuIx1"&gt;The original Apple Pencil became the butt of many jokes across the tech space when everyone saw how it charged — we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;weren’t a fan&lt;/a&gt;, either. Thankfully, unlike the first-gen model, the latest Apple Pencil charges when magnetically attached to your iPad. It also supports gestures and is compatible with both the iPad Pro and the latest iPad Air. If you took advantage of our still-active &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/8/30/22648127/ipad-air-apple-gigabyte-aero-15-sony-wh1000xm3-headphones-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deal from yesterday on the iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;, then this is your stylus of choice. For a limited time, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1WWBJK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is knocking $30 off the second-gen Apple Pencil, bringing it back down to its lowest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="56WqB4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZlbQ6Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="81k7rK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google must allow developers to use other payment systems, new Korean law declares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6vtfjWbmqr8esuAJJkmBtb-Xlvc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69796907/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="blzh29"&gt;South Korea has passed a bill written to prevent major platform owners like Google and Apple from restricting app developers to built-in payment systems, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-apple-hit-in-south-korea-by-worlds-first-law-ending-their-dominance-over-app-store-payments-11630403335?st=dh3dbi4h20et6lc&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The bill is now expected to be signed into law by President Moon Jae-in, whose party championed the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIrgCu"&gt;The law comes as a blow to Google and Apple who both require in-app purchases to flow only through their systems, instead of outside payment processors, allowing the tech giants to collect a 30 percent cut. If tech companies fail to comply with the new law, they could face fines of up to 3 percent of their South Korea revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNYI55"&gt;The law is &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210824010651320"&gt;an amendment to South Korea’s Telecommunications Business Act&lt;/a&gt;, and it could have a large impact on how Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store do business globally. South Korea’s National Assembly passed the bill on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GoDypm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neither company is happy about it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BuinVx"&gt;Neither company is happy about it. In a statement, Google defended its service fees, which it says “helps keep Android free,” and gives developers “the tools and global platform to access billions of consumers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQ4yQH"&gt;“Just as it costs developers money to build an app, it costs us money to build and maintain an operating system and app store,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ll reflect on how to comply with this law while maintaining a model that supports a high-quality operating system and app store, and we will share more in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cakKxF"&gt;A representative from Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;However, prior to the law’s passing, the company sent over the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WQK7nh"&gt;The proposed Telecommunications Business Act will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases, and features like “Ask to Buy” and Parental Controls will become less effective. We believe user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this proposal—leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WiFTPR"&gt;Lobbyists for the two companies have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/technology/apple-google-south-korea-app-store.html"&gt;reportedly argued to American officials&lt;/a&gt; that the Korean legislation violates a trade agreement, as it seeks to control the actions of US-based companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ie3QNX"&gt;South Korea isn’t the only country that’s trying to bend American tech giants to its will. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334641/apple-follows-russian-default-apps-law-setup-screen-options-user"&gt;Russia requires that gadgets come pre-installed&lt;/a&gt; with apps made by Russian developers, and  &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-considering-new-laws-apple-google-wechat-digital-wallets-2021-08-30/"&gt;Australia is looking into regulating services&lt;/a&gt; like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Some in the US government have even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;proposed legislation similar&lt;/a&gt; to what was passed by South Korea. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes that South Korea’s new legislation could end up being referenced by regulators in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnA8Nj"&gt;Both Apple and Google have been trying to stave off such actions through changes to their store policies. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;introduced its App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;, which halved Apple’s cut from developers earning less than a million dollars a year on its store. It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;agreed to let developers&lt;/a&gt; inform their users about payment options outside the App Store, using the email addresses that users gave them. Google said that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;only take 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; of developers' first million dollars instead of 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfkiI9"&gt;Both Apple and Google have faced legal challenges despite the changes, with the most notable coming from Epic Games. Epic argued that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; used their dominant positions to dictate what could and could not be done with their phones. While Epic’s argument is different against each company, they share the same core complaint: Apple and Google’s dominance over the app stores. Both cases are still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYAzT8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 31st, 7:21AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added new statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13’s rumored satellite link sounds like it’s just for emergencies</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dqc8Bg"&gt;Apple plans to let you connect your iPhone to satellites so you can contact emergency services in areas that don’t have cellular coverage, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/apple-plans-to-add-satellite-features-to-iphones-for-emergencies?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to a new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;article was published after Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Sunday that the iPhone 13 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647252/the-iphone-13-5g-leo-satellite"&gt;may be able to make satellite calls&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo often reveals details about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/17/18682820/apple-5g-iphone-2020-oled-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18228861/apple-iphone-kuo-rumor-ipad-ipod-touch-airpower-airpods"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; before the company officially announces them, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; sources indicate that Apple’s approach for iPhone satellite connectivity may be more limited to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYJAg9"&gt;One feature, called Emergency Message via Satellite, will let you text emergency services and emergency contacts when you don’t have a cell signal by harnessing a satellite network, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. These messages will have a length limit and be represented as a grey bubble instead of the green used for SMS messages and the blue used for iMessages. And when you’re sending one of these messages to an emergency contact, it will reportedly push through even if they have Do Not Disturb mode turned on, which could help ensure that your message is seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4cpaQd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New emergency reporting features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S15bkM"&gt;Another feature will let users report emergencies. “The phone will ask what kind of emergency is happening, such as whether it involves a car, boat, plane or fire,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. You’ll also be able to send information such as your location and your Medical ID (which you can set up in the Health app). You may also be able to notify emergency contacts at the same time you report an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1E08p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the next iPhone might have the required hardware to make satellite calls. But a source tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that the new features probably won’t be ready before next year, throwing cold water on the idea that you might be able to use them as soon as you buy the next iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ceva6Y"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OW6pDa"&gt;The new satellite link features, if they are released, could help ease fears about being able to contact emergency services in a time of need or when you’re away from a cellular network. There’s also the possibility the features could provide another way to get in touch with emergency services in the event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494652/911-outage-centurylink-lumen-intrado"&gt;of 911 outages&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17515464/att-911-emergency-outage-fine-fcc-2017"&gt;do&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/17/8990735/t-mobile-17-5-million-911-outages-fcc"&gt;happen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8244041/fcc-verizon-911-outage-fine"&gt;occasionally&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple sets debut date for The Problem with Jon Stewart</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JP8DGGuBmuuoZ5nblDg7Z1ekIYc=/13x0:1344x887/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794793/Screen_Shot_2021_08_30_at_11.26.44_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B9KmDa"&gt;Apple’s upcoming show starring Jon Stewart, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, will debut on Apple TV Plus on September 30th, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-announces-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-is-set-to-make-its-global-debut-thursday-september-30-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648861%2Fapple-tv-plus-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-show-premiere-debut-date-podcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-announces-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-is-set-to-make-its-global-debut-thursday-september-30-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648861%2Fapple-tv-plus-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-show-premiere-debut-date-podcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;describes the show&lt;/a&gt; as a “multiple-season, single-issue series, taking a deep dive on the issues affecting us most.” It will also have &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-problem-with-jon-stewart/id1583132133"&gt;a companion podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which will “extend the conversation from each episode.” New episodes of the TV show will premiere every other week, while new episodes of the podcast will be released weekly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Za6UJQ"&gt;Apple released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBMqejibrGg"&gt;a short teaser&lt;/a&gt; to promote the premiere date that features Stewart wondering, “what the hell happened to my face?” You can also listen to a &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-problem-with-jon-stewart/id1583132133?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1&amp;amp;itscg=80085&amp;amp;itsct=pod_show_appletv_tpwjs"&gt;teaser of the podcast right now&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s only 15 seconds long and doesn’t give us a great idea of what the podcast will actually be like. In July, Stewart promoted the upcoming show with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585674/jon-stewart-apple-tv-show-skit-roasting-space-billionaires-jason-alexander"&gt;an odd video skewering the billionaire space race&lt;/a&gt; that starred Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
