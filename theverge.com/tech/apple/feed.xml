  &lt;p id="g5VU3Q"&gt;It’s rare that Apple slashes the prices on its own products. Fortunately, other retailers are putting a lot of Apple products on sale for Black Friday. A bunch of retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Walmart, and Woot are slashing the prices on everything from wearables to its wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIuihu"&gt;Additionally, Apple’s direct website will mark down prices on several products beginning on Friday, November 27th, and running until Monday, November 30th. If you buy an eligible product during Apple’s Black Friday event, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583192%2Fapple-deals-black-friday-tech-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the tech giant will give you up to a $150 gift card&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcLyrb"&gt;Below, we have listed all of the best Black Friday discounts you can take advantage of if you are looking to buy any Apple device. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple head of security accused of offering iPads as bribes for concealed gun permits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad 5 sonny dickinson" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IgD5ED1mBhH3f-YTSdBRBRl-aqk=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866809/ipad5sonny.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvXHac"&gt;A California grand jury has &lt;a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/newsroom/newsreleases/Documents/2020NRDocs/CCW%20Indictments%20-%20Sung.pdf"&gt;indicted&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s head of global security on charges that he tried to bribe Santa Clara County officials to procure firearms (CCW) licenses, &lt;a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/newsroom/newsreleases/Pages/NRA2020/CCW-Undersheriff-Sung-.aspx"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;. Santa Clara district attorney Jeff Rosen alleges that Thomas Moyer offered 200 iPads — worth about $70,000 — to Capt. James Jensen and Undersheriff Rick Sung in the Santa Clara County sheriff’s office, in exchange for four concealed firearms licenses for Apple employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWyVgE"&gt;The charges came after a two-year investigation. “In the case of four CCW licenses withheld from Apple employees, Undersheriff Sung and Cpt. Jensen managed to extract from Thomas Moyer a promise that Apple would donate iPads to the Sheriff’s Office,” Rosen said in the news release. The iPads were never delivered, according to Rosen’s office, because Sung and Moyer became aware in 2019 that the district attorney was executing a search warrant for the sheriff department’s CCW records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRwiKj"&gt;Moyer’s attorney, Ed Swanson, said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that his client is innocent of the charges filed against him, adding he believed Moyer was “collateral damage” in a dispute between the Santa Clara sheriff and district attorneys’ offices. “He did nothing wrong and has acted with the highest integrity throughout his career,” Swanson said. “We have no doubt he will be acquitted at trial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdF7Lw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/apple-security-chief-accused-of-offering-to-bribe-officials"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Moyer has been at Apple for about 15 years and has been its head of global security since November 2018. He wrote a memo in 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;warning Apple employees&lt;/a&gt; about the potential consequences of leaking information to the media, which he wrote “can become part of your personal and professional identity forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2aXB6"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends deadline for requiring in-app purchases for apps selling online classes and events</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sls9lL"&gt;Apple on Monday announced &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=kw16tplo"&gt;an extension to its deadline&lt;/a&gt; for requiring in-app purchases for online events and classes offered within iOS apps to June 30th, 2021. Apple previously adjusted what types of events are subject to its in-app purchase policy and standard 30 percent cut back in September, with the original intention of requiring in-app purchases in all appropriate apps by December of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOgA4k"&gt;Apple cited the coronavirus pandemic, writing in a developer update posted to its website, “As the world fights COVID-19, we recognize that adapting experiences from in-person to digital continues to be a top priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y0dPqy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This deadline extension means developers have more time to temporarily reap the full profits of their sales&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XVXsTi"&gt;Requiring in-app purchase options for outside services like video streaming and exercise classes offered through iOS has been part of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business"&gt;the company’s policy&lt;/a&gt; for quite a while, but this specific change is focused on the adjustments made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455598/facebook-paid-events-apple-ios-30-percent-fees-waived"&gt;following Facebook’s September complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s issue was framed around event organizers losing out on much-needed money for their digital events offered through the Facebook app during COVID-19, because of Apple’s 30 percent in-app purchase commission. Apple decided to waive the fee till the end of the year, and the company adjusted its policy to focus on group events and classes to keep one-on-one experiences free from Apple fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vcUBs"&gt;This deadline extension means developers have more time to incorporate in-app purchases in their apps where applicable and to temporarily reap the full profits of their sales. Apple’s other recent App Store changes suggest it’s inclined to make some concessions, whether because of pressure from developers or regulatory scrutiny from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;on-going legal battle with Epic&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;anti-trust investigation in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLdR73"&gt;The best example is Apple’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;. Any developer making under $1 million in sales per year will be able to apply next year and if approved receive a reduced 15 percent App Store commission. Other companies like Amazon have negotiated such exemptions, albeit in back room deals rather than public battles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;Amazon Prime Video is able to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; with a reduced 15 percent Apple commission and sell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;in-app purchases and rentals&lt;/a&gt; without being forced to use Apple’s in-app purchase option. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze will soon support CarPlay’s split-view dashboard mode </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NaOh4tV63SAzV49sMyc9ixD94fI=/45x0:765x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845961/waze_carplay_split_view_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MxuQD5"&gt;Waze is finally coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18693555/apple-ios-13-carplay-interface-update-hands-on-test-review"&gt;Apple CarPlay’s new multiscreen dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. This is sure to come as welcome news to devotees of the Google-owned navigation app, who have been waiting for over a year for it to work with the much-improved, upgraded version of CarPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoA1EQ"&gt;A tipster who is beta testing the new feature sent us this image of Waze operating in CarPlay’s new Split View function. Apple rolled out the new dashboard as part of last year’s iOS 13 software update, but it was limited to only work with Apple Maps at the time. Previously, CarPlay required bouncing between different screens to see a track name while getting directions to a destination. With Split View, you can see a map, what’s currently playing on the car’s stereo, and the next piece of guidance to your destination all in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkicLT"&gt;Apple eventually released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194115/carplay-dashboard-third-party-map-support-ios-apple"&gt;iOS 13.4 earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, which introduced the option for third-party companies to add support for the dashboard mode on their own mapping apps. It took Google until August 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358978/google-maps-carplay-dashboard-mode-update-support-directions"&gt;implement support for Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;. And now it seems like Waze (which is also owned by Google) is soon to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sI35hT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 13’s best upgrade is in your car","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18693555/apple-ios-13-carplay-interface-update-hands-on-test-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BmWO7M"&gt;A spokesperson for Waze wouldn’t confirm the beta testing, so we’re not sure when the navigation company plans to officially announce the rollout. “We actually don’t have anything to share right now. Will be sure to keep you posted if/when we do,” the spokesperson said in an email. Waze has 140 million monthly active users who drive more than 24 billion miles (40 billion kilometers) every month. The company was founded in Israel in 2008 and was later acquired by Google in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNMc2j"&gt;The beta also features the first support for lane guidance in Waze for iOS, the tipster said. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437960/waze-lane-guidance-traffic-notifications-google-maps-features-amazon-music"&gt;This handy feature&lt;/a&gt; recommends what lane you should be in when you’re entering or exiting a freeway, for instance. It’s also helpful when navigating complicated intersections or highway mergers. The tipster described the ability to use Waze in CarPlay’s new split-screen dashboard as “really smooth” and a “game-changer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqPuXF"&gt;Like many companies, Waze has been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has emptied roadways around the world and sent many cities into lockdown. As sheltering in place and working from home become the new norm, fewer people are using Waze for their daily navigation needs. Fewer eyeballs on the app means less advertising revenue for the company, which led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428907/waze-layoff-pandemic-google-navigation-driving"&gt;Waze laying off 5 percent of its global workforce&lt;/a&gt;, or around 30 people, in September. More recently, the company’s CEO Noam Bardin announced that he would be &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/waze-ceo-noam-bardin-to-leave-company-in-early-2021/"&gt;stepping down in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6Z1yX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple TV remote has yet another alternate option that includes buttons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LWsJVe4yAZowA-QjHWTT8fIsNrQ=/0x71:1440x1031/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67840072/uei_remote.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universal Electronics new remote is for Apple TV&lt;/em&gt; | Universal Electronics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhEt5t"&gt;Universal Electronics Inc. (UEI) has introduced its version of the notoriously unpopular Apple TV remote “specifically developed and designed” for cable, satellite, and MVPD  (multichannel video program distributor) customers, &lt;a href="https://www.uei.com/press/2020/11/20/universal-electronics-inc-to-launch-apple-tv-remote-control-for-mvpds/"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmcekl"&gt;The remote uses Bluetooth low energy or infrared to connect with the box, has a microphone to speak commands to Siri, and its universal remote function allows control of TVs and audio devices from any brand or manufacturer. It has backlit keys, which activate via an ambient light sensor, a button to flip through channels, and a mute button, according to UEI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uTFoG"&gt;“We’re excited that customers worldwide will soon be able to enjoy this new remote, designed specifically for the growing number of MVPDs offering Apple TV 4K to their subscribers,” said Paul Arling, CEO of Universal Electronics, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dl5Ass"&gt;Universal isn’t the first company to introduce an Apple TV remote alternative; last year, Swiss TV and internet provider &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/9/21002605/apple-tv-remote-salt-swiss-tv-company-replacement-buttons-normal"&gt;Salt developed a remote&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with Apple after the touchpad controls on the native remote proved frustrating for users used to having standard buttons. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332433/apple-tv-remote-buttons-function-salt-siri-streaming-box-controller-price"&gt;Function introduced its Button Remote for Apple TV&lt;/a&gt; in July. The Salt model has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332433/apple-tv-remote-buttons-function-salt-siri-streaming-box-controller-price"&gt;difficult to buy&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrWHO3"&gt;UEI’s remote will be available beginning next year, but consumers won’t be able to buy the remote directly from Universal. The company plans to sell branded versions of the remote directly via the cable companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fq4pgE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoQ9WM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest teardown from iFixit shows how huge the iPhone 12 Pro Max camera is</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctoKDZ2fyt0fyi4Fs4Ns0IZ7Btk=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67839634/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has an enviable camera&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is Apple’s biggest iPhone ever, with a 6.7-inch display that boasts a camera system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;our reviewer called&lt;/a&gt; “one of the most confident smartphone cameras.” In its latest teardown, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fifixit.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F21%2F21588664%2Fapple-iphone-12-pro-max-teardown-ifixit-camera#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt; shows how big this impressive camera actually is compared to other iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7CJLcRZjqLg6Fj0KNzy1UKDp2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22064774/iphone_pro_max_12_camera.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max camera is quite large&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SrEDMF"&gt;The primary wide-angle sensor “dwarfs the iPhone 12’s sensor,” iFixit says, coming in around 47 percent larger. But it has the same 12 MP resolution as the smaller model. The 12 Pro Max’s sensor-shift image stabilization system— found on most DSLR cameras— adds bulk to the large main camera, iFixit found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pu0uma"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXjDFdNVnXo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0Zdbb"&gt;The 12 Pro Max’s L-shaped battery is the largest among all current iPhone models, weighing in at 14.13Wh, compared to the 8.57Wh in the mini and the 10.78 Wh in the 12 and 12 Pro. But iFixit notes that’s actually slightly smaller than the 15.04Wh pack found in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro Max. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GprY-JuSf5E6QLdwOI52IYPtyIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22064775/iphone_12_pro_max_battery_l.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max battery (right) dwarfs the other iPhone 12 model batteries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iRSQ2j"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max —the most expensive iPhone on the market right now starting at $1,099 — “is arguably Apple’s finest iPhone-related achievement this year,” iFixit says. The device adds “demanding 5G tech with no obvious compromises to other components.” Check out &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPhone%2B12%2BPro%2BMax%2BTeardown%2F138640%3Fvgo_ee%3D3bheJeT%252FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%252BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F21%2F21588664%2Fapple-iphone-12-pro-max-teardown-ifixit-camera#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit’s full teardown&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 12 Pro Max here. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vo5w1S"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563821/vergecast-podcast-430-apple-iphone-mini-pro-max-m1-chips-macbook"&gt;Last week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the crew spent some time discussing Apple’s announcement of new Mac computers with its own Arm-based processor chip, which Apple is calling the M1. This week, &lt;em&gt;Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn got their hands on the new &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OEaKQ0pxQsg"&gt;MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with the M1 chips&lt;/a&gt; for review and brought their findings to this week’s episode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpzz3D"&gt;Nilay and Dieter also bring in deputy editor Dan Seifert and editor Chris Welch to discuss their experiences with the new computers in regards to performance, battery life, and running iOS apps on macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RsaTui"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7961322068" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6vJ1Ec"&gt;But before they got into all of that, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; starts the discussion with an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/walt-mossberg-verge"&gt;legendary tech reviewer Walt Mossberg&lt;/a&gt;, who was able to try out the new MacBook Air for himself. Walt gives his first impressions as well as some background behind what he calls “one of the most seminal products of the last 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAAt31"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a lightly edited excerpt from that conversation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="119csa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nilay Patel: We have obviously just reviewed the new MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 chip, and you have had one as well. I’m dying to know what you think of this sort of major internal change to the Mac even though the outside kind of looks the same. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrWw2g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walt Mossberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so I just want to say one thing first: I actually believe that the MacBook — which you know and I know was the thing that the Windows guys were trying to copy for years and years — doesn’t get enough credit for being one of the seminal products of the last 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Leg23"&gt;I mean, it’s not as seminal as the iPhone or the first Android phone or whatever. But it was a seminal product because light, thin laptops tended to be cramped before the MacBook Air, and there were a lot of compromises. And the MacBook Air also kind of almost tied — I think it maybe was a month before one of the ThinkPads — in having an SSD. There were a bunch of things about it that were notable. And then the 2010 one was a huge improvement, and then the 2013 one, ironically, given what’s happening now because of an Intel chip — the Haswell chip at the time — which was specifically meant to give a huge leap in battery life. &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130618/power-testing-can-two-new-laptops-really-last-all-day/"&gt;I got in my test. I looked it up&lt;/a&gt;. I got 12 hours on it, and they were only claiming 10 different battery tests, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f0yAo"&gt;So I think the MacBook Air is a really important consumer tech product. And I think this one is — I mean, I agree with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Dieter’s review&lt;/a&gt; — I think it’s sort of amazing. I mean, we’ve all known they were going to do this. I’m no chip expert, processor expert, but from what I can understand, they’ve pulled off something amazing in a relatively short time. And by that, I mean it takes a long time to develop a processor. It’s not like doing some other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CVBFn"&gt;So in my use of this, I think the single thing that has impressed me most, the battery life has impressed me. I’ve not plugged this in in about 36 hours, and I have 75 percent battery life. So that’s fantastic. It’s buttery smooth. It’s fast as can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsqQZi"&gt;But the thing that really impresses me is their translation layer. This thing called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304182/apple-arm-mac-rosetta-2-emulation-app-converter-explainer"&gt;Rosetta 2&lt;/a&gt;. They had a Rosetta when they made another processor change some years ago. And what it does is it takes apps that have not been written for this processor that were written for the Intel — which is most of the third-party apps so far — and it runs them. And I got to tell you, they run fast. They run normally. I mean, fast. If you were doing a blind test and you didn’t know this was originally written for Intel, still written for Intel, and it was running through this Rosetta thing, you would never know it. At least that’s been my experience. I don’t know if it’s been yours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XplDlN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter Bohn: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, no, completely. To me, that’s one of the most impressive parts. Maybe if you were staring at how many times it bounced in the dock when it launched for the first time after reboot or something, you might be able to tell the difference. But otherwise, just exactly the same. And it’s my understanding that they co-developed this processor hardware with Rosetta 2 in mind and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdORax"&gt;So I think part of what’s happening here is this whole thing where Apple says we are able to integrate hardware and software that makes our stuff really special — sometimes that seems like a true claim, and sometimes it seems like it’s more marketing than reality. I think in this particular case with Rosetta 2, it’s absolutely reality that I don’t think their translation software would have worked as well if the chip team didn’t know it was coming and they didn’t know what was on the chip. My hunch is there’s some sort of thing inside the M1 chip that is just there just to make Rosetta fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The MacBook Air is once again the benchmark by which other laptops will be measured</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-4uEh9X7cshW17YWgigLDXnU4XU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67822415/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1246841126"&gt;Last week I wrote that Apple seemed “astonishingly confident” in its new M1-based Macs. This week we know why: they are astonishingly good. I reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, Nilay Patel reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and Chris Welch reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;new Mac mini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7PZie"&gt;All three are equally impressive, but it’s the Air in particular that stands out as offering incredible power at its price point. I’m also impressed with battery life. And the fact that Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer doesn’t cause slowdown or bugs for legacy apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUnrCn"&gt;Wins all around, then. Not very often that happens in consumer tech! The webcams are still terrible and there are lots of questions about what will happen with the &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; pro Macs we will start seeing in the next couple of years. But rather than constantly look ahead to the next thing, just for a moment, enjoy: a tech company made a big promise that it could do a hard thing and then did that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ei2Ae0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9028921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="06pKVn"&gt;Okay, moment’s over. Sorry. I want to pay a little more attention to one point Chaim Gartenberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;made when writing about the importance of these computers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="V9Ujaf"&gt;The most exciting — or frightening, if you’re a traditional PC chip company — part of Apple’s new chips is that the M1 is just the starting point. It’s Apple’s first-generation processor, designed to replace the chips in Apple’s weakest, cheapest laptops and desktops. Imagine what Apple’s laptops might do if the company can replicate that success on its high-end laptops and desktops or after a few more years of maturation for the M-series lineup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf2CVF"&gt;It’s not difficult to divine the future of Intel and even Qualcomm’s roadmap — they are consistent (and consistently dull) in their year-over-year improvements. Their customers are phone and laptop makers, so they need to be clear and transparent about what’s up. And I don’t see either pulling a step change like the M1 out of a hat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVIeH0"&gt;By contrast, we really have no idea what Apple’s chip roadmap looks like. We can make educated guesses based on what we would expect from the current chip and Apple’s philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPX9uE"&gt;We do know, however, that Apple is remarkably stable in its Mac product lineup. It doesn’t introduce a ton of different models. Different people could count differently, but I think there are eight distinct Macs that Apple sells: the Air, the entry level 13-inch MacBook Pro, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the Mac mini, the iMac (two sizes on this one), the iMac Pro, and the Mac Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWnU0t"&gt;I’m listing them all out to make a point: if you’re familiar with Macs, you have a sort of inherent idea of what those computers are, relative to each other. That’s the other way we can perhaps predict what’s next for Apple silicon. For example, we know how much more powerful an iMac is than an Air, on a rough basis. But now with the Air, the baseline for that rough basis has just been radically improved. So if the Apple silicon-based iMac continues to be as big a leap over the M1-based MacBook Air as it has been in the past, look out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iV3RL"&gt;But even if that doesn’t happen, PC makers have a problem &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;. So let’s come back to right now. Apple has a thousand-dollar laptop that beats the pants off anything else in its price class, and so every Windows ultrabook is going to be compared to it for the foreseeable future — and may likely be found wanting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdkuaT"&gt;We have a running joke at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that our old colleague Joanna Stern (now at the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;) would end every Windows laptop review with “for a hundred dollars more, you could get a MacBook Air.” For the next year or two, we all might be ending reviews of thin and light Windows laptops with something like “for the same price, you can get a MacBook Air that’s faster, lasts longer on a battery, and doesn’t have a fan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHpGGV"&gt;Do Intel, Qualcomm, AMD, Microsoft, Dell, HP, Asus, Razer, or anybody else in the PC ecosystem have something that will start chopping clauses from that sentence? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="95iQtT"&gt;
&lt;p id="yHwK0C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A brief programming note — I’m taking the next week off and may allow myself to be a a little intermittent in sending newsletters in December. I appreciate you all reading and hope you are staying safe this Thanksgiving holiday — and always. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6N59YR"&gt;Apple news that isn’t so good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1246793702"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple will pay $113 million for throttling older iPhones in new ‘batterygate’ settlement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Sean Hollister:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="o5HqYe"&gt;The settlement (PDF) hasn’t been fully approved by a judge yet, but there’s a chance states might see their money sooner than actual iPhone owners. If you applied for your $25 worth of the $500 million class-action settlement, you probably did so in July, but the process is still underway. There’s a fairness hearing on December 4th that’ll decide whether the settlement was handled properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cjUsum"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple will reduce App Store cut to 15 percent for most developers starting January 1st&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; So this is a win for smaller developers, but I do think that a million dollars is kind of a low cap for a small business (costs add up fast!). One thing to note, though, is that this probably isn’t costing Apple much — the vast majority of its App Store revenue comes from bigger fish. Bottom line, though, is that it seems Apple is finally reacting to public pressure and the threat of regulation. Nick Statt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gb1MC9"&gt;The new App Store Small Business Program, as it’s called, will allow any developer who earns less than $1 million in annual sales per year from all of their apps to qualify for a reduced App Store cut of 15 percent, half of Apple’s standard 30 percent fee, on all paid app revenue and in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1246839674"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573109/epic-tim-sweeney-apple-app-store-fee-cut-reduction-criticize"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple’s biggest App Store critics are not impressed with its new fee cut for small developers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Tim Sweeney is not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ys40iX"&gt;Gaming news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dsQUXr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service launches on iOS as a web app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I am conflicted about this! On the one hand, I like the idea of more people realizing that the web is a viable app platform. On the other, I hate hate hate that it’s happening because of Apple’s ridiculous App Store policies. One thing Nick Statt notes: this technically means &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is back on iOS, via this particular workaround.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHdIZT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Stadia is coming to iOS officially as a web app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Quite a day for web apps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ww126U"&gt;Google says it has been building a progressive web app version of Stadia that will run in the mobile version of Apple’s Safari browser, similar to how Microsoft intends to deliver its competing xCloud service on iOS sometime next year. But Google intends to beat Microsoft to the punch with public testing of its version in the coming weeks. Nvidia also announced today that it a beta web app version of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service on iOS is available today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1246838996"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMD Radeon RX 6800 review: entry-level 4K&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Sean Hollister makes a good case for the entry-level GPUs being better than you might expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1246792661"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Stadia survived a year, but its future depends on games like Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Nick Statt on the state of Stadia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rBjScY"&gt;But the key going forward will be moving beyond the “it’s good enough” strategy that has gotten Stadia to where it is now. That means convincing a prospective buyer of a game like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; to buy it on Stadia and not one of the half-dozen other platforms it’s available on. That scenario represents Google’s biggest and most pivotal challenge going forward. It’s made only harder by the launch of next-gen consoles from Microsoft and Sony, with the Xbox Series X / S and PlayStation 5 offering many of the same (and in some cases, better) load times and performance benefits Stadia touted last year without any of the compromises of using a streaming platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1246793474"&gt;Google news&lt;/h2&gt;

And the methods by which Google collects the information it needs to enable all those features are all private and secure — but it’s very difficult to worry that they someday won’t be either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mpKYZ3"&gt;Google has announced that it’s finally beginning to enable a key privacy feature: end-to-end encryption. For Android users who use Android Messages, one-on-one chats will eventually be end-to-end encrypted by default, meaning neither carriers nor Google will be able to read the content of those messages. Even though encryption is only beginning to roll out to people who sign up for the public beta for Android Messages, turning on encryption for RCS is a very big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He says it looks nice in person. I’ll take his word for it, as it’s not so great in pictures. Will be curious to see which companies decide to pick this up and offer it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yEXm89"&gt;Intel is launching a new laptop. Yes, that’s right, Intel itself has a new laptop that it designed in-house and will be selling through various partners early in 2021.

It’s just super refreshing to use a photo editing app that isn’t loaded down with all the conventions (and unnecessary features) of Photoshop. Pixelmator feels much more modern to me, even though it’s not quite as powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

I have to say I didn’t expect I’d miss big fun popcorn blockbusters movies as much as I do. Excited for them to come back and even more excited to make my own damn popcorn, at home. Julia Alexander:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LSNnHW"&gt;Unlike Mulan, &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; won’t cost anything extra beyond the monthly subscription fee. HBO Max subscribers will have the opportunity to watch the film directly from home. The streaming service costs $14.99 a month. The move comes as uncertainty grows over whether theaters will remain open as cases surge across the United States. Even if they do remain open, however, it’s uncertain whether people will actually attend screenings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>iFixit teardown shows just how similar the new M1 MacBooks are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/841b5LQdsBO7RPsmnwijpupBWr8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67821990/FxeSiyYSpBwt6keG.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7u4RN6"&gt;iFixit has gotten its hands on Apple’s new M1-powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which of course is to say that its team has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F46884%2Fm1-macbook-teardowns-something-old-something-new&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F20%2F21579016%2Fapple-m1-macbook-air-pro-ifixit-teardown#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;torn the laptops apart to find out what’s inside&lt;/a&gt;. And, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Air&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Pro&lt;/a&gt; have set groundbreaking new standards for performance and efficiency, it turns out that this can be attributed almost entirely to the M1 chip rather than any particular design changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0ksH4"&gt;Take the new MacBook Pro, for instance. Here’s this year’s Intel-based model on the left, with the new M1 version on the right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XkXf4R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9590898"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KnynVu"&gt;The internal layouts of the two computers are almost identical. iFixit notes that the M1 model uses exactly the same fan component as its Intel predecessor, for example, which really does drive home the M1 chip’s efficiency considering the difference in noise levels between the two computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6YXw0"&gt;The MacBook Air, meanwhile, also looks very similar to the Intel version, but with the omission of the fan altogether. iFixit expressed a little surprise that the design of the Air and Pro didn’t converge more, considering the computers now use identical processors, but Apple’s design focus here was clearly on using the M1 as a drop-in replacement for its existing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHNZ6b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F46884%2Fm1-macbook-teardowns-something-old-something-new&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F20%2F21579016%2Fapple-m1-macbook-air-pro-ifixit-teardown#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Check out the full teardown at iFixit for more&lt;/a&gt;, including a closer look at the M1 processor itself, a complete list of other chips the team found inside, and thoughts on the laptops’ repairability. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="lYPWYc"&gt;Apple has released iOS 14.2.1 with a number of fixes, including for one that the company says will address problems with the lock screen becoming unresponsive on the iPhone 12 mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLiVuu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt; was officially released on Friday, but users reported sensitivity issues with the lock screen &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/14/iphone-12-mini-lock-screen-touch-issues/"&gt;shortly after&lt;/a&gt;. Some users had problems swiping up from the bottom of the lock screen when trying to unlock their phone as well as issues pressing the flashlight or camera buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hg8W5m"&gt;It’s unclear exactly what caused the lock screen problems, and I haven’t run into any on my iPhone 12 mini that I got on Friday. Apparently, Apple found something it could fix, though, and hopefully this update resolves the issue for those who were having problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAx7bu"&gt;Apple says that iOS 14.2.1 will also fix issues with some MMS messages not being received and addressing sound quality issues with some Made for iPhone hearing devices. If you want to download and install the update right now, you should be able to access it from the Software Update menu in the Settings app. (I’ve already fully installed the update on my device.)&lt;/p&gt;
