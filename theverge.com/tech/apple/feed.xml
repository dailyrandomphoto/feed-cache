    <title>Google’s latest Nest Hub display is nearly half off</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s latest Nest Hub is on sale today for just $59.99, its second-best price to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ip6mXW"&gt;If you were secretly hoping for a smart home display for Christmas but didn’t receive one, today you can treat yourself to one of the best for almost half its usual price. Right now, you can grab Google’s second-gen Nest Hub — our pick for one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;best smart displays&lt;/a&gt; — for its second-best price to date at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1629831-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01331_us_nest_hub_2_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865019%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-apple-watch-series-7-wacom-one-airtag-loop-lg-a1-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglklYIiBv6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1181395/1036?subId1=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga01331us.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $99.99, it’s currently on sale for $59.99, which is only $10 shy of its all-time low during Black Friday. As mentioned in our review, Google’s small second-gen smart display remains an excellent digital photo frame for displaying images from Google Photos, and it offers automatic and reliable sleep-tracking features. It’s also a better speaker than its predecessor and grants you access to Google Assistant’s full suite of features. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="r49OiG"&gt;We’re four days into 2022, and if you’re starting to struggle with your New Year’s fitness resolutions, 1) welcome to the club and 2) today’s Apple Watch Series 7 deal may be just what you were looking for. For those still resolved to get healthier this year, you have another chance to snag Apple’s latest smartwatch for its lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is once again selling the 41mm, GPS-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 in green with a matching Sport Band for $339 instead of $399 after briefly offering the same discount two weeks ago. The Apple Watch Series 7 offers a larger, edge-to-edge display than its last-gen counterpart, along with IP6X dust resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gFFySg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OfP5UO"&gt;On the other hand, if you’re more the type of person who prefers lounging around watching TV over going for a run, 1) again, welcome to the club, and 2) we’ve got a solid deal on a relatively inexpensive OLED. LG’s A1 OLED offers deep black levels, great color accuracy, and wide viewing angles, along with support for both Alexa and Google Assistant. It doesn’t offer the advanced gaming features found with the more expensive LG C1, like variable refresh rate and HDMI 2.1 ports, but if features don’t matter to you, this more budget-friendly OLED might be worth checking out. Right now, you can pick up the A1 in the 48-inch configuration at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164937252697%3Famdata%3Denc%253AAQAGAAAAkPb26u5XMepclSzddcMwulBMyRV7VoW7jhFGXzqcUALNBOfJF40hvardXAswI2hhBD%252FV9LwELQn5%252BpYRjH9OqNpRBcQRO4riIzygFfx%252BN1mdH588QsfiP1SZMz2OOdJxP7SlL7X1TehcgQQNos0bWwl0fLSgnZj%252FDLs22rdTUl7kLyufQSQ053Ou5CEXrYLMZQ%253D%253D%257Ctkp%253ABFBMxO2r1sRf%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3Dvergedeals010422%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865019%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-apple-watch-series-7-wacom-one-airtag-loop-lg-a1-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $846.99, or $849.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglGbOlG5KN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; instead of paying its original $1,199.99 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pYtoHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10959416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KIdKv3"&gt;Looking for a way to express your creativity at a discount? Wacom’s most affordable drawing tablet is now available for its best price to date. Geared toward entry-level artists and social media content creators, Wacom’s One Drawing Tablet &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082LZXQ6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $299.95 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $100 off of the typical listing price. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21028405/wacom-one-tablet-pen-display-android-price-macos-windows-ces-2020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hands-on impressions left us impressed&lt;/a&gt; with this tablet, namely its matte display, which felt great to draw on. The 13-inch, 1920 x 1080 HD slate is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS, as well as some Android tablets and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJuiNy"&gt;Additionally, the Wacom One comes with a pressure-sensitive stylus and limited-time access to various creative software services, including a two-month subscription to Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, along with six months of access to Adobe Fresco. Note, however, that the drawing tablet lacks support for USB-C, so you’ll need a dongle to connect it to newer MacBook models and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FyisAx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10959354"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvajca"&gt;Nintendo Switch owners can nab a complimentary 128GB SanDisk microSD card from Best Buy when they purchase an &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglmcaHay7K" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;annual family membership to Nintendo Switch Online for $34.99&lt;/a&gt;. The membership grants up to eight local Switch users access to more than 70 SNES and NES games, along with perks like online multiplayer, exclusive offers (like access to purchase one of the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-64-controller.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard-to-find wireless Nintendo 64 controllers&lt;/a&gt;), and cloud storage for game saves. SanDisk’s bundled microSD card, meanwhile, gives your Switch an extra 128GB of storage, so you can store more games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Schlage announces first Apple Home Key-compatible smart lock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i66y4veI_-UCewosbPTB3Dnares=/0x72:4171x2853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345536/Schlage_Encode_Plus_with_home_keys_phone_TaptoUnlock__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Schlage Encode Plus is the first Apple home key smart lock.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Schlage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BogEBd"&gt;At CES 2022 this week, lock manufacturer Schlage announced it is launching the first lock in North America to support Apple’s Home Key. The Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt is an updated version of the popular Schlage Encode WiFi smart lock, adding an NFC chip for the Home Key function, as well as a Thread radio to support HomeKit over Thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3m5d9"&gt;Home Key, introduced with iOS 15, lets you store a digital door key in your Apple Wallet and lock and unlock your door by tapping your device on the lock, similar to how Apple Pay or Apple Transit works. The system uses the iPhone’s or Apple Watch’s NFC chip to authenticate a user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F0yh0"&gt;The Schlage Encode Plus will be available in spring 2022 for $300 (that Plus moniker comes with a $50 price hike from the original Encode). The Schlage Sense, a HomeKit-only lock that doesn’t support Home Key, is still available for $200.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1I2plVQ0OjwEWwwI_fu_WcNcHSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134609/Encode_Plus_CEN_Satin_Nickel_Front_Door__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schlage Encode Plus works with HomeKit, Alexa, and Google and doesn’t require a hub or bridge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pCb1Oo"&gt;The addition of Home Key gives the Encode a feature available on other door locks that so far it had been largely lacking — a hands-free way to unlock the door (if you use the watch option, that is). You can also control it with an app, a keypad, a regular key, and voice control using Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b76WbY"&gt;Home Key has two modes for unlocking: “Express Mode,” where you don’t have to unlock your phone, and “Require Face ID or Passcode,” which adds the step of authenticating with Face ID or Touch ID. If you lose your phone, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210515#markaslost"&gt;enabling Lost Mode through Apple’s Find My feature&lt;/a&gt; will disable all elements of your Apple Wallet, including Home Key. If your phone battery is dying, you can still unlock the door with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20991458/apple-pay-express-transit-london-tfl-feature-available"&gt;Power Reserve feature introduced in iOS14&lt;/a&gt;. It works in the same way it does with Express Transit mode, functioning for up to five hours after the red Power Reserve icon appears on an Apple Watch or iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RuHQv"&gt;Home Key also brings with it the option to manage access keys in HomeKit, so you can have different codes for different folks. A nice feature for families is that once you set up Home Key on your device, every member of the household who is part of your Apple Home automatically has the key added to their wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6aj6bmUukeqwtTnT3gXqoPN_MsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134807/Schlage_Encode_Plus_with_Apple_home_keys_Watch_TaptoUnlock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schlage&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When paired with home key, the Schlage lock can be controlled using just your Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dNDpcy"&gt;The Schlage Encode retains the same exterior design and all the existing features of the non-Plus version and integrates with Google and Amazon Alexa smart home platforms for automations and voice control via the Schlage Home app. You can use HomeKit and the Schlage app simultaneously. As a Wi-Fi lock, it doesn’t require any separate hub or bridge for remote access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fk6Hn"&gt;However, the lock can be set up entirely in HomeKit if you prefer, although it requires an Apple Home hub (such as a HomePod Mini or Apple TV) for remote access in this configuration. The Schlage app also adds a few features not in HomeKit, such as scheduling access and a built-in alarm feature. “With this lock, we’re giving our customers the opportunity to use all the different features and integrations — Alexa, Google Assistant, as well as HomeKit,” says Donald Beene, senior product manager for Allegion (parent company of Schlage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z2iwcl"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt|105415" data-volume-uuid="35fe5e45e" data-volume-id="105415" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-483" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;This video produced by Schlage shows the Encode Plus in action.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dhsnYi"&gt;The lock is available in the same styles and finishes as the Encode: the more traditional Camelot design or the more modern Century option. The only physical difference is the addition of two NFC targets on the keypad screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kj7dIS"&gt;The Encode Plus uses four protocols, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and Thread. NFC has been part of Schlage’s commercial options previously, but this is the first time it’s used it in residential locks. There are a few other locks that currently support NFC; one is the Level Lock Touch, but Schlage is the first to come to market in North America with a Home Key-compatible lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4FbFw"&gt;The Thread radio supports HomeKit over Thread specifically, says Beene, and is Schlage’s first Thread-enabled product. The company is closely watching the developing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;, too. “The hardware is here for Matter,” he says. “This will be the first [lock] product with the hardware on board to support something like that, but we still don’t know where those tech specs will land.” Matter is slated to launch in mid-2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nuBXhrxnqWLUTLGTUG3zINky1wE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134824/Schlage_Encode_Plus_Century_in_Satin_Nickel_Exterior_x_Interior.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schlage&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schlage Encode Plus comes in two styles: the contemporary Century (above) and traditional Camelot (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yn75H4o2myz_VbPgYBxZeWYo7fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142274/Schlage_Encode_Plus_Camelot_in_Aged_Bronze_Exterior_x_Interior__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schlage&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Camelot and the Century will come in matte black, satin nickel, and aged bronze (pictured) finishes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="atWqYu"&gt;With all those radios on board, battery life could be an issue. With all-in use — i.e., if you connect the lock over Wi-Fi to the Schlage app and to HomeKit — the battery life is about four to five months, says Beene. Using HomeKit only, it jumps up to about a year, he says, but you will need an Apple Home Hub for remote access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3UWT9"&gt;The addition of Home Key and HomeKit compatibility makes the Encode Plus one of the most fully featured smart locks on the market (for iPhone owners, although Beene told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company is looking at bringing the NFC function to Android phones). August and Yale’s August-powered smart locks also have wide compatibility with smart home platforms and an auto-unlock feature that uses geofencing to control your lock as you approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHL6rO"&gt;My experience with August locks is that the auto-unlock feature is quite hit or miss. Home Key looks to be a more reliable way to easily unlock your door in a hands-free fashion. Currently, a fingerprint reader is my favorite way to unlock a smart door lock, but we’ll have to wait and see whether this will prove to be a more convenient option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCgEGO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vanv7k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlrZ6n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including ones equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult. It’s a slightly different story for the newer M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros, but any bit of savings you can get on the new Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;recently released macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; — but we strongly recommend opting for a newer model now that Apple has introduced its M1 chips across the MacBook Air and Pro lines. There is really no downside to opting for Apple’s own silicon, save for Windows Boot Camp holdouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac%2F2020-mac-mini-macbook-air-macbook-pro&amp;amp;subid1=vergemacbookdealsdecember2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, although in the past few months we’ve seen it discounted down to $799.99. The best deal at the moment, however, is only available at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5KWB9H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base model for $949.99&lt;/a&gt;. The 512GB model is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in select colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xStRiT"&gt;The MacBook Pro line has been split into two different segments — for the time being. The M1-powered MacBook Pro of 2020 remains the final Touch Bar holdout. It is a sibling to the MacBook Air, introduced at the same time, with similar innards, save mostly for a fan that allows it to run at peak performance for longer. The new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; last year, come with the M1 Pro or optional M1 Max CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Id2Hln"&gt;There are multiple variants of both models, however, we haven’t seen any noteworthy discounts on any configuration outside of Amazon’s $78 discount last month on the 14-inch base model. There are no deals available at the moment, either, though Best Buy will throw in some incentives when you buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggHmcuFlcg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;14-&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglodJJhkbP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;16-inch model&lt;/a&gt;, including six months of Apple Music, 15 months of Microsoft 365 for the price of 12, free security software, and a handful of other special offers. You can also get a discount when you trade in select devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KS0G3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"2021 MacBook Pros compared: how Apple’s laptops stack up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733406/macbook-pro-13-14-16-inch-m1-max-air-compare-specs"},{"title":"12 great apps ready for your new Mac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22814365/mac-best-apps-apple-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="h4rH4i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the latest MacBook Pro line were absolutely beaming with praise. Whether it was the beautiful display or the remarkable performance and battery life they exhibited, these premium laptops are investments that we can wholeheartedly recommend. As soon as there’s a price break on these impressive laptops, we’d suggest that anyone in the market for a new laptop consider purchasing one, as they’re likely to move fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oXGxIx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AOJENT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The Touch Bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the Air but geared toward slightly more demanding use cases, and starts at $1,299. The M1-powered base model includes 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. In mid-December, we saw the base model drop down to $1099.99, but right now, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LLDSG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604809-REG%2Fapple_myd82ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo are only selling it for $1,199&lt;/a&gt;. That may not be as steep of a discount, but that’s still a savings of $100. The larger, 512GB configuration with 8GB of RAM is also currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604810-REG%2Fapple_myd92ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo in space gray for $1,349.00&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. If you’re looking for a discount, both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon are selling the base model&lt;/a&gt; with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $649 ($50 off), as well as the 512GB variant for $829 instead of $899 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html%2FDFF%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple briefly crossed a $3 trillion market cap</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUabvvoSkfx96vZLhek6NKJjLLU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342842/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5VLcZu"&gt;Apple’s market cap briefly passed $3 trillion on Monday more than a year after it surpassed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;the $2 trillion mark&lt;/a&gt; and three years after eclipsing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17638764/apple-worlds-first-1-trillion-company-market-cap-stock-price"&gt;$1 trillion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Hhyj"&gt;Apple’s huge success is due in large part to the iPhone, which revolutionized the smartphone industry and remains a cash cow for the company. But Apple continues to see strong momentum in its other businesses as well, with its services and Mac divisions reporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;all-time highs in its Q4 2021 earnings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCrPC4"&gt;Shortly after hitting the $3 trillion milestone at around 1:45PM ET, Apple’s market cap dipped below it again. Apple’s market cap must be above the $3 trillion mark when the market closes at 4PM ET for it to officially be designated as the first publicly-traded company with that valuation, and it ended below $3 trillion on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvSXK3"&gt;Apple isn’t the only company in the trillion-dollar club; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value%5D"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;Google parent company Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515623/microsoft-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; all have market caps exceeding $1 trillion. (Facebook parent company Meta breached the $1 trillion milestone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554502/facebook-1-trillion-dollar-market-cap-company-business"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; but is currently sitting below it.) In recent years, Apple has also jostled with others for the crown of the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. It passed Saudi Aramco &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;in July 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though it was overtaken for a time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753251/microsoft-apple-market-cap-business-valuable-company"&gt;by Microsoft in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oQ9fq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 3rd, 4:36PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Apple’s market cap ended the day below $3 trillion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Apple HomeKit bug can send iOS devices into a death spiral </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nTqYAp00NgK0PiuWRv3U86YWtgM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342714/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ia3g4y"&gt;You should always be wary of invites to a stranger’s Home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djTWM3"&gt;That’s the upshot of a new piece of security research that has found a vulnerability capable of locking iOS devices into a spiral of freezing, crashing, and rebooting if a user connects to a sabotaged Apple Home device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8v4KJ"&gt;The vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trevorspiniolas/status/1477185285784051712?s=21"&gt;discovered by security researcher Trevor Spiniolas&lt;/a&gt;, can be exploited through Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/"&gt;HomeKit API&lt;/a&gt;, the software interface that allows an iOS app to control compatible smart home devices. If an attacker creates a HomeKit device with an extremely long name — around 500,000 characters — then an iOS device that connects to it will become unresponsive once it reads the device name and enter a cycle of freezing and rebooting that can only be ended by wiping and restoring the iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="idDwXd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the most likely way to trigger the exploit would be through a spoof Home network&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRvaRh"&gt;What’s more, since HomeKit device names are backed up to iCloud, signing in to the same iCloud account with a restored device will trigger the crash again, with the cycle continuing until the device owner switches off the option to sync Home devices from iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVIby9"&gt;Though it’s possible that an attacker could compromise a user’s existing HomeKit-enabled device, the most likely way the exploit would be triggered is if the attacker created a spoof Home network and tricked a user into joining via a phishing email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdVMO8"&gt;To guard against the attack, the main precaution for iOS users is to instantly reject any invitations to join an unfamiliar Home network. Additionally, iOS users who currently use smart home devices can protect themselves by entering the Control Center and disabling the setting “Show Home Controls.” (This won’t prevent Home devices from being used but limits which information is accessible through the Control Center.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHQzpH"&gt;Spiniolas &lt;a href="https://trevorspiniolas.com/doorlock/doorlock.html"&gt;released details on his personal website&lt;/a&gt; on January 1, 2022. He was &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT209600"&gt;previously credited by Apple&lt;/a&gt; for discovering a vulnerability in macOS Mojave that was patched in 2019. The new vulnerability affects the latest iOS version, 15.2, and goes back at least as far as 14.7, Spiniolas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QorAC"&gt;Spiniolas also accused Apple of being slow to respond to the initial disclosure, which was made months before the public release. The researcher shared emails with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that appeared to show an Apple representative acknowledging the issue and requesting Spiniolas refrain from publishing details until early 2022. The blog post detailing the vulnerability claims that Apple was made aware of the issue on August 10, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvC0YM"&gt;“Apple’s lack of transparency is not only frustrating to security researchers who often work for free, it poses a risk to the millions of people who use Apple products in their day-to-day lives by reducing Apple’s accountability on security matters,” Spiniolas wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UWFLY"&gt;Apple had not responded to a request for comment by time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OiCFczPA_I9r0afqJmI7VaxiOk=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342687/MN6U3_AV1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b6AkUG"&gt;Apple is now selling a new set of special edition AirPod Pros (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/01/apple-launches-special-edition-tiger-airpods-pro-for-chinese-new-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;via 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in time for the Chinese New Year, which begins on February 1st, 2022. Just as the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218360/apple-lunar-new-year-ox-airpods-pro-asia"&gt;Year of the Ox&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is engraving a special emoji on the AirPods Pro case — this time, themed for the Year of the Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6XzHM"&gt;At first glance, it seems like only the standard tiger emoji is featured on the case — but turns out, it’s just a bit more snazzy with sparkles and fireworks surrounding the tiger face topped off with a cute tiger growly-face hood. Other than that, the only other difference is the retail box has the same emoji in red on the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New special edition Year of the Tiger AirPods on the left comparing to AirPods Pro with a regular tiger emoji on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tprz5U"&gt;The new Special Edition AirPods Pro - Tiger (the official name) is available to order now in several Asian markets, including Hong Kong (with a heavy backorder until May 1st as of writing), where it retails for HK$1,999 ($256.38 USD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCXc4c"&gt;Apple also is &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4720927805801613"&gt;giving away&lt;/a&gt; free red envelopes with a golden embossing of different Chinese zodiac emojis — all wearing the same tiger hood. It’s a cute addition for those traditionally gifting money for the celebration of the new year but is only available if purchased in an Apple Store that sells the special edition AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pyp3H"&gt;While people in markets like the US might feel left out — you could just order regular AirPods Pro and get a free tiger emoji engraving... it’s really not that different. The existence of these yearly special editions is perhaps a literal product of courting the Chinese market — a country in which Apple historically has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423347/apple-freedom-speech-expression-information-china-censorship-policy"&gt;bend&lt;/a&gt; to stay competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirPods Pro 2 may come with lossless audio support and a charging case that makes sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k2MZr9hKJFLErqLATTZzsy5XyxE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70338848/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i6y4qD"&gt;The second-generation AirPods Pro may support Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC), and could even come with a case that makes a sound to help you find it, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in a note to investors seen by &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/01/02/airpods-pro-2-charging-case-trackable-like-airtag-may-come-with-health-sensors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/02/kuo-airpods-pro-2-to-offer-lossless-support-new-form-factor-more/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aogMFl"&gt;There currently isn’t an AirPods model that supports lossless audio, a form of file compression that preserves all of the data in the original audio file, resulting in higher quality sound. Each AirPods model — even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;pricey AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; — uses Bluetooth to deliver audio, which limits the devices to using Advanced Audio Codec (AAC), a lossy form of audio compression. Thus far, the only Apple devices that can take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;lossless audio on Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; (and elsewhere) include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV 4K, and Apple HomePod. The main downside to lossless audio is that its files take up more storage space on your device, and streaming it online can quickly eat up mobile data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dZtNl1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gdZRpc"&gt;If the AirPods Pro 2 does support ALAC, Apple will either have to ditch Bluetooth or jump over some of the technology’s hurdles to accomplish that. The limitations of Bluetooth were brought up in &lt;a href="https://www.whathifi.com/features/is-bluetooth-holding-back-apples-airpods-we-asked-the-man-who-made-them"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Hi-Fi’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s recent interview with Gary Geaves, the vice president of acoustics at Apple. During the interview, Geaves said the company will need to work hard to get the most out of Bluetooth technology, and also noted that “there’s a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth,” but “more bandwidth” would be ideal — a potential hint of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERAT6V"&gt;As for the possibility of a charging case that emits sound, this may help you find your case if it’s ever separated from your AirPods — right now, only the AirPods themselves make a noise when you try to locate them via the Find My app. Also noted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;, Kuo predicts that the AirPods Pro 2 could sport a redesign and may have a focus on fitness, something that was &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458155/new-airpods-pro-2022-fitness-release-dates-report-design-features"&gt;previously rumored by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Kuo says that Apple may release the AirPods Pro 2 in the fourth quarter of 2022, about three years after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;release of the first AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new ad invites you to imagine dying alone without a Watch on your wrist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EsscqcojoVWyol0sEAfxmpAttbo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336936/maxresdefault__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cx6aL7"&gt;Apple wants you to know that buying a $400 smartwatch could be a matter of life-and-death — and it’s brilliantly, gruesomely captured that feeling in a new TV ad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJXVSP"&gt;Titled “911,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ2JiwEARFo"&gt;the one-minute ad spot&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t show any of the gory details — you simply hear three phone conversations between 911 operators and people who managed to use their Apple Watch when facing seemingly imminent death: one who might drown in a sinking car, one who fell a great distance and broke his leg, and a paddleboarder who got swept out to sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiOZiV"&gt;They each have a happy ending, Apple informs us: “With the help of their watch, Jason, Jim, and Amanda were rescued in minutes.” But the underlying message is brutally clear: if they didn’t have this miraculous life-saving product on their wrists, they could have died alone. Apple is well known for commissioning heartstring-plucking ads, and this one is no exception: it’s painfully easy to imagine myself bleeding out or drowning, with no help on the way, when I listen to their scared voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPI9Bg"&gt;I’m torn about this marketing, because it partially rings true. You don’t have to search long to find people who believe the Apple Watch genuinely saved their life. I nearly bought one for my dad a while back, believing it a small price to pay just in case it made a difference. (He declined; for one thing, he’s on Android.) Even though there are other smartwatches that could theoretically make emergency calls, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say an Apple Watch is the obvious choice, particularly if you believe the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936113/apple-watch-emergency-sos-fall-detection-set-up-how-to"&gt;fall detection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702151/apple-watch-heartbeat-irregular-pulse-afib"&gt;irregular heartbeat flagging&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"&gt;walking steadiness indicator&lt;/a&gt; might also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ff3a22"&gt;But that doesn’t change the fact that Apple is now selling you on &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;, edging into shady insurance salesman territory to do so. It’s a good ad, but it feels a little shameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0wCqeo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new health features bring new focus to elder care technology","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"},{"title":"Apple is bringing car crash detection to the iPhone, says the Wall Street Journal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757102/apple-iphone-car-crash-detection-feature-onstar"},{"title":"The Apple Watch heart monitor sends too many people to the doctor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"},{"title":"Apple Watch Series 7 review: time and time again","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Ussr4T"&gt;Besides, the feature Apple’s showing off here is still &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;phone call — something you can also do with a phone. This is an optional, pricey gadget you have to remember to put on your wrist, compared to the phone that every Apple Watch customer already owns and keeps on their person — except, perhaps, in the middle of a car accident or a paddleboarding excursion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9brOLs"&gt;If I were in a life-or-death situation like these, would I really dial 911 from my watch? Perhaps I would, and be grateful. But I think it’s more likely I’d have my phone, rather than the Apple Watch that spends most of its time forgotten on my bedside shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TP2Sbu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest iPad is back down to its best price at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vo2gOGGE1IGPtSgWHuNEjeLfYdg=/0x0:1653x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333568/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Connect_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This year’s entry-level iPad is currently on sale at Amazon for $299.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0vvdG"&gt;It’s New Year’s Eve, and while that means we are very soon waving goodbye (and good riddance) to the year 2021, it just wouldn’t be special enough day without a selection of great tech deals from your friends at &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals. &lt;/em&gt;This has certainly been a jam-packed year full of, well, chaos, but also some great gadgets and worthwhile savings that help you save some coin along the way. While we can’t wait to bring you even more in 2022, let’s not get ahead of ourselves too quickly. Below, we’ll highlight some of the best deals for you in the world of tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeSa8V"&gt;Starting us off, there is no better bang-for-the-buck tablet on the market for most people than Apple’s latest base-model iPad. The 10.2-inch model mostly stands alone in terms of the price-to-performance ratio while also having such an expansive ecosystem of apps, accessory compatibility, and long-lasting support via software updates. Whether it’s mostly a Netflix-machine for your family or the main homework tool for a child, the base iPad is a workhorse that easily sells at its $329 entry price point. That is probably why we have seen such infrequent discounts this year, though we are now in luck. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the base 64GB Wi-Fi configuration for $299&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $30. If you’re in need of more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91TLNJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model has the same discount, knocking it down to $449&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAij75"&gt;While the latest iPad looks nearly the same as most models before it, its updated A13 Bionic CPU is much faster than its predecessor. Also, its front-facing camera now has Center Stage, to automatically follow you in the frame during video calls. How perfect, since it seems like our Zoom-centric ways will not change just yet for early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j1ogx2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="buw3it"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V30cJd"&gt;Looking for a little more than Apple’s entry-level offerings? The iPad Air is the mid-range option in Apple’s lineup — sitting well above the base model, but less costly than the iPad Pro options — and for many people it’s the Goldilocks of being “just right” in terms of power and features. The iPad Air features a speedy A14 Bionic processor and Touch ID fingerprint sensor combined with a 10.9-inch screen in a fairly compact footprint. It has all of the looks of the Pro models without the same heft in price. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229396/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F650223175&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today, you can get it from Walmart for just $539&lt;/a&gt;, which is $60 off its usual price of $599 for this base configuration with 64GB of storage and Wi-Fi radio. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k1HOa9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"10 Apple Arcade games for your new iPhone or iPad","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22815442/iphone-ipad-best-games-apple-arcade-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="79C9uF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lhwc1R"&gt;You’ve probably already heard plenty of “new year, new you” hyperbole, and unfortunately, that will continue to ring out well into January and February, but here’s a resolution you might have not considered: get better lighting. If you’re working from home or just spending a lot of time at your place during the long and dreary winter months, lighting can be a robust mood-enhancer. Nanoleaf’s Elements line of illuminated wood-look panels can brighten up a workspace and give a touch of warmth to an otherwise humdrum room. You can choose your desired pattern layout when you mount them, and customize the glowing effects to suit your vibe or mindset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV3JUA"&gt;Nanoleaf has been &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F31%2F22859709%2Fapple-ipad-air-tablet-nanoleaf-lighting-elements-shapes-sennheiser-momentum-headphones-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;running some great discounts across a variety of its products&lt;/a&gt;, though the Elements are our choice for the best deal around. You can get the a seven-panel starter kit direct from Nanoleaf or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjH49H9ggf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $70 off, bringing them to their all-time low price of $229.99. For additional coverage, a three-panel kit is $20 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjH54PK564" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; as well. Though time is running out on this deal, as it’s set to expire on New Year’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rSun4H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771267"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4zEcn1"&gt;Ready to close out 2021 strong? Here’s an idea. Get a great pair of noise-canceling headphones, and block out the rest of the world for a little while. I think that’s what most of us want to do with 2021, and let’s be honest, we owe it to ourselves. The Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones are tied for fourth place in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our list of best headphones for 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but they are without a doubt one of the most unique looking sets you can buy that back up good looks with quality sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fs2tuI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3MJBW8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the Momentum 3 Wireless in white for just $217.13&lt;/a&gt;, saving a whopping $182 off MSRP. These are an excellent set of headphones with a punchy sound, and they’re back down to their all-time low price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H9n6fK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3P8JqD"&gt;More deals that still won’t help you recall the words to &lt;em&gt;Auld Lang Syne&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="k9zAht"&gt;If you need some speedy external storage for a phone, tablet, drone, or Nintendo Switch, a Lexar 256GB 1066x microSD card is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GGCMT2Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$32.99 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($27 off).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8dhzLq"&gt;Logitech’s G335 wired headset could be described as an affordable, no-frills gaming headset, but it’s got some vibrant stylings to accompany its affordable price. The black model is just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KKBSDTY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$48.23 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (about $22 off). The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KKW2ZS2?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KKZ8S36?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; colorways are $49.99 each, and all of them feature colorful accents and a mic that mutes when you flip it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Apple investigates Indian iPhone plant after workers strike following mass food poisoning</title>

      &lt;img alt="Inside the Most Ambitious Push Yet to Make iPhones Outside China" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/duAksKd7Dq0aItXB58n0Pzc1OAg=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333312/1164608304.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foxconn’s Indian operation began assembling iPhones for Apple outside of China for the first time in 2021. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uvD0p2"&gt;Apple is sending independent auditors to investigate an iPhone assembly facility in India, after poor working and living conditions at the plant prompted workers to go on strike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CJZgU"&gt;The facility in southern India is operated by longtime Apple partner Foxconn. An &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/women-force-change-indian-iphone-plant-sick-bad-food-crowded-dorms-2021-12-30/?"&gt;investigation by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that women working at the plant were laboring in extremely difficult conditions, forced to sleep on the floor in crowded dorms and sharing toilets without running water. Recently, an outbreak of food poisoning left 150 individuals hospitalized, prompting workers to strike and shut down the plant on December 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCZsop"&gt;In response, Apple says it’s put the plant on “probation” (though the company hasn’t said what this means for Foxconn or the workers who assemble its iPhones). The plant employs some 17,000 people, and is located around 25 miles (40km) west of Chennai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sFxOlX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple: “Following recent concerns [...] we dispatched independent auditors”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lDvrIJ"&gt;A spokesperson for Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59818796"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “Following recent concerns about food safety and accommodation conditions at Foxconn Sriperumbudur, we dispatched independent auditors. We found that some of the remote dormitory accommodations and dining rooms being used for employees do not meet our requirements, and we are working with the supplier to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions are rapidly implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmzBUP"&gt;Foxconn apologized for poor conditions, and, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-29/foxconn-to-overhaul-india-management-after-labor-flareup"&gt;reported by the state government of Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, has agreed to upgrade its facilities — expanding living spaces, improving bathrooms, and providing drinking water. The company says it will resume work at the plant soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Odl2w"&gt;The news illustrates the difficulties Apple faces as it shifts production of its gadgets out of China. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-foxconn-india-apple-exclusive-idUSKBN24B2GH"&gt;reports in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone-maker has urged suppliers like Taiwan-based Foxconn to move production to other countries like India and Vietnam. This comes as Apple faces criticism at home for outsourcing manufacturing jobs, and pressure in China to accede to demands from the Communist Party regarding censorship and data access. Shifting production out of China gives other parties less leverage over Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3HnZn"&gt;Apple has been repeatedly criticized for the labor conditions involved in constructing its hugely profitable gadgets. Foxconn’s plants in particular have come under scrutiny for their &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract"&gt;sweatshop conditions and worker suicides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
