    <title>Sony now lets you use the DualSense pad to play PS5 on your nearby Mac, iPhone, iPad, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xn7yKyzSC-ZnTSHtZKmvKXzkscw=/0x212:2200x1679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69265140/20210510_Sean_Hollister_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TtiSeS"&gt;It’s a little-known fact that you can sling a PS5 or PS4 to another room of your house, streaming your games to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/1/11138016/playstation-4-remote-play-pc-mac-feature"&gt;Mac or Windows PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902406/sony-ps4-firmware-update-remote-play-android"&gt;iOS or Android device&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;or even an old PS4&lt;/a&gt; with Sony’s PS Remote Play app. But until recently, you could only remotely control your shiny new PlayStation 5 with the old DualShock 4 gamepad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dloisn"&gt;That’s now changing, as Sony has just announced the PS5’s new DualShock controller is supported &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pair-dualsense-controller-bluetooth/"&gt;across every Apple platform running the latest operating system&lt;/a&gt;, including iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Apple TVs running 14.5 and Macs running macOS Big Sur 11.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZlGGmR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Remote Play is now available using the DualSense wireless controller to play compatible games on a range of Apple devices. Full details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4fpa77oFqx"&gt;https://t.co/4fpa77oFqx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z2BlehDLjO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z2BlehDLjO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1391822847924973579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGsa9D"&gt;I just gave it a quick try myself with an iPhone 12 mini and a recent iPad Pro, and I have some thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUleMM"&gt;The good news: if the only controller you own is a DualSense controller, it totally works — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21547303/sony-ps5-dualsense-adaptive-triggers-haptics-teardown-featuresver"&gt;your awesome adaptive triggers&lt;/a&gt; come along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEuqyp"&gt;Here is some bad news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0ogOnp"&gt;There’s no haptic feedback. Absolutely zero. It feels extremely weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="izZOmp"&gt;Each time you want to switch devices (to your iPhone or back to your PS5), you’ll have to manually pair your DualSense again. That was true of previous pads as well, but I was hoping they’d fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QMN2GW"&gt;The built-in microphone, headphone jack, and speaker don’t work. The speaker is a serious loss — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;games like&lt;em&gt; Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;use it in combination with haptic feedback to add some serious immersion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HV1yCY"&gt;The streaming quality, as always, will depend heavily on your home wireless network. Give it a try, though; it’s free! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="o5EbHy"&gt;You’ll have to decide whether these things defeat the purpose of pairing a DualSense with an Apple device. As far as I’m concerned, I’ll keep my DualSense hooked up to the PS5 where it can actually help me sense things, and use a DualShock 4 (or third-party pad) when I want to stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sM77R2"&gt;It’s also more ammunition for the argument that we should be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352382/sony-ps5-playstation-4-controllers-new-ps4-support-games"&gt;play PS5 games on our PS5 with a PS4 pad&lt;/a&gt;. This is the second time Sony has shown that limitation is totally arbitrary: first when it allowed us to &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/you-can-play-ps5-games-with-a-dualshock-4-if-you-use-remote-play/'"&gt;control PS5 games with the PS4 controller over Remote Play&lt;/a&gt; to start, and now again with this signal that the DualSense’s sensing abilities are optional when streaming games over a network.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A special thanks to the person who combined the Apple TV remote and an AirTag</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5koe4"&gt;Here are a few unrelated facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aQ7mJV"&gt;Up until few weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;Apple was selling the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, one of the least popular (and most easily lost) remote controls ever made, with a slick glass and metal chassis that’s practically designed to slip behind a couch cushion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="urzuRn"&gt;Apple also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released its AirTag trackers&lt;/a&gt;, which use a Bluetooth network of Apple devices and local ultra-wideband tracking to help locate missing items, whether they’re across town or a few feet away in the room with you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G827Fn"&gt;The AirTag tracker has a small speaker, so you can find it buried in a couch or under a pile of throw pillows. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PLzRgk"&gt;Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;redesigned the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which it announced at the same event as the AirTags trackers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IT482B"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394335/apple-u1-uwb-locator-missing-ipad-pro-apple-tv-siri-remote"&gt;did not include&lt;/a&gt; a UWB chip in the new Siri Remote to allow users with recent iPhone devices to track said remote if they manage to lose it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u0lcDd"&gt;Apple is a company that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fcases-protection&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;produces cases&lt;/a&gt; for almost all of its products (including the iPhone, iPad, and AirTag tracker) — but not either iteration of the Siri Remote. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y0qE35"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208492"&gt;Apple’s official support document&lt;/a&gt; for “If you lost the remote for your Apple TV,” advocates that users either use the Apple TV remote function integrated into iOS devices or just buy a new one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eKO9Wj"&gt;My Apple TV remote is &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in my living room, and no, I don’t have any idea where it is. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="NGU6xw"&gt;With all that said, it’s no surprise that enterprising creators are already making 3D-printed templates for a case for the original Siri Remote that allows you to slot in both the remote and an AirTag tracker so that you can actually find it the next time you lose it in a couch. There are already &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=airtag+remote&amp;amp;type=things&amp;amp;sort=relevant"&gt;several available from Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F1015765067%2Fairtag-case-for-apple-tv-siri-remote%3Fgpla%3D1%26gao%3D1%26%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dshopping_us_e-electronics_and_accessories-electronics_cases-phone_cases%26utm_custom1%3D_k_Cj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIYcE9TPgLwISANYDJRm3pZGfmPwoOQTatroAzaz6kVfOLIPDoYLQNcaAjs9EALw_wcB_k_%26utm_content%3Dgo_1843970791_69629621997_346364498394_pla-352374535867_c__1015765067_12768591%26utm_custom2%3D1843970791%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIYcE9TPgLwISANYDJRm3pZGfmPwoOQTatroAzaz6kVfOLIPDoYLQNcaAjs9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Etsy store selling files&lt;/a&gt;, and even an enterprising &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F224454921320%3Fchn%3Dps%26var%3D523239022404%26norover%3D1%26mkevt%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-117182-37290-0%26mkcid%3D2%26itemid%3D523239022404_224454921320%26targetid%3D882300791467%26device%3Dc%26mktype%3Dpla%26googleloc%3D9003653%26poi%3D%26campaignid%3D1669934603%26mkgroupid%3D65058347419%26rlsatarget%3Dpla-882300791467%26abcId%3D1123856%26merchantid%3D6296724%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIaUm-mnPxWXR9m6x20Zn9U11qEZG6mxRRI2zzO51zF1CKHnRApJT8MaAuBzEALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay seller&lt;/a&gt; that’ll print and ship you one if you don’t have a 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ6vMH"&gt;To be clear, this is the lamest workaround for the fact that Apple didn’t just put a UWB chip and a tiny speaker in its $60 remote. It can’t be a cost thing: AirTags have one and they only cost $30. Roku has been putting tiny speakers in its remotes to make them easier to find for years. There was &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/29/siris-find-my-support-apple-tv-remote/"&gt;even a strange message&lt;/a&gt; in Siri that seemed to hint at the possibility of finding a lost Siri Remote using the virtual assistant — but Apple removed the message a few hours later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nuqmlO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I really &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; find my Apple TV’s remote&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ao5LvK"&gt;As such, I cannot explain why Apple has refused to embark down this mind-bogglingly obvious path. But I am puzzled why Apple isn’t making a nicer version of this exact 3D printed concept (ideally out of nicer, more durable materials that actually match the rest of the hardware and would be more enjoyable to use on a daily basis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbH7UO"&gt;Apple loves selling unnecessary hardware accessories (like its various AirTag keychain cases, which cost more than the AirTags and solve the self-inflicted issue of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;not having a loop built right into the device&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTzobV"&gt;For Apple, it’s a no-brainer to make a case (that adds functionality that Apple should have included right out of the box) that would almost certainly exceed the cost of the remote &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; require the additional purchase of a different Apple product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAWPhg"&gt;And yet, for all my mockery here, I really &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; find my Apple TV’s remote. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days, and in iOS 14.5, which is starting to roll out to the public today, there are new privacy features that may make you feel happier but are not endearing Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;The new feature is aptly called App Tracking Transparency. Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The new version of iOS allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you won’t have to do anything; you’ll be automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track, and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne1PGZ"&gt;(Note: At first, the App Tracking Transparency feature seemed to be misbehaving for some people; it either didn’t respond or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;the toggle in Tracking was grayed out&lt;/a&gt;. On May 3rd, Apple issued update 14.5.1, which was supposed to fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/03/ios-14-5-1-release-changes/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the fix hasn’t worked for some people; however, at least one staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that his toggle was no longer grayed out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 9:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a note about problems with the new feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4nwEG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 10th, 2:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note about issues with the new feature has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v9l0IJ"&gt;Several Apple suppliers may have used forced labor in China, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fseven-apple-suppliers-accused-of-using-forced-labor-from-xinjiang&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428899%2Fapple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Working with two human rights groups, the publication identified seven companies that supplied products or services to Apple and supported forced labor programs, according to statements made by the Chinese government. The programs target the country’s Muslim minority population, particularly Uyghurs living in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjTPW"&gt;Six of the seven suppliers were said to participate in work programs operated by the Chinese government, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports, which human rights groups describe as frequently offering cover for forced labor. Workers can be jailed for refusing to join the work programs, the report says, and those enrolled in the programs are often moved far from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl0OY3"&gt;One of the suppliers operated in Xinjiang, the region of China predominantly populated by Uyghurs and where the most egregious human rights violations &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/inside-xinjiang-detention-camp"&gt;have reportedly taken place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wL5Jyw"&gt;The companies supplied Apple with antennas, cables, and coatings, among other products and services, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glfQLl"&gt;Apple “found no evidence of forced labor anywhere we operate,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. Apple said it looks for forced labor as part of “every assessment” it conducts. “We will continue doing all we can to protect workers and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgJ34z"&gt;The problem is not Apple’s alone. The tech industry at large relies on suppliers in China, and &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports that these companies have also worked with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, among others. (Amazon and Facebook told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; they wouldn’t work with suppliers using forced labor; Google and Microsoft didn’t respond.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeynMT"&gt;China’s forced work programs have been &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html"&gt;getting more attention&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, with new reports speaking to the growing scope of China’s oppressive practices in Xinjiang. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; finding more than 100 detention facilities located beside factories.  In January, &lt;a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/determination-of-the-secretary-of-state-on-atrocities-in-xinjiang/index.html"&gt;the Trump administration said&lt;/a&gt; China was “committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcbbAE"&gt;Apple’s supply chain has previously been linked to forced labor in China. The Tech Transparency Project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;said a glass supplier&lt;/a&gt; was using forced labor in December; Apple said it had seen no evidence of forced labor. In March, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/shares-of-china-s-ofilm-drop-after-firm-loses-foreign-customer"&gt;cut ties with another supplier&lt;/a&gt; over allegations it was connected to coercive government labor programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple invests another $45 million in Gorilla Glass maker Corning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4n_Ay95t5IS-URje6SNzqrAFuA=/11x0:1949x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69261932/Apple_awards_Corning_an_additional_45_million_dollars_team_member_051021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corning manufactures glass for Apple and many Android device makers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PU0nfd"&gt;Apple is awarding Corning another $45 million investment from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund, in addition to the $450 million it’s already given to the US-based company over the past four years. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-awards-corning-45-million-from-its-advanced-manufacturing-fund%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428372%2Fapple-corning-45-million-investment-gorilla-glass-ceramic-shield-foldable-bendable-glass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the investment will “expand Corning’s manufacturing capacity in the US and drive research and development into innovative new technologies that support durability and long-lasting product life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFS5I0"&gt;Corning provides glass for a variety of Apple products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The two companies have a history &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687299/plastic-iphone-gorilla-glass-origin-story-steve-jobs"&gt;dating back to the original iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, they collaborated on the iPhone 12 lineup’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509008/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-mini-displays-ceramic-hardened"&gt;Ceramic Shield technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple claims is “tougher than any smartphone glass” and makes its latest flagships four times more resistant to damage from drops. As well as Apple, Corning’s Gorilla Glass is used in phones from &lt;a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/products-with-gorilla-glass/smartphones.html"&gt;countless Android manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; including Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uh0Yrf1t9rpNe1vgj3Ofrwsth9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19729421/corning_4k_bendable_glass.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corning’s ultra-thin glass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VmUHFo"&gt;Apple doesn’t say exactly how Corning will use the $45 million investment, but its timing coincides with &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/02/kuo-8-inch-foldable-iphone-2023/"&gt;recent reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple could launch a foldable iPhone in 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251328/apple-corning-foldable-display-gorilla-glass-bendable-smartphone"&gt;Back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; we heard Corning was developing a bendable version of its glass, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;last February&lt;/a&gt; the company said it expects devices using the technology to reach the market in 12 to 18 months. If it works, the glass could allow for durable foldable smartphones that don’t require a layer of plastic protection used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything"&gt;Samsung’s latest foldables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvSteK"&gt;“Today, when you buy a phone with Gorilla Glass, you’re touching glass … that’s what we’re working towards,” Corning said of its ambitions for bendable glass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Shortcuts is great, but it needs a notification toggle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DsBqG0T7o0mFVbpBHW1uyjVKZ4o=/80x0:2480x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69259235/shortcuts.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vTZsNM"&gt;Apple’s Shortcuts app is a fantastic piece of iOS, a nearly limitless corner of the operating system that lets users automate almost anything they can think of, limited only by imagination and ability to use Apple’s coding system (Federico Viticci’s comprehensive collection &lt;a href="https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt; is a great place to start&lt;/a&gt;.) But Shortcuts has an issue so awful it renders it one of the most annoying parts of my phone, instead of one of the most useful: Apple insists on always showing notifications when I do something, and it’s virtually impossible to turn it off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rp7Ah2"&gt;Yes, I am aware that there is an extremely janky hack for disabling notifications on Shortcuts on a global level. The trick, &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/722717/how-to-disable-notifications-for-the-shortcuts-app-on-iphone/"&gt;as detailed by &lt;em&gt;HowToGeek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, involves going to the Screen Time part of settings and toggling back and forth between weeks to trick the software into giving you access to the standard notifications menu for the Shortcuts app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2fZIr"&gt;There are a few issues with this, including the fact that it’s annoying to do, requires mucking around with what is almost certainly a glitch, and it’s extremely difficult to reenable notifications if you do disable them (since you’ll have to flip back to the last week you had notifications enabled in Screen Time to glitch back into the same menu). It’s also a global setting: you’re either all in on Shortcuts banners or completely disabling them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KONg7e3oMSfXUaALOweoq92I0YM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499393/Untitled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7SqjDg"&gt;Apple, I assume, mandates notifications because Shortcuts &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; extremely powerful tools for automating things on your iPhone, and it’s easy to imagine unscrupulous use of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hjOtK"&gt;But the thing is, the power of Shortcuts is to &lt;em&gt;automate&lt;/em&gt; things in the background that I don’t want to have to deal with, whether that’s automatically disabling rotation lock when I open or close an app, open an app with a custom icon, or &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90632845/this-clever-iphone-wallpaper-ensures-your-battery-will-never-die-again"&gt;change the wallpaper when the battery life is low&lt;/a&gt;. A big glaring notification every time I do something detracts from that idea. I want my phone to be quietly helpful, not shouting in my face every time it does what I asked it to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oAKrMW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to customize your iPhone’s home screen with widgets and app icons","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21448712/customize-iphone-home-screen-app-icons-widget-ios14"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GtZ3BL"&gt;My new favorite use of Shortcuts is the recently added ability in iOS 14.5 to automatically turn on and off rotation lock &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; when I’m in video playing apps like Apple TV Plus or YouTube. The Shortcut works amazingly, but it's marred by the fact that every time I open or close YouTube (or the other apps I have it configured in), I lose the top chunk of my screen to a notification alerting me that, yes, the phone is doing the exact thing I programmed it to do. (It’s a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; notification, too, often taking a few seconds before it goes away.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38QmjA"&gt;All I’m asking for is some middle ground. Apple doesn’t need to fully nuke notifications for Shortcuts. But the company could easily allow for specific automations to have the option to run silently in the background on a case-by-case basis — giving users the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0GOba"&gt;The ball’s in your court, Apple. And WWDC (with the presumed reveal of iOS 15) is just a few weeks away. Fingers crossed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In Epic v Apple, everybody is losing at the game of defining games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v6rP_07pLVGQ8lJPWdgw6kegrhc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69255433/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Is Roblox a game or not?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gtxVrE"&gt;If you have ever wanted to see a bunch of mumbly nerds struggle to define what constitutes a “game,” well, is &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; the trial for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pAOnA"&gt;What is the difference between an “app” and a “game?” This sounds like a stoner question but instead occupied a fair amount of the morning in Epic v. Apple. Roblox, explained Apple’s marketing manager Trystan Kosmynka, was an app. See, games have a beginning, an end, and challenges. “There’s experiences within Roblox that we did not look at as a game,” Kosmynka said. We did establish that Minecraft is a game, though, so that’s nice for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This screenshot of the App Store clearly shows that Roblox is classified as a “game” — despite what Kosmynka testified." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLdCxWBQjWfGbbE5HTUm8p4fD6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499994/Screen_Shot_2021_05_07_at_5.30.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot of Roblox on the Apple App Store, as of May 7 at 8PM ET&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7a5dp9"&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers did not understand this distinction and neither did I. But here’s the problem for Apple: if Roblox &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a game, then it’s fairly easy for Epic to compare Fortnite to it. Also, looking up Roblox in the App Store after Kosmynka testified, it is categorized as a “game.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYDWHr"&gt;Roblox is free, with in-app purchases. Since apparently no one can define what a game is, I can’t tell whether it’s fair to say that Roblox is a platform with games on it, but it sure looks that way when I log on. Scrolling through, there are a number of small squares where I can join a game, and each appears to have different rules. (The app calls these “worlds.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar2T1j"&gt;And when Kosmynka doesn’t get the category on Roblox right, well. That’s an own goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6ZQypK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve always looked at Fortnite as a game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky1rqQ"&gt;Anyway, Kosmynka noticeably shrank when Epic’s Lauren Moskowitz began asking questions on the redirect. Were Snapchat’s bunny ear filters games? What about TikTok challenges? (The manner in which this question was asked convinced me that I was possibly the only person in the room on TikTok.) Things got worse for Kosmynka during a speed-run of questions. Had he used Fortnite? Yes. Had he attended a concert there? No. “Fortnite is a virtual world where you build a character, correct?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UImbUr"&gt;“I wouldn’t refer to Fortnite as a world. I’ve always looked at Fortnite as a game,” Kosmynka replied. Had he done Battle Royale? Yes. Party Royale? No. Creative mode? No. He knew that Fortnite held concerts but didn’t know it streamed movies. In the context of “What is a game,” it made Kosmynka sound like he didn’t know what he was talking about. It was a tense, and rather devastating, line of questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAE7pG"&gt;At one point, Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she didn’t understand why Minecraft was a game and Roblox was not. (Again, per the App Store: Roblox is &lt;em&gt;absolutely &lt;/em&gt;a game.) She asked Kosmynka for an industry definition for a game. Turns out, there isn’t one — although, my colleague Adi Robertson notes, game developers and academics will happily talk you under the table about magic circles, meaningful choices, and the works of Johan Huizinga if you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nresF0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It seemed like Epic was attempting to establish that Apple is inconsistent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep3QIM"&gt;Later, Matthew Weissinger, VP of marketing at Epic Games, explained that Fortnite is a metaverse. “It’s one of the remarkable things about Fortnite, we’re building this thing called the metaverse, a social place,” he murmured softly. (All of the men we heard from today would benefit greatly from elocution lessons.) “One of the ways I’ve tried to explain it is, think about all of us in lockdown, and how we try to stay socially connected. Some of the most meaningful experiences I’ve had were logging into Zoom and we had our friends and parents and we celebrate grandpa’s birthday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLXukC"&gt;We also discover that Roblox has a “battle royale” mode, just like Fortnite. Honestly the question to me now is not &lt;em&gt;Is Roblox a game&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;Is Roblox a metaverse.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvpt6q"&gt;Throughout this line of questioning, it seemed like Epic was attempting to establish that Apple is inconsistent — and passing the buck. Kosmynka testified that developers get to pick what category they belong to, not Apple, making his Roblox digression even weirder. The Roblox thing made Apple look slipshod, and the further testimony about the App Store review didn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lRdIg"&gt;The process behind App Store review is unbelievably boring unless you are a developer who is trying to pass review. We went through it in &lt;em&gt;exhaustive&lt;/em&gt; detail. Apple gets 100,000 app store submissions per week, Kosmynka testified. But only 500 people actually do the “human review” — a lot of the rest of the work is automated. It’s impossible to judge how good an automated process is by listening to someone describe it in abstract in the courtroom. Kosmynka seemed confident when he was being questioned by Apple’s attorney, but when Epic got a crack at him, his voice got softer and softer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="v132mG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One of the problems with limiting competition is that you don’t get innovation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f5EWrL"&gt;We heard about apps Apple had mistakenly allowed on the store: ones that carried malicious ad fraud code, apps that copycatted Headspace, a “school shooting game,” a game of shooting cannons at protestors, several inappropriate apps (the funniest of which was “Ganja Farm: Weed Empire”) and more. In emails, Kosmynka said, “We are making critical errors.” In reference to the school-shooting game, Kosmynka said he was “dumbfounded at how this could be missed.” These specifics were more damning than the abstract walk-through of the app review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4jSsK"&gt;At one point, Judge Gonzalez Rogers wondered if anyone was doing better than Apple at app store moderation. Kosmynka punted on this answer. “One of the problems with limiting competition is that you don’t get innovation,” said Judge Gonzalez Rogers. “One of my concerns is that if you aren’t letting parties compete on these topics, things won’t improve.” She then asked if Apple hired third party reviewers. It does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1Ij7k"&gt;There is an implicit contrast here — the Epic Games Store. Steve Allison, VP and General Manager of the Epic Game Store, testified that there have been no known instances of malware or pirated content on the Epic Game Store, though there has been some fraud. It was hard not to notice the contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmwA1Y"&gt;Apple’s lawyer, who did not introduce herself, took us through an excruciating narration of the Epic Games website as part of her intensely chaotic cross-examination of Allison. I understand that a lot of things need to be narrated for the court record, but this was silly. We determined that there were a lot of games in the Epic Games Store. We also determined that there were 25 games in the “top 20” games section, which felt kind of bitchy. The first non-game app, Spotify, came to the store in December 2020. Fine, but this didn’t seem to make Epic look bad? Or at least, not the way she’d been hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QxHyvr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Are you aware that itch.io includes so-called adult games such as a game called “Sisterly Lust?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="413UDZ"&gt;She lingered on the store-within-a-store on Epic Game Store: Itch.io,a store for indie games that Epic added to its store in April. You can download itch.io’s store from Epic. “Are you aware that itch.io includes so-called adult games such as a game called “Sisterly Lust?” Apple’s lawyer asked. Some of the games on itch.io are “so offensive we cannot speak about them here,” she sniffed. This was a more successful line of argument — it essentially explained why Apple didn’t want stores within its own store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoXImk"&gt;Of course, the big contrast between the Apple App Store and the Epic Game Store was economic. The 30/70 split that Epic finds so objectionable began with retail — you used to have to buy games at Wal-Mart or GameStop or something, when they were physically packaged, Allison said quietly. As retailers moved away from PC games in favor of console games, Valve created Steam, which mimicked the 30/70 split from traditional retail — but it was viewed as an improvement among developers, since they didn’t have to pay for discs and packaging and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wPd2d"&gt;That is, until Minecraft self-published, in Allison’s telling. Then someone taking 30 percent looked steep. In 2018, Epic launched the Epic Games Store, which took only a 12 percent cut. (In order to assuage developers who might fear losing revenue from Steam when they took exclusive deals with Epic, Epic agreed to pay them a minimum guarantee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJ7DDu"&gt;Significantly, developers don’t have to use the Epic in-app payment system — they can use their own, meaning that Epic can theoretically get &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; money on in-app purchases. Wizards of the Coast, the publisher of Magic the Gathering Arena, and Ubisoft, with multiple titles, use their own payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="8GFI1t"&gt;Still, I find myself returning to the question that began the day: What is a game? It’s shocking to me that so many people who specialize in apps and games can’t really answer this question. But I guess in some sense, you could imagine the trial is one — it’s got a beginning, a middle, and an end. Lots of money at stake. A winner and a loser. Plus, when the verdict is appealed — as it almost inevitably will be — we’ll get a sequel. Sure, Epic played well today, but you need more than one good turn to win.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The autonomous vehicle world is shrinking — it’s overdue</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘The AV industry has promised too much for too long, and has delivered too little’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="30PAVY"&gt;After years of positive vibes about the future of autonomous vehicles and nearly unrestricted access to cash from Kool-Aid-drunk venture capitalists, the AV industry is confronting some hard truths. The first is that autonomous vehicles are going to take a lot longer to reach mass scale than previously thought. The second is that it’s going to be a lot more expensive, too. And the third hard truth: going it alone is no longer a viable option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGpFNZ"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404406/toyota-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-acquisition-amount-deal"&gt;Lyft sold its self-driving car division to a subsidiary of Toyota&lt;/a&gt; for $550 million. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331794/cruise-acquires-voyage-self-driving-car-merger"&gt;Cruise bought Voyage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;Aurora merged with Uber’s autonomous vehicle unit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-acquires-autonomous-trucking-startup-ike/"&gt;Delivery robot startup Nuro acquired self-driving truck outfit Ike&lt;/a&gt;. There have been so many mergers, joint ventures, and various tie-ups lately it can be difficult to keep them all straight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jdlfYW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It can be difficult to keep them all straight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vnWQC"&gt;Where that leaves things is a little unclear. There is still money flowing to these companies, and nearly all of the executives, engineers, and software developers working on the technology remain bullish about the future. But there is a growing sense among experts and investors that the heady days when anyone with a couple of test vehicles, some LIDAR, and a vision for the future could launch a startup are at an end. And there will definitely be more shrinkage to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETwHio"&gt;“The consolidation is long overdue,” said &lt;a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~raj/"&gt;Raj Rajkumar&lt;/a&gt;, robotics professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “The AV industry has promised too much for too long, and has delivered too little.”   &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QynkTW"&gt;There are other signs of general unease in the AV world. Last month, John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364317/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-stepping-down-self-driving-cars-google-alphabet"&gt;announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Waymo&lt;/a&gt; after helping lead the company since 2015. Krafcik oversaw the transformation of Google’s self-driving car division from “Project Chauffeur” to its own standalone company. During his time, Waymo struck partnerships with several automakers, launched a limited ride-hailing pilot with fully driverless vehicles in Arizona, and expanded its commercial ambitions to include trucking and last-mile delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB9dP6"&gt;As a former auto executive with years of experience at Hyundai and Ford, Krafcik was seen as someone who could bring self-driving cars to the mainstream. But his decision to step aside at a time of heightened uncertainty highlights the difficult road ahead for self-driving cars — especially as many of those early predictions have failed to come to pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3mGhGQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Krafcik’s decision to step aside at a time of heightened uncertainty highlights the difficult road ahead&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fHGm9p"&gt;Krafcik was not able to bring to market an autonomous vehicle that can drive on any road and in any conditions without years of rigorous testing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;Aside from a small area outside Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, Waymo’s cars require backup drivers to monitor the vehicle’s operations and take control if anything goes wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjlTTe"&gt;Waymo still has a commanding lead in autonomous vehicles, but diminished expectations about the future of self-driving cars are affecting its business in other ways, too. In 2018, Morgan Stanley published a research note &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/29/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-unit-morgan-stanley-forecast-to-highs.html"&gt;valuing the company at $175 billion&lt;/a&gt; based on its perceived leadership in the space and the potential for massive amounts of revenue from its autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHRytl"&gt;A year later, the bank slashed Waymo’s valuation to $105 billion, still an extraordinary amount of money for a company with no revenue. But last year, when Waymo announced its first external funding round of $2.25 billion, the company declined to discuss what valuation that investment was based on. Later, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed8dc4ca-5eaf-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; it to be $30 billion — a nearly 85 percent decrease from 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3w20R"&gt;Valuations aren’t the sole indicator of where things stand with autonomous vehicles. But they do point to investor sentiment. And right now, investors are not feeling as confident in the prediction that autonomous vehicles will soon become the dominant form of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnwAE1Ee3kIxKoL1SoQ-oUd23l0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10793777/Van_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Drive.ai&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq6Ud7"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/faculty/missy-cummings"&gt;Missy Cummings&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University, has been criticizing rosy predictions about our driverless future. She’s consistently warned that the technology is much further away and harder to get right than anyone in the industry cares to admit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoCPjO"&gt;The recent trend in consolidation is vindication for her position, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZG8EQ1"&gt;“It’s kind of like the elephant in the room,” she said of the shrinking of the AV world. “People will mention that and then they’ll stop themselves from making the Socratic connection to what this means about the viability of this industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jl1Ncp"&gt;But Cummings doesn’t think people in the industry will be able to ignore the truth for much longer. “There is an embarrassingly large sum of money that’s been invested in this, so people feel like they have to keep going down that path because surely all these people who invested all this money can’t be wrong,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J1W5IR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not everyone is delusional. Just most people in this business.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lgF1Iy"&gt;“Not everyone is delusional,” she added. “Just most people in this business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zigYR"&gt;That said, Toyota and Aurora weren’t delusional when they decided to buy the automated driving teams at Lyft and Uber, respectively. They likely saw the value in the code produced by those teams, as well as the talent accrued by the ride-hailing companies over the years. When you can’t hire the people you’d like to staff your own projects, then you have to acquihire them, the distinctive Silicon Valley practice of buying a smaller company for the express purpose of acquiring their team of software engineers. Also, Uber and Lyft were very motivated to sell as recently public companies under pressure to staunch the bleeding and become profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQsbWp"&gt;Another recent acquihire was when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;Apple bought bankrupt self-driving startup Drive.ai &lt;/a&gt;back in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/apple-lays-off-over-200-from-project-titan-autonomous-vehicle-group.html"&gt;Apple had just laid off over 200 engineers&lt;/a&gt; from its secretive Project Titan, its own floundering self-driving operation. The Drive.ai team, composed of several graduates from Stanford’s AI lab, had already had some modest success with a ride-hailing pilot in Texas. Unhappy with its own team, Apple simply fired them and bought a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0o4gx"&gt;“The buying up of these companies represents companies being able to buy skill sets that they would not otherwise be able to recruit,” Cummings said. “And I think that’s very valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1FJYC_GL1czsvFjH11BfMhrcnHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13601830/vpavic_181128_3122_0115.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bTJCt2"&gt;The recent reorganization of the self-driving car industry may also point to a new set of priorities. Namely, robotaxis are out, and logistics and industrial applications are in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqBxk0"&gt;Four years ago, the industry saw plenty of startups come out of stealth promising to do everything: they were going to make hardware &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;software; they were going to build their own vehicle; they were going to do robotaxis &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;delivery &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;trucking. And of course, they were going to change the world in the process. “It was a little bit like the decathlete business model,” said &lt;a href="https://reillybrennan.com/"&gt;Reilly Brennan&lt;/a&gt;, general partner at venture capital firm &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.vc/"&gt;Trucks&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re going to be very good at 10 different things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHHcnn"&gt;Now, most investors are interested in more “structured” applications of automated driving technology, such as construction, mining, middle-mile delivery, and agriculture. “So instead of being a decathlete, you had to pick a javelin thrower,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wkNGZ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“So instead of being a decathlete, you had to pick a javelin thrower”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WzrNJI"&gt;That’s not to say robotaxis are completely dead — far from it, with major players like Waymo, Cruise, Argo, and Baidu as well as smaller startups like Pony.ai, May Mobility, and Optimus Ride still banking on the proliferation of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles by the middle of this decade. But Brennan says the robotaxi craze has definitely cooled in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6595S6"&gt;“Frankly, we stopped seeing robotaxi startups in probably the end of 2017,” Brennan said. “Here we are in 2021 and there are very few ongoing robotaxi startups that aren’t, you know, Cruise, Waymo, or Argo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQSpoD"&gt;Brennan thinks the concept of autonomous vehicles that can drive anywhere under any conditions is still possible, but much further out than originally thought. They will require huge financial investments — “11 figures” by Brennan’s estimates — and a willingness to tolerate zero cash flow until the technology is mature and safe enough to launch. There are only so many companies with deep enough pockets to take on that challenge: major car companies like Ford, GM, and Volkswagen or tech giants like Apple, Alphabet, and Intel. Everyone else is probably not long for this world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SszjqN"&gt;The mid-level engineers always knew this to be true, Brennan said. It was the CEOs who were making the erroneous predictions about the availability of self-driving taxis by 2020. “I think the CEOs of those companies knew that they were going to be playing golf by 2020,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic needs to tarnish Apple’s App Store halo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_dbuH7j00UhHKuAGNbEG0UMwpE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249704/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D3Yc8Y"&gt;At the beginning of this week’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple described Epic’s lawsuit as an “assault” on the entire iOS philosophy. One of the iPhone and iPad’s defining features is a curated ecosystem (or, from a different perspective, a walled garden). A loss for Apple could require it to allow side-loaded apps and alternative app stores, potentially including Epic’s own Epic Games Store. Apple says that would damage the privacy and security that iOS is known for, making Apple spend more money to fix new problems that crop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qes3P"&gt;Epic spent the fourth day of trial offering its counter-narrative: the iOS App Store isn’t actually very good. Calling two Apple executives to the stand, Epic’s attorneys took jabs at everything from the update review process to Apple allegedly leaking Marshmello’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concert playlist. They pushed Apple to justify its claims about privacy and security by producing hard research demonstrating threats and breaches — which Apple largely didn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JAdN3U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic is making the case that the app store just isn’t very good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOrmnw"&gt;After a short examination of Epic’s online business strategy head Thomas Ko, Epic called on Matt Fischer, App Store vice president and the first witness employee from Apple. Epic’s attorney peppered Fischer with anecdotes from frustrated developers — calling the iOS in-app payment system a “joke,” the refund policies “awful,” the review process “arbitrary and unpredictable,” and the entire store “plagued with outdated, low-quality apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spju9Q"&gt;Apple’s App Store has some clear problems. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;my colleague Sean Hollister wrote last month&lt;/a&gt;, you can find ridiculous stories about iOS apps that appear to swindle users yet maintain unbelievably high review stories — and aren’t removed even months after a formal complaint. Eric Friedman, an Apple employee who is set to testify, has been quoted saying the app review team is “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog” or “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qssmJ"&gt;But Epic’s questioning today didn’t capture the kind of drama that implies. The attorneys spent much of their time trying to catch Apple executives in contradictions, and while they quoted disgruntled developers like the ones above, they rarely delved into the substance of their complaints. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers became audibly irritated with Epic repeatedly producing documents to establish a “state of mind” about the App Store rather than hard facts, since the files would be uploaded for public viewing. “Non-lawyers don’t understand the difference between something being admitted for its truth and being admitted for some other evidentiary purpose,” she told an attorney. Apple countered one negative review snippet simply by having Fischer read the line above it, where the writer said they were still giving the App Store a high rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YzD79T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qj6Fko"&gt;There’s one plausible reason Epic doesn’t have more specific stories: many developers are &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/google-and-apple-scare-us-app-makers-tell-congress.html"&gt;reportedly scared to criticize Apple&lt;/a&gt;. That’s been a running theme in congressional scrutiny of Apple, and Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store — even if developers try to return via Apple’s Safari browser, they’ll be denied access to things like push notifications and AR features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiaM2i"&gt;Epic also still has witnesses who could poke holes in Apple’s narrative. Friedman is scheduled to appear over the next two weeks, and so is an executive from Match Group, which spoke critically of Apple in front of Congress. Epic’s attorneys left a big question hanging about whether Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/apple-hulu-special-api-access/"&gt;offers special terms to some developers&lt;/a&gt; — something Fischer denied, but wasn’t heavily pressed on. In any case, this trial hinges on much more than the precise quality of Apple’s developer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP4keM"&gt;But today demonstrates the difficulty of discussing large-scale moderation without opening yourself up to charges of dealing in mere anecdotes. Judge Rogers made clear that she’s interested in whether Apple is better or worse than its alternatives, not simply whether it’s ever had problems. And while Epic can point to individual screwups, Apple will try to argue that it’s doing its best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvs9pg"&gt;“It’s a human process. We do make mistakes,” said Apple’s marketing manager Trystan Kosmynka, the day’s last witness. “But we certainly try to rectify those mistakes when we learn of them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jGxtFF"&gt;Finisar, which was &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/09/finisar-acquisition-iivi-aapl-fnsr.html"&gt;later acquired by II-VI&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “two-six”) r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16771246/apple-finisar-iphone-laser-investment"&gt;eceived $390 million&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s fund back in 2017. While this latest investment likely shows that Apple intends to keep FaceID (which is powered by II-VI’s vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers) around for a while, it could also be another sign pointing to Apple’s future with AR and VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3seH3"&gt;Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;has publicly said&lt;/a&gt; that he believes AR is “critically important” to Apple’s future, and II-VI manufactures devices that help computers see the world in 3D. The money could help develop more advanced version of the technology already found on Apple devices, potentially for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;the rumored mixed reality headset&lt;/a&gt;. II-VI’s CEO says in Apple’s press release that the partnership with Apple “sets the stage for a new wave of breakthrough technologies that we believe will enable a wide range of applications that will benefit our world for decades to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuvtMT"&gt;The press release states that II-VI will use the funds to expand manufacturing capacity, create jobs, and “accelerate delivery of future components for iPhone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAHqVj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article had II-VI written as II-IV throughout. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
