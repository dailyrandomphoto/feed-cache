    <title>What’s on your desk, Dan Seifert? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A long look at the workspace of one of The Verge’s leading tech enthusiasts." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y870UlgZ0Oia76xZnZlNb5QlxkI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174303/dseifert_20210415_4535_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A long look at the workspace of one of &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s leading tech enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Visit the office of a Verge gearhead&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="sNynCU"&gt;If you’ve read a review, a gift guide, or a how-to on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, then you’ve read something that’s been assigned by, edited by, or written by Dan Seifert. A longtime presence here, Dan’s knowledge of tech is vast and impressive — and is reflected by the number and quality of the devices you can see here in his home office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqVuZd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTQcpJ"&gt;I’ve been at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for nearly nine years and have held many hats and done many jobs over that time. But I’ve always had an involvement in the product reviews program, because I’m a complete gearhead who loves playing with new gadgets and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOyWjy"&gt;Currently, I’m a deputy editor who helps run &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; machine every day. I oversee our entire product reviews and service journalism program, including reviews, gift guides, buying guides, how-to articles, deals articles, and yes, the “What’s on your desk?” series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt7mtp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ytapus"&gt;I’ve been working from home a few days per week for a long time, so when we bought our current house a few years ago, one of the requirements was that it would have a dedicated office space that I could work from. That’s proven immensely helpful over the past year as we transitioned to a fully remote working environment during the pandemic. I cannot put enough emphasis on how valuable a separate workspace, complete with a door you can close, is when you work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF4Lwy"&gt;That hasn’t stopped me from spending far too much time in here, though, as I also use this space for personal hobbies like tinkering with keyboards or playing the occasional PC game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dan’s desk is large enough to have space for multiple devices at the same time." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SmztO5AbQ4OLsqSQ2o6nBI5KrdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461580/dseifert_20210415_4535_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan’s desk is large enough to have space for multiple devices at the same time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zPhTSh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50C7bG"&gt;The desk is one that is probably familiar to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers, as it’s shown up in a few “What’s on your desk?” articles already. It’s a &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fview%2Fid%2F233%2Fs%2Fjarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo%2Fcategory%2F3%2F%3Futm_source%3DNYMag%26utm_medium%3Drakuten%26ranMID%3D44880%26ranEAID%3DOHlcvPYhHQM%26ranSiteID%3DOHlcvPYhHQM-I22_PHu1Y9zpq1rraujdUw&amp;amp;xcust=VergeWOYDDanSeifert04212021"&gt;Fully Jarvis adjustable standing desk&lt;/a&gt; that I purchased about five years ago, back before the company rebranded from Ergo Depot to Fully. Believe it or not, I actually use the standing feature quite a bit and switch between standing and sitting modes multiple times per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOOD7c"&gt;Mine is big — one of the things I wanted from it was the space to have multiple devices on the desk at the same time, since I’m constantly having to test new things. It’s 60 inches wide, has a bamboo top, and has the “ergo cut” in the front that makes it a little easier to pull my chair up close to it. Mounted underneath and out of site is a swiveling pencil tray that I keep odds and ends in, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Delivery-Anker-PowerStrip-Outlets-Control/dp/B07DFFX34P?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ad7cde89cb7f54d6cfe0c7619be64272&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Anker power adapter&lt;/a&gt; that has two three-prong power outlets, two USB-A ports, a USB-C port for easy device charging, and cable trays for all of the power strips that I need to run everything on my desk. Those plug in to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CyberPower-CP1500AVRLCD-Intelligent-Outlets-Mini-Tower/dp/B000FBK3QK?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=77ab0d3b5730457eb060aeb644d94dcf&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;CyberPower UPS&lt;/a&gt; down on the floor, which I bought when we started having some issues with power flickering in our house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IEiK01"&gt;
&lt;div id="MP84Ae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10458129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0ZG3eN"&gt;
&lt;p id="3oeQ17"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And how about your desk chair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7UQzF"&gt;My chair is a relatively recent addition — the one I had for years worked fine for a couple of days per week working from home, but when I transferred to full-time remote, it just wasn’t cutting it. So I jumped last year when Amazon had a sale on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steelcase-442A40-5S25-Gesture-Graphite/dp/B016OIF2JU?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9d31b2bf1192b3922f7ffdd8d3d731ef&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Steelcase Gesture&lt;/a&gt;, which was admittedly way more expensive than a chair should be (even on sale!), but it’s comfortable and endlessly adjustable, so I’ve been happy with it so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkQM8M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a LOT of tech — more than we usually get to talk about. Why don’t we start with your main working setup? (That’s quite a monitor, by the way — and an interesting keyboard.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruPwvO"&gt;I did warn you — I love gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RACHbc"&gt;The monitor is a 34-inch LG 34UM94-P ultrawide that I’ve had for about five years now. It’s great — I’ve plugged countless laptops, desktops, and other devices into it and it just gives me so much room for digital activities. It’s not the best for gaming, since it only goes up to 60Hz refresh rates, but its 3440 x 1440 resolution is ideal for productivity and photo editing. It’s mounted on an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Premium-Single-Monitor-Stand/dp/B00MIBN16O?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=fbe892d1a6c334c8fadd6fe81d23d056&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Amazon Basics monitor arm&lt;/a&gt;, which keeps it at eye level for me and frees up more space on my desk. That weird little white puck in the middle of the stand post is a SmartThings motion and temperature sensor, which controls the smart lights and fans in my office. It’s in that spot because that’s where it can reliably see my fingers moving on the keyboard or mouse, which prevents the lights from shutting off in the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0qW4n"&gt;The keyboard is something I’ve spent a ton of time (and way too much money) tinkering on, and I’m constantly changing parts of it to try different things. The board itself is an &lt;a href="https://epomaker.com/collections/mini-64/products/epomaker-gk68xs?variant=31743346737225"&gt;Epomaker / Skyloong GK68XS aluminum&lt;/a&gt;, which has a compact 65 percent layout, hot swappable switches, and built-in Bluetooth support. I bought it completely assembled, but before I even plugged it in, I pulled all the keycaps and switches out of it and replaced them with ones of my own choosing. The caps are currently the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2F%3Forigin%3D%252Fbuy%252Fdrop-matt3o-mt3-susuwatari-custom-keycap-set&amp;amp;xcust=VergeWOYDDanSeifert04222021"&gt;Matt3o MT3 Susuwatari set from Drop&lt;/a&gt; and the switches are &lt;a href="https://mkultra.click/gazzew-boba-silent-tactile-u4-switches"&gt;Gazzew Boba U4 silent tactiles&lt;/a&gt;, which I have dismantled and put 55g springs inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UF5Xnm"&gt;
&lt;div id="BrtNY3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10458140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Xpp4Bs"&gt;
&lt;p id="7l56kz"&gt;I recently rewatched &lt;em&gt;Halt and Catch Fire&lt;/em&gt; and was enamored with the vintage PC keyboards they used in the show, so I built this one with that aesthetic in mind. As mentioned, it’s a wireless board, but I couldn’t resist getting one of those &lt;a href="https://mechcables.com/collections/pre-made/products/stealth-gray-coiled-aviator-cable"&gt;fancy coiled cables&lt;/a&gt; for it, so I typically use it plugged in most of the time. I don’t like noisy keyboards at all, but this setup is surprisingly quiet — even quieter than the keyboard on my MacBook Air. I have no issue using it during Zoom calls and will probably bring it to the office with me when we return to work there since it won’t disturb others. That will free up space on my desk for another keyboard, giving me a whole new thing to tinker with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A SmartThings motion / temperature sensor hangs next to a CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt 3 dock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A set of Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 next to a long-discontinued speaker from Audyssey." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbV9GkSC-82jMFNvIvPyRqr9RsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461576/dseifert_20210415_4535_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A set of Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 next to a long-discontinued speaker from Audyssey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vnWAtn"&gt;Next to it is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Vertical-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B07FNJB8TT?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=98868343bc48c0c2d331becc3cea68a5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Logitech MX Vertical mouse&lt;/a&gt;, which I got when I started having some pain in my right shoulder after using a mouse all day. It seems to have relieved it, but if you can avoid getting old, I recommend that instead — it’s no fun. The other piece of ergonomic equipment I have is the wrist rest in front of the keyboard, which I can’t type without. I’ve tried soft wrist rests before, but I really like the support this &lt;a href="https://www.nizkeyboard.com/collections/ornaments/products/walnut-wood-keyboard-handle-60-81-84-87-108-size-customization?variant=31000131829831"&gt;walnut one from NIZ Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; provides. It also looks nice, which I can’t always say for soft types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lJ1H1"&gt;Every device on my desk — monitor, keyboard, speakers, microphone, external storage drives, laptop, camera, Ethernet — is plugged into a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CalDigit-TS3-Plus-Thunderbolt-Dock/dp/B07CZPV8DF?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=44e010434d44d85df190150cf59f5f6f&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;CalDigit TS3 Plus&lt;/a&gt; Thunderbolt 3 dock. I love this thing because it lets me easily swap between computers with just one cable, keeps my laptop charged up, and gives me all the ports I need. It even has a high-speed SD card slot on the front which I use all the time when dumping images from my camera. My only gripe is the obvious cable management mess you can see behind it — I’ve given up trying to make it any better than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="X67m9v"&gt;
&lt;div id="1NVm1L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10199988"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="6vcgEs"&gt;
&lt;p id="B0JrpB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a more complete assortment of devices for online meetings than most, with a camera, microphone, headphones…  And I see you use a “regular” camera for your video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmtCxf"&gt;Yeah, it’s… a lot. The headphones are a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEW-Microsoft-Surface-Headphones-Light/dp/B086Q9YGD3?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d3a04f9c332ba2e81dc27685ed0aa4d2&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Microsoft Surface Headphones 2&lt;/a&gt; that I put on an old Twelve South Fermata stand, which has a built-in cable to charge them up when I’m done. I use these wirelessly the vast majority of the time and for every video call meeting I take, so even though they have relatively good battery life, I still have to charge them every other day or so. A lot of times, I just have them on with nothing playing because the noise cancellation blocks out the sounds of my kids playing just outside the office door. I’ve also got a set of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=12835663ef7b1640a2b324d53871b825&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mophie-Wireless-Charge-Pad-Charging/dp/B07XPWD4WW?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ed53412036c3100213a44762a5f822b5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Mophie 3-in-1 wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; that I use if I forget to charge the Surface Headphones or just need a break from something sitting on my head. Also on my desk and plugged into the Thunderbolt dock is a set of &lt;a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;amp;_trksid=p2546172.m570.l1313&amp;amp;_nkw=lower+east+side+speakers&amp;amp;_sacat=0&amp;amp;mkcid=1&amp;amp;mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&amp;amp;siteid=0&amp;amp;campid=5338794975&amp;amp;customid=VergeWOYDanSeifert04222021&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;mkevt=1#donotlink"&gt;long-discontinued Audyssey Lower East Side speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have enough punch on their own that I don’t need a subwoofer for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8jzsD"&gt;When I need to record better audio for a podcast, I use the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=7d3b63ea07e45c2f39167a4364e3ce95&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Blue Yeti mic&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DHLSTLV?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=af2adee52e919fd7d8f7cac2cb215183&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;swiveling boom arm&lt;/a&gt; that I can just push out of the way when I don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ARkpx"&gt;The camera is a Fujifilm X-H1 mounted on an adjustable rig I &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1015864-REG%2Fimpact_3_section_double_articulated.html&amp;amp;xcust=VergeWOYDDanSeifert04212021"&gt;cobbled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/824360-REG/impact_cc_106r_super_clamp_with_ratchet.html"&gt;together&lt;/a&gt; and is plugged into an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y7BFXVM?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5e10fc3b8f0697b5ee4b6b4014cdbdcd&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;HDMI capture card&lt;/a&gt; that’s mounted out of sight behind the monitor. Its video quality is a lot better than any webcam you can purchase, even if it’s decidedly overkill for the Zoom calls that I do all day long. Hooking it all up is surprisingly easy to do if you have a camera lying around — I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21244380/webcam-camera-how-to-dslr-mirrorless-capture-card-usb-hdmi"&gt;wrote about how to do it for the site&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXR5e6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next to the window, you have a tablet and — what looks like a small pile of tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UjaLd"&gt;Ah yes, the overflow pile. Over there is where I have a pencil cup, some notebooks, and random headphones. There’s also an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-8/dp/B07PF1Y28C?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=886f2bf0e5b8c636c150ddc51968b7f6&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt; that alerts me when someone has rung the doorbell and also lets me tap into the baby camera so I can keep an eye on her when she’s napping. There are a couple other smart home sensors there, too, which help my HVAC system know when I’m in the office and adjust itself accordingly. Mounted on the wall is a bulletin board where I’ve got some pictures of my kids and artwork they’ve made for me. And, oh yeah, there’s a lightsaber.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The overflow pile includes review devices, sensors, and an Echo Show 8." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9lLVA8NbCTJSVKnshft3fk0122U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461579/dseifert_20210415_4535_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The overflow pile includes review devices, sensors, and an Echo Show 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3O7mO4"&gt;My daily work computer is an &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1041045/7613?sharedid=VergeWOYDDanSeifert04222021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, which works great for nearly everything. But if I want to play games, I need a Windows machine, so over on the other side of the desk is my gaming laptop (an &lt;a href="https://www.eluktronics.com/MAG-15-1P16R"&gt;Eluktronics MAG-15&lt;/a&gt; with an RTX 2070), plus a 12.9-inch 2018 iPad Pro that I used to use a lot more when I commuted. It has built-in LTE, which is a lifesaver on the train but not especially useful when I’m home on Wi-Fi all the time. This pile is also where the rotating cast of review devices tend to live when I’m testing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hJ4lKP"&gt;
&lt;div id="O0ar7I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="x58Rfn"&gt;
&lt;p id="6rbGVI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All in all, you seem pretty organized — you even have a box for your really small items.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSILu5"&gt;If there’s one complaint I have with my desk, it’s that there’s no under-desk storage, so I basically have to keep everything on top of it or in other organizing systems elsewhere in my office. So in addition to the hidden pencil tray mounted underneath the desk, I have some &lt;a href="https://www.muji.us/store/furniture-interior/storage-organizers.html"&gt;small stackable Muji makeup trays&lt;/a&gt; to keep random things like SIM card tools, batteries, microfiber cloths, SD cards, USB cables, etc. somewhat organized. There’s often a lot of spill over, though, and since this desk is so big, it’s easy for me to ignore the mess and let it pile up. It’s possible I may have cheated a little and cleaned up before taking these pictures, but I won’t tell if you don’t. &lt;em&gt;[Editor’s note: it’s too late — we’ve all seen your desk at the office...]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fcH8A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And with all that tech, you still have an old-fashioned notebook and pen by your keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqm5Ur"&gt;I’ve spent so many years trying to make a digital note-taking system work for me, but I just can’t get along with writing on a screen. I keep a Moleskine notebook open next to me at all times so I can quickly jot down things I need to remember or notes when I’m in a call or meeting. I find I can pay attention to meetings better when I’m handwriting notes compared to typing them out, even if I struggle to actually read my handwriting afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8GgIZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else about your workspace that we haven’t covered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JTQIQH"&gt;Being forced to tally all of this stuff up makes me realize just how much is involved with my work setup. It could probably use a bit of pruning and simplification. But since I spend so much time here, investing in the space has been worth it, even if it seems like a lot when it’s all added up. Between the comfort and efficiency my workspace gives me, I don’t totally dread spending most of my day in this spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0u0R6Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BXYT5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft releases Office 2021 for Mac preview</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HU0XifkQndRgA4G7dtf1vQyddk0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174157/officeicons.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B3VY3V"&gt;Microsoft is releasing a preview version of Office 2021 for Mac and Office LTSC this week. While Office LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) is &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/commercial-preview-of-microsoft-office-long-term-servicing/ba-p/2260013"&gt;designed for commercial customers&lt;/a&gt;, both versions are perpetual versions of Office that don’t rely on subscriptions or the cloud. Microsoft announced its plans for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288959/microsoft-office-2021-windows-mac-features-release-date-price"&gt;Office 2021 back in February&lt;/a&gt;, and a Windows version — which won’t be available in preview — will also be released later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFjn18"&gt;Office 2021 for Mac will support both Apple Silicon and Intel-based Macs, and require at least 4GB of RAM and 10GB of storage space. It’s designed to be a static release of Office, but during the preview there will be monthly updates that could include new features. Once Office 2021 for Mac is final and released, no new features will be added. Current &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/office2021/overview-mac-preview"&gt;improvements include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kykYrT"&gt;Line Focus, this feature removes distractions to let Word users move through a document line by line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iNW3AM"&gt;XLOOKUP, an Excel feature that lets you find things in a table or range by row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Pddsg"&gt;Dynamic array support in Excel, which has new functions for dynamic arrays in spreadsheets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nFdtpj"&gt;Record a slide show with narration in PowerPoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MV6Iiw"&gt;Microsoft’s Office LTSC variant will also include things like dark mode support, accessibility improvements, and the same Dynamic Arrays and XLOOKUP features found in Excel 2021 for Mac. Office 2021 for Windows will include similar features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqNCk3"&gt;If you’re interested in trying out Office 2021 for Mac, you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2Ffwlink%2Fp%2F%3Flinkid%3D2159127&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399042%2Fmicrosoft-office-2021-for-mac-preview-download" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;download the installer from Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt; and a special &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2Ffwlink%2Fp%2F%3Flinkid%3D2147058&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399042%2Fmicrosoft-office-2021-for-mac-preview-download" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Volume License Serializer&lt;/a&gt; to activate the preview.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple lawsuit over ‘buy’ and ‘rent’ labels for digital content can continue, rules federal judge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fq0LmCW3roSsZeMH42Rdq4LXNcA=/42x0:1590x1032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174133/apple_previews_macos_catalina_apple_music_screen_06032019.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZAqtTC"&gt;A federal judge has rejected a motion by Apple to dismiss a putative class action lawsuit over the company’s use of the labels “buy” and “rent” when selling digital content. As first covered by &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/apple-must-face-lawsuit-for-telling-consumers-they-can-buy-movies-tv-shows"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the suit can now continue, though could yet be settled before ever reaching trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnmeP6"&gt;The lead plaintiff in the case, David Andino, argues that Apple is misleading consumers when it tells them it can “buy” digital versions of albums, TV shows, and films from its stores. Why? Because the iPhone-maker retains the power to terminate customers’ access to this content whenever it likes. This can happen, for example, when the company loses distribution rights to content that users haven’t secured by downloading to their device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HAO8ke"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just like Best Buy cannot come into a person’s home to repossess [your] DVD”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M0ptNB"&gt;“Just like Best Buy cannot come into a person’s home to repossess the movie DVD that such person purchased from it, defendant should not be able to remove, or permit the removal by others of, digital content from its customers,” says Andino’s &lt;a href="http://casefilingsalert.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Apple-Video-Content.pdf"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. “Though some consumers may get lucky and never lose access to any of their paid for media, others may one day find that their digital content is now gone forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7Oc68"&gt;Apple attempted to have the case dismissed, but a ruling this week by US District Court Judge John Mendez shows that the company’s arguments weren’t entirely convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WA5YOC"&gt;“Apple contends that ‘[n]o reasonable consumer would believe’ that purchased content would remain on the iTunes platform indefinitely,” wrote Mendez in an &lt;a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/california/caedce/2:2020cv01628/377618/22/0.pdf?ts=1618990542"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; filed with the Eastern District of California. “But in common usage, the term ‘buy’ means to acquire possession over something. It seems plausible, at least at the motion to dismiss stage, that reasonable consumers would expect their access couldn’t be revoked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="XIvBgO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To quote Webster’s definition of “buy”...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O69b21"&gt;To emphasize his point, Mendez pointed to the definition of the word “buy” in the &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buy"&gt;Mirriam-Webster dictionary&lt;/a&gt; (meaning “to acquire possession, ownership, or rights to the use or services of by payment especially of money”) — a timeless move that is, apparently, as welcome in federal legal proceedings as in hastily-written wedding speeches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27Kz4t"&gt;Apple tried to argue that Andino’s “injury” was purely speculative, as he has not actually lost access to any content. But, as Mendez summarizes, the injury being presented is not the threat of losing future access, but the deception involved in Apple’s use of the word “buy.” This misleads consumers about the exact nature of ownership, meaning Andino “paid either too much for the product or spent money he would not have but for the misrepresentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwygkI"&gt;Apple did have some success, though, and one element of the lawsuit was dismissed: Andino’s claims to “unjust enrichment,” which would affect how any potential damages would be calculated. Mendez did, though, leave open the possibility of future “injunctive relief” — that is, material changes to how Apple sells content in future. All these questions, though, will have to be settled in future proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Siri Remote waves goodbye to Apple TV games that require motion control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVlOdKQnByZasU0uBk2tT9_NSXs=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69173835/WcGeQVXeT3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SFX6wg"&gt;Apple’s new Siri Remote doesn’t come equipped with an accelerometer or gyroscope, which means it won’t work as a motion controller in certain Apple TV games. The omission was initially &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/new-siri-remote-59-dollars/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and can be seen on the remotes’ product pages. The &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ir5H-fryxNwJ:https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MQGD2ZM/A/siri-remote+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; Siri Remote lists an “Accelerometer” and “Three-axis gyro” in the tech specs, but they’re missing from the &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:n66JH8vbfHYJ:https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJFM3LL/A/siri-remote+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;new listing&lt;/a&gt; (we’ve linked to a Google Cache because as of this writing Apple’s store is down ahead of AirTags pre-orders going live).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7asiI"&gt;The change means that the new Siri Remote won’t work with certain Apple TV games that rely on motion controls. According to code in tvOS 14.5 &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/22/new-siri-remote-lacks-accelerometer-gyroscope/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, trying to play an incompatible game will lead to the following error message: “To play this game on your Apple TV, you need to connect the Apple TV Remote (1st generation) or a compatible PlayStation, Xbox or MFi controller.” If you’ve got one, you might want to keep an old Siri Remote around for occasions like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQhZTH"&gt;The lack of motion controls might sound surprising given the new Apple TV box was expected to have a bigger gaming focus, and arrives as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple Arcade is maturing&lt;/a&gt; into a pretty compelling games subscription service. But in recent years Apple has shifted its attention towards more traditional gaming controllers, away from motion controls. It dropped its requirement for games to support the Siri Remote’s motion controls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/14/11930760/apple-tv-games-controller-remote-requirement"&gt;in June 2016&lt;/a&gt; just months after the remote launched alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9630952/new-apple-tv-4-review"&gt;2015 Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in June 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650683/apple-tv-xbox-one-ps4-controller-support-wwdc-2019"&gt;it announced&lt;/a&gt; Apple TV support for Xbox One and PS4 controllers. Support for PS5 and Xbox Series X and S controllers is &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1612241720"&gt;expected to arrive with tvOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTdow6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJqfkY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends reprieve, won’t take a cut of online classes and events until next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9YV-Fg0lbSGN7QOfXK9oShZhfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69173462/acastro_190322_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vl0knn"&gt;Apple announced on Wednesday that it’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6qfoid1d&amp;amp;1619114022"&gt;once again extending the deadline&lt;/a&gt; for requiring in-app purchases for iOS apps that sell access to online classes and group events until December 31st, 2021, effectively meaning it won’t impose its 30 percent cut on businesses providing those services until next year. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21595040/apple-developer-in-app-purchase-deadline-online-classes-events"&gt;extended the deadline initially to June 30th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but now developers have another six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TeBrI"&gt;Apple cites the ongoing pandemic as its main justification for the change, but we have to wonder if it might also have something to do with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;the Congressional antitrust hearings that have zeroed in on whether Apple and Google’s app stores are monopolies&lt;/a&gt;. Helping out small businesses by not taking its traditional 30 percent cut is an example Apple can now use to demonstrate how it encourages small businesses to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGWxmt"&gt;Wednesday’s &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/antitrust-applied-examining-competition-in-app-stores"&gt;“Antitrust Applied: Examining Competition in App Stores”&lt;/a&gt; hearing featured complaints from lost item tracker company Tile, who Apple is now in direct competition with thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s new AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and Match Group, whose Tinder dating app uses Apple’s in-app purchases for subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oDlVz"&gt;Not every company pays 30 percent. Apple doesn’t apply the same in-app purchases requirement to one-on-one classes like tutoring, so individuals can take other forms of payments and bypass Apple’s cut entirely. Apple’s also been criticized for quietly creating special deals for big companies like Amazon, where subscriptions sold on its Prime Video app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;are only subject to a 15 percent fee&lt;/a&gt;. (Generally, Apple doesn’t reduce its cut of subscription fees to 15 percent until users have been subscribed for a full year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGfuN5"&gt;After Amazon’s seeming sweetheart deal came to light, Apple launched a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021 where developers who earn less than $1 million in sales every year can apply to lower Apple’s commission to 15 percent on purchases — but only with Apple’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVIcV8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;Apple is now launching podcast subscriptions too&lt;/a&gt;, ones where podcasters can join by paying $19.99 a year plus 30 percent of each subscriber’s first year of revenue, then 15 percent after for subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="enJjh1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Can Apple get you to pay for podcasts?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price"},{"title":"Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching the most egregious scams","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Can Apple get you to pay for podcasts?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yI6dGrsZAUdMc5nzX-oEDn2h16o=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170854/VRG_ILLO_4546_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The world’s most popular podcast app gets subscriptions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CyXaHi"&gt;Beth Silvers credits paid subscriptions for making podcasting her full-time job. She and Sarah Stewart Holland host &lt;a href="https://www.pantsuitpoliticsshow.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show that tries to turn political punditry into “grace-filled conversations.” The two of them launched the show in 2015 and then started experimenting with subscriptions two years later, first on their own website in the form of monthly contributions, and then, not long after, on Patreon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpYz2O"&gt;Three years later, they now have over 4,000 monthly subscribers who pay anywhere from $5 to $100 per month, employ a full-time listener-turned-employee, and fully focus their time on the show. Their revenue is now equally made up of advertising and memberships. “It was still a big risk [when we switched to Patreon],” Silvers says. “We weren’t quite at a sustainable point. We thought to get to sustainability, we’ve got to invest more time here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JWBcU"&gt;Now, the women are trying something new: Apple Podcasts subscriptions. They’re among the first creators who’ve signed up to try the service, which allows podcasters to offer paid subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;from within the Podcasts app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNCclH"&gt;The most popular podcasting app putting its weight behind subscriptions could be monumental. Apple has the chance to popularize paid subscriptions by making it easy to listen and subscribe in one place, and it could influence the industry to shift slightly away from its dependence on advertising at the same time. Plus, unlike other solutions, Apple will also allow listeners to try these subscriptions for free for a limited amount of time, giving people a chance to preview what they’re paying to access. Apple’s not precious about the content podcasters offer there, either. Shows and bonus content don’t have to be exclusive to the platform, and they can mix free and paid content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRuoiNM2PxuTr4bDIIlEr1U9X7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462736/download.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Podcasts’ subscription product will let creators decide how much to charge for content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iEEODu"&gt;“When Apple does [subscriptions], it’s like flicking a switch,” says Jacob Weisberg, CEO of podcasting network Pushkin Industries, which author Malcolm Gladwell co-founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47ZJC9"&gt;Even David Stern, the CEO of Supporting Cast, which runs a competing podcast subscription platform, sees Apple’s entrance as a turning point for the industry. “The number one challenge we have in getting podcasters to consider working with Supporting Cast is simply that people aren’t used to the idea of a paid podcast,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.supportingcast.fm/post/what-apple-podcast-subscriptions-means-for-supporting-cast-slate-and-our-podcasters-2"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. “Apple’s push into premium content will help the industry understand how much revenue they are leaving on the table by not giving their listeners something to pay for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0kGta"&gt;The potential upside for podcasters is huge. Apple Podcasts is the biggest podcast listening platform in the world, and listeners won’t have to leave the app to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6d4Qq"&gt;But the service does come with trade-offs. Most crucially, podcasters have to pay a flat fee of $19.99 per year to even offer subscriptions, and they then give Apple a 30 percent cut of revenue for each subscriber’s first year and 15 percent for the years following. Patreon, in contrast, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing"&gt;takes up to&lt;/a&gt; 12 percent of creators’ revenue. Apple Podcasts is also only available on iOS devices, which most of the world doesn’t use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tArcOr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple could make paying for podcasts mainstream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5rI0H"&gt;Those may be tough terms for podcasters, but it might pay off. Apple Podcasts’ marketing potential is massive, and it should make it far easier for hosts to promote a subscription. Right now, podcasters who offer exclusive or bonus content often do so through private RSS feeds, which require listeners to input a link into the listening app of their choice — a feature that some apps, like Spotify, don’t support. Podcasters might have to walk them through this process, and if someone cancels their membership, it generally falls on the podcaster to make sure their RSS link access is revoked. Getting listeners to pay also usually involves convincing them to sign up for another platform, like Patreon, a far bigger hurdle than tapping a button inside the app they’re already using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cu2p8h"&gt;This is why the &lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt; team signed up for Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions, especially considering a majority of their listeners are on Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcQd85"&gt;“We like giving our listeners options, and we feel like there are people who probably would like our bonus content who just don’t want to deal with the hassle of figuring Patreon out,” Silvers says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNr0N0"&gt;But they’re going to have to get creative with how they advertise their perks. Patreon is more fully built out to support creators who want various benefits. In &lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt;’ case, subscribers not only receive bonus content, but also a community on Patreon itself where they can chat about episodes and participate in a book club where Silvers and Stewart Holland ship the books they plan to discuss. Silvers and Stewart Holland also receive their listeners’ personal information, like addresses, which help them decide where to tour. Their listeners’ emails, which they also receive, allow them to send FYIs about ticket sales or other content, like YouTube Lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nJQ1hW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hurdle of signing up for an extra service might be too much for some listeners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3uuGmR"&gt;“We all just love convenience, like we love our stuff to just be in one place,” says Jessica Cordova Kramer, the CEO of Lemonada Media, which plans to use Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions in addition to existing subscription services. “And yes, there’s an extra hoop to jump through if you’re using something that’s outside the listening ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH5GaL"&gt;Apple doesn’t yet seem interested in building the social aspect of podcasting communities, so if podcasters want to advertise their Discord or Patreon, they’ll have to shout out those perks and ask listeners to contact them for access — another hurdle. Apple also won’t give podcasters their listeners’ emails, names, phone numbers, addresses, or any personal information, so Apple ends up mediating all interactions and keeping the data. Apple does say it’ll give podcasters aggregated, anonymized analytics about their listeners, like where they’re based, but these tools likely won’t wholly replace the benefits of having subscribers’ emails or names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elvcpq"&gt;“Having the Discord in our community has been so rewarding to us, the hosts, and the people that have joined it. Without being able to foster that ... is almost like a blocker for the Apple subscriptions,” says Matt Kolowski, a host of a show about movies called &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/70mm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;70mm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has around 140 subscribers on Patreon. “I’d really love for them to realize that a sense of community is such a huge part of creating a fun podcast experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubPsqH"&gt;In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about Apple’s push into subscriptions, Patreon’s chief revenue officer Kerri Pollard specifically called out its community features as a selling point. “We know creators see the value in our offering that serves them and their communities first, and will continue to use Patreon,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDf8jm"&gt;Community has become so important, in fact, that even Facebook justified &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;its push&lt;/a&gt; into audio and podcasting this week because of it. The company says 170 million people on Facebook are connected to a page that’s linked to a specific podcast, and more than 35 million people are members of fan groups around podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="41LJxw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some podcasters say, more than anything else, their subscribers value community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nFoA8h"&gt;Another factor for podcasters to consider: more platforms means more administrative work. RSS promised one feed for all the apps, but the ecosystem of subscriptions isn’t shaping up that way. Kolowski and his co-hosts upload bonus and early access content to Patreon; their usual shows to their hosting provider, Anchor; and if they participate in Apple Podcasts, they’d need to separately post uploads there, too. If Spotify gets into the subscription game, they might have to manually upload content there as well — although being on Anchor, a Spotify company, might pay off in that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYsMQg"&gt;“Ultimately, I don’t really want like four places to upload a podcast to because selfishly, I don’t want to have that kind of legwork,” Kolowski says, adding that most of his show’s listeners are on Pocket Casts, not Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Xli1"&gt;But for larger networks, Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions might be the right fit at the right time. Pushkin Industries &lt;a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/news/announcing-pushnik-premium-subscription-program/"&gt;is launching&lt;/a&gt; its first subscription program, PushNik, through Apple Podcasts, with plans to eventually make the bonus and exclusive content available on other apps. Pushkin CEO Weisberg helped &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launch Slate Plus, a subscription program that includes ad-free podcasts, years ago, and says, at the time, there were no easy solutions for publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCgfDG"&gt;“It was so clunky to get the private RSS feed into whatever player you use,” he says. “It’s just a lot of steps, and to me it was really difficult, and the thing that I was always banging on about at Slate was we’ve got to reduce the number of clicks to get the bonus content for subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUlcSH"&gt;Apple’s subscriptions solve that. Of course, in the years since &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launched Slate Plus, Patreon has sprung up, as have other companies like Supporting Cast, which &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launched to help other podcasters set up memberships. They don’t solve the one-click problem, but they at least provide the infrastructure and tech support to keep a subscription business running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GkvBfu"&gt;For these networks, a 30 percent initial cut that eventually goes to 15 percent might be worth it. Extra money is extra money. But for the smaller podcasters who’ve focused on community and creating a fan base of engaged listeners, Apple might not provide enough — especially if a show reaches a global audience that’s more Android-based than iOS. But it seems almost certain that with Apple supporting and caring about subscriptions, more people than ever before will be paying for shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Put macOS on the iPad, you cowards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad Pro 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07sFWBZAfun631ZXLpVBIFBiyC0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168801/ipadpro2021lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aawcti"&gt;Okay, hear me out on this. I really would just like Apple’s next iPad Pro to be a laptop. Not a clamshell, but a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt; type of deal: a tablet with laptop hardware and a laptop OS. I think there must be people at Apple who want this, too, so I’m now respectfully requesting that the company stop dilly-dallying and make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MybJ4v"&gt;Here’s my reasoning: at Tuesday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;Spring Loaded event&lt;/a&gt;, Apple finally unveiled a long-rumored update to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. While the device doesn’t look too different from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394384/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-comparison"&gt;iPad Pro models&lt;/a&gt; of years past, it’s a huge leap forward on the inside because it’s powered by Apple’s eight-core M1 processor. That’s the same processor that powers its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; (as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt;), and it’s exceptional. To repeat, the new iPad Pro isn’t using a Macbook-&lt;em&gt;adjacent &lt;/em&gt;or MacBook-&lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; processor. It’s using the same processor that’s in those laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHNb2N"&gt;Let’s review what else the iPad Pro can do. It now supports &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22396449%2Fapple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Thunderbolt 3&lt;/a&gt; and can power additional displays at up to 6K resolution. It supports 5G. It can come with up to 2TB of storage and 16GB of RAM. You can connect a keyboard and touchpad. On paper, that’s a laptop. (Or it’s a Surface Pro, whatever you want to call that.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bz82VRGHsKgD0S2272wfd2glUlg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460638/lcimg_80056320_9cae_41a0_ae7b_242b83419310.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GrOfJI"&gt;But that’s before you actually use the thing. Personally, I just can’t use iPadOS for my daily multitasking workload. On a MacBook, I can duck in and out of Zoom calls to mess around in Chrome and keep several tabs and applications open on my screen at once. Doing that on the iPad is, comparatively, a mess — I can reasonably look at one or two apps max, resizing is a pain, and it doesn’t take full advantage of my external display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13sRfW"&gt;Furthermore, iOS apps still have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;less functionality&lt;/a&gt; than their macOS counterparts across the board. A MacBook can just do more. And until the iPad Pro gains the ability to run macOS apps (or, dare I suggest, macOS), I don’t see that calculus changing. I’m far from a creative professional, but I still need my daily driver to be able to run the full version of Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsakfa"&gt;But now that the iPad Pro is an M1 system, I don’t see why it &lt;em&gt;can’t &lt;/em&gt;run macOS apps. Because it has the same hardware as the MacBook Air (including the fanless form factor). So the iPad really should be able to run whatever the MacBook Air can run. (And the MacBook Air can run just about whatever you want. Take a look at our review for a deep dive there.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JE2pd4"&gt;Battery is a potential pitfall: the larger iPad has a nearly 20 percent smaller battery than the Air (40.88Whr to the Air’s 49.9Whr). But both M1 MacBooks have excellent battery life, and the larger iPad’s battery is still similar in size to that of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;Lenovo’s ThinkPad X12 Detachable&lt;/a&gt; and bigger than that of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20948092/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; — neither of which have been a disaster in our testing. So I’d be surprised if it can’t get the job done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbJS4P"&gt;Apple has also shown that it’s not afraid to bring consumers into a messy software transition. After all, the new M1 MacBooks can run iPhone and iPad apps natively. Many of them, upon the machines’ release, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;weren’t available&lt;/a&gt; or didn’t work well. The sky did not fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24mltE"&gt;And of course, Apple has been working to make its ecosystem more cohesive for quite a while. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902020/macos-catalina-review-apple-music-podcasts-catalyst-ipad-apps"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; makes it more convenient for developers to port their apps between iPadOS and macOS. And many of the tweaks the company made to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur &lt;/a&gt;seem specifically designed to bring the operating system closer to the look and feel of iOS — from the rounded window corners and iOS-ified dock icons to the newly translucent layers — and some of its new features (like the new Control Center and the native iOS apps) are iPad staples that don’t make a ton of sense to have on a non-touch device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHLy3v"&gt;The result of all this is that we’re moving toward a weird point in the evolution of these two devices where the MacBook can do everything the iPad can do (but it doesn’t have the touchscreen hardware to take advantage of all of it), while the iPad can still only do iPad things (even though features of macOS would take good advantage of its touchscreen capability). It seems like a point where Apple’s goals of “creating a seamless ecosystem” and “selling you many different products” are starting to butt heads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHZuTZ"&gt;So putting macOS apps on the iPad seems like a natural next step in Apple’s process. And from a consumer perspective, I think it could only be a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Io6uKfyBXhbwHw3tr3eFhFsafeI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459118/Center_stage_ipad.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what video calls on the iPad are supposed to look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6Tjr86"&gt;In addition to the touch capability and stylus support, the new iPad Pro makes up for the MacBook’s greatest weakness: its grainy garbage webcam. The iPad Pro has been upgraded with a new 12MP TrueDepth ultrawide camera and a feature called Center Stage, which will follow you around and keep your face centered during video chats. This is a great feature for students and professionals who have to take a lot of conference calls from home (myself included) and don’t want to deal with an external device. That said: video calls are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;kind of a pain on iPadOS&lt;/a&gt; (in part because the camera is still on the side, in landscape mode), and, as I noted above, multitasking during them is a lot harder than it is on a MacBook. macOS and the iPad’s camera hardware seem like a good fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqmEPQ"&gt;There’s also the larger iPad’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Liquid Retina XDR display&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like it’s going to be a game-changer. Incorporating over 10,000 Mini LEDs, it’s said to reach 1,000 nits of brightness (which is brighter than many 4K HDR TVs on the market). And 1,000-nit Windows laptops exist (as do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056429/msis-creator-17-laptop-mini-led-1000-nits-hdr-4k"&gt;Mini LED laptops&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s uncommon to see them under the $2,000 price point. This isn’t hardware that the average office user needs — but in a laptop, it would be one of the best screens you can get at its price point, hands down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxIcAN"&gt;Now, would an iPad Pro running macOS be the right purchase for everyone? Of course not. Not everyone wants to work on a 12.9-inch screen all day. I’ll admit that I’d probably find it cramped. I also know people who use the 12.3-inch Surface Pro 7 as their primary driver with no complaints. Many folks care more about having a full-featured PC in a convertible and super versatile form factor than they do about having a big screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOaS1B"&gt;That’s why I’m convinced there would be an audience for a convertible iPad Pro — especially if its performance and battery life are finally up to par with that of a MacBook. (The iPad Pro also has one fewer USB port, but that’s easily resolved with a dongle. Come on, people.) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here is the purple iPhone 12, which is purple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iW_qOjdrAN-ln6gAgylVTAJ-pe0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168438/vpavic_4547_20210421_0022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A purple iPhone 12&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNuuh3"&gt;Apple managed to surprise us during its live stream event earlier this week by announcing a new iPhone. Well, a new &lt;em&gt;color&lt;/em&gt; for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini: purple. Apple sent one to us along with some sample AirTags and so we have duly taken some photos of this, a purple iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrgmXw"&gt;It’s a lightish shade of purple. One might be tempted to call it lavender, but to me it’s a bit more like a lilac or maybe a wisteria. It lacks the redness you’d expect in a mauve or the blue tones you’d see in a violet. There are many &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_(color)"&gt;shades of purple&lt;/a&gt;, but this one is what Apple went with and I like it. It’s unmistakable even at a distance, whereas the light green iPhone 12 models could be mistaken for off-white in certain light. I am also glad it doesn’t have a fancy name. It’s just “purple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnU4Uy"&gt;The purple iPhone 12 is in all other ways the same as the other colors of the iPhone 12: it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;very fast, has a very nice screen, 5G, and great cameras&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just a little more royal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XlwYOe"&gt;Alongside the purple iPhone, Apple also released its AirTags location trackers. Here’s a first look at those:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag and the Find My app" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuJjx3uLgXhd5Bp9vyxoGP1gtsg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168440/vpavic_4547_20210421_0097.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An AirTag and the Find My app&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;They work super well, and they’re one more thing keeping you on the iPhone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="f3bzgq"&gt;I was starting to get really worried that I wouldn’t find my friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeS892"&gt;For this first look at AirTags, I sent Vjeran Pavic off into an unfamiliar city with a single Apple AirTag and no phone, no smartwatch, or any other mode of communication. The challenge was to see if Apple’s Find My system for locating AirTags would be able to lead me to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKAkp8"&gt;Apple AirTags weren’t designed for an elaborate game of hide-and-seek. They can help you locate anything they’re attached to; most of the time you’ll be listening for their little chirps as you hunt down the keys you inexplicably left sitting on top of the fridge instead of on the hook where they belong. For that purpose they work incredibly well, right on down to a little arrow on the iPhone’s screen pointing in the direction and little haptic taps as encouragement that you’re getting warmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPyX0j"&gt;But this exercise was a very good stress test for the new $29 iPhone accessory ($99 for a four pack), because it meant that the only chance I had of tracking Vjeran down is if one of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-introduces-airtag%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22396693%2Fapple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;near-billion&lt;/a&gt; Find My-enabled devices on the planet happened to pick up the AirTag’s Bluetooth signal and send it back to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RLUSJr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It only took a couple of passing iPhones to accurately locate an AirTag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IbWZ9W"&gt;After a half-hour of walking around, I finally found him. He was standing on a street corner with no foot traffic whatsoever, which meant that the intermittent signals I got detailing his location came from a couple of iPhones in cars that were driving by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sG4SFn"&gt;That’s impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvexyC"&gt;AirTags have been rumored for years but never seemed to materialize. They’re really here now and though I wouldn’t go so far as to say they’re worth the wait, I do think Apple has put together a thoughtfully designed system that goes a long way toward ensuring privacy and safety while still making it easier for you to locate your stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtRueK"&gt;AirTags are a very Apple-y Apple product, and that ends up being great but also just a little annoying (and, for third-party companies like Tile, troubling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FhLnnx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here is the purple iPhone 12, which is purple ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22160543"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AirTags" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qPeprEY3uZnYIrPxafC5-14_lS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461387/vpavic_4547_20210421_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirTags&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ikPenn"&gt;The basics of AirTags are simple enough to understand: each one is a tiny little puck with a Bluetooth Low Energy radio and a U1 ultra-wideband (UWB) chip. You pair it with your iPhone just like you do with AirPods, holding it nearby and then tapping through a short setup process. After that, they’re available in a new “Items” tab in the Find My app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zhkyu"&gt;From the app, you can set the AirTags to chirp, mark them as lost (which enables some different features), or just tap the button that lets you locate them in space. If you have an iPhone with UWB, it can locate the AirTag in physical space and point a little arrow at it when you get within four feet or so. It all works very well and is very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple keychain accessory" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RV4V3dolejjqJ3ffVAvRQcROfzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461382/vpavic_4547_20210421_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AirTag in an Apple keychain accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6HtVcSHgAaaBhX6TuKfMTrj7XVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461386/vpavic_4547_20210421_0070.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TBtYbz"&gt;From a design perspective, an AirTag is &lt;em&gt;classic&lt;/em&gt; Apple. It’s a white and shiny silver little button, and you can have custom emoji or letters printed on the plastic. They are as cute as the buttons they resemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjMn8K"&gt;However, you’ll soon find the plastic is scuffed and the chrome on the back is scratched. Sincerely, do not expect these to stay looking pristine for long — not since the weird early days of the iPod nano has an Apple product gotten scuffed this easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HcPV4Y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here’s the scuffs and scratches on an AirTag after a few hours of handling. I don’t think we did anything excessive here either. I mean it’s not a huge deal that this happens but it’s still pretty weird! &lt;a href="https://t.co/kkD2A6OhCn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kkD2A6OhCn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1385223768981733376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="18Zubv"&gt;One clever touch is that the plastic body itself serves as the speaker. It’s what vibrates to make the chirping noise. It gets plenty loud, though my old ears had a bit of a difficult time using just that sound to locate one. Also, if for whatever reason the AirTag is squeezed or compressed, that will dampen how loud it can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBCOhY"&gt;There’s also no hole on them for a lanyard loop. If you want to actually attach one to anything instead of dropping it in a pocket, you’ll need to buy an accessory. That, increasingly, also feels like a classic Apple move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GesLat"&gt;The one &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-Apple part of the design is that the battery is actually user-replaceable. A little twist of the bottom reveals a standard CR2032 cell, which Apple claims should be good for a year of battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/se0Xj94XLrepGAWvfBgQdxaRhSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461436/IMG_2741.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n00obOEmwKOlY40OBccRkzNCyLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461435/IMG_2742.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EtKqBR"&gt;The real trick — and the hidden complexity — arises when you are tracking an AirTag out in the world, when something is truly lost. Like everything in Apple’s Find My network, the AirTag’s location is end-to-end encrypted so only you can see its location. But any iOS device can send that location to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlOWLw"&gt;If somebody comes upon a lost AirTag, they can tap it via NFC to see information about it, including its serial number (which could be important if you think it’s being used to track you). If the owner has put it in “Lost Mode,” they have the option to have that information page show their phone number and a brief message so you can contact them. This NFC feature works equally well with iPhones and Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPCQeu"&gt;That means all it takes to locate an AirTag is for any iPhone with Bluetooth on to see it — even if that iPhone is whizzing by in a car. Apple is leveraging its huge network of devices as a competitive advantage here — along with the competitive advantage of directly offering this functionality as a system-level feature. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/"&gt;Tile has asked Congress&lt;/a&gt; to look into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The pairing process for AirTags is just like pairing AirPods" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00YS7IOym90TTCaI-N9Z8H6Pk8o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461378/vpavic_4547_20210421_0032.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pairing process for AirTags is just like pairing AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6yT5cP"&gt;A Bluetooth device broadcasting anything is a potential privacy risk, so Apple is cycling each AirTag’s Bluetooth identifier “frequently.” More than that, though, Apple has also done some work to develop a system that also considers personal safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxuLSK"&gt;If the Find My network notices that an AirTag has been separated from its owner for a while and seems to be in the same place you are, it will alert you. If you’re an iPhone user, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;you’ll see a notification&lt;/a&gt; that says “AirTag Found Moving With You.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/my-JQ011JKmly4wAl-rJczGViMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461476/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A bunch of AirTags.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="Br9q28"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It tries to alert you if it thinks it’s being used to track you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fahKUR"&gt;Apple says that there are options to disable these “Safety Alerts” if you are “borrowing” something. But the real purpose is clear: to protect you from somebody using an AirTag to surreptitiously track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3GVuC"&gt;When you see the alert, you can tap the notification to get a screen that will allow you to make the AirTag start beeping. The alert will also instruct you on how to disable the AirTag by removing the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kUuSag"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aT8MXm"&gt;Finally, Apple says, “If you feel your safety is at risk, contact your local law enforcement who can work with Apple. You might need to provide the AirTag or its serial number.” Apple won’t be able to provide your location, but it could provide governments with information related to the person who registered the AirTag as theirs in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TzBRX"&gt;If you’re an Android user, well, virtually none of this is going to work for you. However, the AirTag does have at least one potential trick. If it’s been separated from its owner and then detects that it’s suddenly on the move, it will start beeping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsG7bO"&gt;All in all, I think it’s a thoughtfully designed system, but it’s also definitely one that leverages Apple’s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An AirTag" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tN1fzfEdBhCr_ZytOAxuh2IIq_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461379/vpavic_4547_20210421_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AirTag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r0aAf4"&gt;Really, the AirTag is the Most Apple Product I’ve seen in a while. It’s just a little more expensive than the competition. It’s beautifully designed, but its hardware still somehow fails to actually take the practical realities of our dirty, messy world into account. It’s very privacy-focused. It really only works with Apple devices. It offers features that no third-party device can really match thanks to Apple’s tight integration (or tight grip on its APIs, depending on your point of view). And since there’s no Android version of Find My, it’s another piece of the Apple ecosystem that’s going to keep you from switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQDaRB"&gt;An AirTag is a very Apple-y thing for Apple users who already live in Apple’s ecosystem. They work great — and will be great at keeping you in Apple’s world.&lt;/p&gt;
