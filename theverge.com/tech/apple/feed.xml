    <title>Here’s how the FBI managed to get into the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubJSyKrsXz4QSd1LPgSAZ15x2Uc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69126966/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xXeuJq"&gt;The FBI partnered with an Australian security firm called Azimuth Security to gain access to an iPhone linked to the 2015 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack"&gt;San Bernardino shooting&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/14/azimuth-san-bernardino-apple-iphone-fbi/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals. Before now, the methods the FBI used to get into the iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11380204/fbi-iphone-attack-san-bernardino-secret"&gt;were kept secret&lt;/a&gt;. It was only clear that Apple wasn’t involved, as the company had refused to build a backdoor into the phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook"&gt;kicking off a legal battle&lt;/a&gt; that only ended after the FBI successfully hacked the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feKSaT"&gt;The phone at the center of the fight was seized after its owner, Syed Rizwan Farook, perpetrated an attack that killed 14 people. The FBI attempted to get into the phone but was unable to due to the iOS 9 feature that would erase the phone after a certain number of failed password attempts. Apple attempted to help the FBI in other ways but refused to build a passcode bypass system for the bureau, saying that such a backdoor would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/28/11321700/apple-responds-fbi-iphone-hack"&gt;permanently decrease the security of its phones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2g2ZL7"&gt;After the FBI announced that it had gained access to the phone, there were concerns that Apple’s security could have been deeply compromised. But according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, the exploit was simple: Azimuth basically found a way to guess the passcode as many times as it wanted without erasing the phone, allowing the bureau to get into the phone in a matter of hour&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ybmlH"&gt;The technical details of how the auto-erase feature was bypassed are fascinating. The actual hacking was reportedly done by two Azimuth employees who gained access to the phone by exploiting a vulnerability in an upstream software module written by Mozilla. That code was reportedly used by Apple in iPhones to enable the use of accessories with the Lightning port. Once the hackers gained initial access, they were able to chain together two more exploits, which gave them full control over the main processor, allowing them to run their own code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsFFRg"&gt;After they had this power, they were able to write and test software that guessed every passcode combination, ignoring any other systems that would lock out or erase the phone. The exploit chain, from Lightning port to processor control, was named Condor. As with many exploits, though, it didn’t last long. Mozilla reportedly fixed the Lightning port exploit a month or two later as part of a standard update, which was then adopted by the companies using the code, including Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyjrGn"&gt;In the end, not much happened as a result of the effort. The FBI &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11463672/apple-fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-contents-no-leads"&gt;reportedly didn’t get any useful information from the phone&lt;/a&gt;, and the bureau never got to set a legal precedent about whether the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/29/11325030/apple-fbi-iphone-hack-security-encryption-what-comes-next"&gt;could compel companies to compromise the security of their devices&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/1/16393074/apple-iphone-fbi-hacking-tool-san-bernardino-case-secret-court-order"&gt;a judge ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the FBI didn’t have to reveal how it had gotten into the iPhone, or who had helped it, due to concern that the mystery firm would face cybersecurity attacks as backlash for helping the FBI if its identity was made public.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now run Windows 10 on Arm on Apple’s M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hd348uUWglR-7jsmL8cj6CzhY8s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125225/vpavic_4291_20201113_0326.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s M1 MacBook Air.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EJirpl"&gt;Parallels is releasing an update to its Desktop virtual machine software that allows M1 Mac owners to install Windows 10 on Arm. Parallels Desktop 16.5 now includes the necessary native support to run the Arm version of Windows on M1 chips, following Apple’s decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp"&gt;not to support Boot Camp on M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9rHvi"&gt;The latest version of Parallels Desktop for Mac now allows M1 Mac owners to run Windows 10 on Arm apps or traditional x86 apps side by side with Mac or iOS apps on Big Sur. There will be some app limitations on the Windows 10 on Arm side, thanks to its own app emulation, but Windows 10 on Arm will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495510/microsoft-windows-on-arm-x64-app-emulation"&gt;soon support x64 app emulation&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wkq3JKuRChX6A7m9w4MhsGJWJLA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22443416/windowsonmacm1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10 running on an M1 MacBook Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9kPZ5"&gt;Parallels Desktop maker Corel says its latest update also results in some impressive performance and battery improvements over running the software on Intel-based Macs. According to Corel, the 16.5 update uses up to 250 percent less energy on an M1 Mac, compared to an Intel-based MacBook Air. There’s also a promise of up to 60 percent better DirectX 11 performance and up to 30 percent better overall virtual machine performance running the Arm version of Windows 10 on an M1 Mac instead of a Windows 10 VM on an Intel-based MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkhMJY"&gt;The main drawback is that you’ll need to run a preview version of Windows to make this all work. Microsoft only currently licenses the Arm version of Windows 10 to PC makers, so there’s no official way to buy a copy yet. The software maker does provide a Windows 10 on Arm preview build, which can be &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2FwindowsinsiderpreviewARM64" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;downloaded from Microsoft’s Windows Insider website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfoBvI"&gt;Alongside the Windows 10 on Arm support, Parallels Desktop 16.5 for Mac also supports Linux distros like Ubuntu 20.04, Kali Linux 2021.1, Debian 10.7, and Fedora Workstation 33-1.2.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest you can grab a pair right now is for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/apple-airpods-pro-mwp22am-a-in-the-ear-bluetooth-headset-white/product_24422954?storeId=10001&amp;amp;AID=10921729&amp;amp;PID=4485850&amp;amp;SID=fa73db569d2011eb83a05281c35caba30INT&amp;amp;cvosrc=affiliate.cj.4485850&amp;amp;cvo_campaign=Coupon&amp;amp;cm_mmc=CJ-_-4485850-_-4485850-_-10921729&amp;amp;CID=AFF%3A4485850%3A4485850%3A10921729&amp;amp;CJPIXEL=CJPIXEL&amp;amp;cjevent=faa926699d2011eb824c01890a82b82a&amp;amp;dclid=CO2H2dLk_e8CFcmnnwod0Y4CCQ&amp;amp;userEnv=&amp;amp;tenantId=StaplesDotCom&amp;amp;locale=en-US&amp;amp;zipCode=21638&amp;amp;channel=WEB&amp;amp;encode=" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199 at Staples&lt;/a&gt; or $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Apple trusts Phobio for its trade-ins, but maybe you should think twice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PGDlMMOIKhiIpL540VrCAgCCb6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123829/acastro_210408_4519_phobio_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based firm is the behind-the-scenes operator of Apple’s trade-in program, and its online reputation raises questions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qPAV1C"&gt;When Daniel McGloin decided to trade in his mid-2017 Apple MacBook in February of this year, he thought he was getting a pretty good deal. The software engineer and San Diego native initiated the trade-in with Apple through the Apple Store mobile app, where he was quoted $350 for his used laptop. He felt it was in pretty good condition, with no apparent damage to the case and a fully functioning display and keyboard. So McGloin packed up the device and shipped it in, expecting to receive his money in the coming weeks, which would help offset his purchase of a MacBook Air carrying Apple’s new M1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5kb94"&gt;The situation soon changed after his laptop arrived for inspection. Suddenly, McGloin was told his MacBook was worth just $140, less than half what Apple originally quoted. The mysterious culprit: “display has 3 or more white spots,” the Apple Store app told him. It’s a defect McGloin doesn’t remember ever seeing, and one that he should have noticed: typically, white spots on an LCD display are evidence of serious damage or burn-in and are clearly visible. In McGloin’s estimation, however, the laptop was in “excellent” condition, he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and he didn’t see any white spots when he packed it up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKProV"&gt;So McGloin decided to search around online, where he discovered a lesser-known fact about Apple’s trade-in program. The company he had been dealing with was not actually Apple, but an Atlanta-based contractor named Phobio. Founded in 2010, Phobio is an enterprise service provider that specializes in offering white label trade-in services other companies can pass off as their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CGiyU"&gt;McGloin also found Phobio had a pretty questionable online reputation when it came to Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Daniel McGloin sent in his 2017 MacBook after receiving a quote of $350, only to have his quote marked down to $140. “Display has 3 or more white spots,” was the reason, though &lt;/em&gt;The Verge &lt;em&gt;found no such issue when it inspected the computer in person. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uCsfUn"&gt;“It’s here I realized that number one, the trade-in program is not run by Apple, number two, there are lots of people observing the same behavior, and number three, this seems to be a new development in the last few months,” McGloin says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXOd1m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;inspected McGloin’s MacBook in person after he rejected the trade-in offer and Phobio returned the computer to him. We could detect no such white spots or any discernible damage whatsoever. The laptop booted up and operates like new, and it has since passed numerous online diagnostic tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7A7A6i"&gt;It’s not clear why McGloin’s estimate was halved. But his experience is indicative of a common belief that’s emerged about Phobio online — that the company stiffs owners of Apple products out of hundreds of dollars in trade-in value — and the supposed “3 or more white spots” defect seems unlikely enough that it bears investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P349GE"&gt;Two other people who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and provided documentation of their Phobio trade-in processes also experienced a similar situation, in which “white spots” or other supposed defects, only detected after the device was shipped to a Phobio facility, resulted in reduced trade-in quotes. And that’s just a tiny sample of an online torrent of complaints against Phobio and its practices across multiple types of gadgets and with an alarming uptick in the last few months. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another Apple customer, Carlos Pero, had their laptop marked down from $640 to $210 over display white spots Phobio claims it detected. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RD0mEQ"&gt;“Having used it for three years, I can tell you I never noticed a problem,” Carlos Pero, another Apple customer who had their laptop trade-in quote reduced by Phobio from $640 to $210, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Pero also asked for his laptop back, and Phobio returned it. Upon inspection, Pero could not detect any issues with his computer, and he showed us a video of his MacBook Pro booting up to verify there were no “white spots” present. “Maybe they have some diagnostic tool? But from a consumer perspective, no way I see a problem before I sent it or after receiving it back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0395H"&gt;Pero says he was never given any photographic proof of the white spots when his trade-in was adjusted. “They sent no such thing. Just the notification of the change in value and essentially the take-it-or-leave-it message which came by way of Apple,” he says. “I imagine it would be a tougher choice for someone who was counting on realizing the full value of the trade-in, who may not be able to afford a new computer otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzUT3y"&gt;Scores of other instances of this exact situation happening to Apple product owners can be found online, too, with numerous customers citing Phobio’s “3 or more white spots” explanation as the reason for their adjusted trade-in, as well as stories of other types of apparent damage detected only after sending a device in for inspection. This isn’t just restricted to MacBooks, either. Customers often complain of reduced trade-in quotes for iPhones, iPads, and iMacs, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiJjaH"&gt;In some cases, like McGloin’s, Phobio’s name never comes up, so customers are left with the impression Apple inspected it and reduced their quote accordingly. “The only real ‘correspondence’ I had with Apple and Phobio were the interactions in the Apple Store app. I didn’t otherwise contact them through email or phone,” McGloin says. He tells us he was faced with the tough decision to either accept less than half the promised money or try to sell his computer elsewhere after going through the hassle of wiping it clean and shipping it. “I’m actually a pretty big Apple fan, but this feels off-brand and pretty shady,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A mid-2017 Apple MacBook Phobio says was worth $140, down from $350, due to “3 or more white spots” in the display. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; could find no evidence of white spots. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MoZ7rk"&gt;Apple often prides itself on customer service and in handling many of its sales operations in-house. So the use of a third-party vendor not advertised publicly on its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22368541%2Fapple-trade-in-phobio-macbook-white-spots" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;trade-in website&lt;/a&gt; — even in receipts, Apple only refers to an unnamed “trade-in partner” — is a peculiar approach for the iPhone maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdXGh5"&gt;Outsourcing trade-ins is common in the industry, though. Many businesses pick white-label inspection and recycling firms to cut costs and avoid the hassle of managing a cumbersome operation. Phobio also happens to be the &lt;a href="https://www.phobio.com/blog/phobio-partners-with-oneplus-to-power-its-trade-in-program-in-north-america"&gt;trade-in partner of OnePlus in the US&lt;/a&gt;, and the firm also &lt;a href="https://www.phobio.com/blog/phobio-named-trade-in-provider-to-three-new-companies-amazon-canada-hyperion-partners-and-drone-nerds"&gt;inked a deal with Amazon Canada just last month&lt;/a&gt; to handle trade-ins of “certain eligible mobile phones, laptops, iPads and Apple watches.” It handles trade-ins for Costco and B&amp;amp;H Photo, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E53zad"&gt;Yet for Apple, which stakes its reputation on quality control, the negative experiences customers report having with Phobio threaten to undermine the image Apple has cultivated as a customer-obsessed product company, which, in turn, helps justify the company’s high-priced consumer tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAL5nD"&gt;Apple tells us Phobio is not the only company that helps manage its US trade-in program, but it wouldn’t name any others — and we verified that every type of product you’d trade in at Apple.com (computers, phones, tablets, and watches) is currently handled by Phobio in the United States. Apple also has a trade-in partner named Brightstar servicing Canada and other parts of the globe, but two Brightstar employees told us it no longer accepts US trade-ins. One referred us to Phobio specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2frVDX"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://mixergy.com/interviews/phobio-with-stephen-wakeling/"&gt;podcast interview with Phobio founder and CEO Stephen Wakeling&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 includes vague details on the partnership. At one point, Wakeling tells the podcast host he’s not sure Apple would permit him to talk further about the program. Some &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/20/apple-mac-trade-in-partner-phobio/"&gt;news posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/71vctg/psa_do_not_use_apples_trade_in_partner_phobio/"&gt;forum threads as far back as 2017&lt;/a&gt; mention Phobio as Apple’s trade-in partner, but it’s not clear how long the two have been in business; Apple first began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/30/4675768/apple-launches-iphone-trade-in-program-retail-stores"&gt;accepting used iPhones at its retail stores in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and the Apple trade-in program has since expanded to include close to its full lineup of hardware products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LsTWh"&gt;It’s not like customers could just walk into an Apple Store to avoid Phobio, at least not where laptops are concerned. Up until &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/17/mac-trade-ins-retail-stores/"&gt;last summer&lt;/a&gt;, Mac trade-ins, unlike with iPhones or iPads, were not eligible for in-store inspections by Apple employees at the company’s retail locations. Macs had to be sent in the mail, where Apple’s trade-in partner Phobio steps in. (Due to COVID-19 store closures and limitations on in-store services, it’s likely many customers have kept using the mail-in service for Macs.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrQYoS"&gt;And even a cursory Google search on Phobio and its handling of Apple trade-ins returns &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=phobio+scam+site:www.reddit.com&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS896US897&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbq9Gf2PHvAhXNieAKHQKMBdsQrQIoBHoECAUQBQ&amp;amp;biw=2048&amp;amp;bih=941"&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252009512?page=3"&gt;upon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/knkt9h/advice_do_not_attempt_to_try_apple_mac_tradein/"&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252160186"&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252160186"&gt;board &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ka5no3/did_phobio_actually_deliver_the_price_they/"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt; detailing bad experiences and a &lt;a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/ga/kennesaw/profile/ecommerce/phobio-llc-0443-27756683/complaints"&gt;Better Business Bureau page&lt;/a&gt; with more than 500 complaints and new entries added almost every day. Many of these complaints are recent, and some are from Apple customers wondering openly if they’ve been a victim of some type of fraud or whether Phobio is a legitimate company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1msgL6"&gt;When some customers complained, they reported Phobio’s provided proof &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/a57h7w/anyone_else_get_scammed_by_apples_trade_in/"&gt;consisted of grainy images&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bad-phobio-trade-in-experience-merged.2069167/page-3"&gt;didn’t show clear-cut evidence&lt;/a&gt;. Some customers have &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/knkt9h/advice_do_not_attempt_to_try_apple_mac_tradein/"&gt;detailed how they took photos of their devices&lt;/a&gt; prior to shipping them in in the event of disputes, only for Phobio to return photographic evidence they say either &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/j0F22nX"&gt;doesn’t illustrate the alleged issue or is too low-quality or obfuscating&lt;/a&gt; to serve as proper proof. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I know what everyone is going to say. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; is just being apple. But when you offer me $120 to trade-in my old device and then drop that offer to $30 for an imaginary "white spot", that is BS. What white spot?!?!? You put the red sticker to identify it but I don't see it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gnAyp044x0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gnAyp044x0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— A Mindful Minx (@TweetaVonTease) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TweetaVonTease/status/1325812118789234695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UEzniV"&gt;A large number of the complaints about Phobio have a common theme: a MacBook or iPhone that seems to be in perfect working order, only for the device to later have an unexplained deficiency. Phobio, which is at that point in possession of the device, then offers the customer the option to accept the reduced quote or ask for the product to be shipped back. (Phobio does offer to ship the product both ways for free.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kRVFW"&gt;This presents a thorny set of choices for a device owner, primarily by seeding self-doubt as to the real value of the product they’re hoping to trade in and what their best option might be. What if the product did have the damage beforehand and they simply didn’t notice or perhaps something happened during transit? Maybe Phobio is using a proprietary diagnostic tool that reveals something no consumer could ever find on their own? What if, by some stroke of bad luck, the device was somehow damaged during transit, and you’d have a hard time using it or selling it somewhere else if you ask for it back? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pretty disappointed in Apple’s trade in vendor. Trade in value dropped from $490 to $180 after “three white spots” magically appeared on my old MBP while in transit. Certainly feels like bait and switch on that one.&lt;/p&gt;— Rob Zimmerman (@taintedzodiac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/taintedzodiac/status/1341763871145603072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rs4yGg"&gt;Chris Dwan calls his experience with Phobio a “pretty straightforward bait and switch,” telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that he mailed in his MacBook Air with an expected trade-in value of $370, only for it to be knocked down to $150 for damage to the outer shell he suspects happened during transit or inspection. “At that point it was take-it-or-leave-it. They did offer to ship the laptop back, but I caved and took my $150.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZPgLP6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At that point it was take-it-or-leave-it. They did offer to ship the laptop back, but I caved and took my $150.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wkF26E"&gt;At the end of the day, someone trading in their used Apple device is looking to get rid of it and hoping they’ll get a little cash for their trouble, instead of simply recycling it or leaving it to collect dust. That could make them easy to take advantage of: many are likely willing to take what they can get, rather than spend additional time and energy trying to get satisfaction from a company that’s holding all the cards, particularly when it’s not clear who’s to blame or whether their product is actually damaged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKaf4O"&gt;“White spots” or no, it’s not surprising that a company like Phobio would be facing loads of complaints. Every company working in customer service is likely to have its fair share of disgruntled customers complaining online; people with positive experiences tend to have little reason to share those stories with the world. Trade-in programs can involve especially fraught negotiations because of the money involved and the fear customers harbor of being scammed. Even rightful adjustments to trade-in quotes might inspire someone to leave a negative review or feel as if they’ve been had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So upset at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt;.

So mad!!&lt;/p&gt;— Mari (@Busyspider23) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Busyspider23/status/1313807676388913152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fJhJ4K"&gt;In fact, many people have reported positive experiences with Phobio — many never realizing they weren’t dealing with Apple directly. One &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer says they were even given more money for an Apple trade-in after the device exceeded the quality estimate they were initially quoted on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgOxa8"&gt;Phobio customer service representatives can also be seen replying to almost every single tweet, tagging the company’s support account, and Better Business Bureau post, asking how to remedy the situation. In the latter cases, many of the customers who complained post to the bureau’s website after the fact saying Phobio resolved their issues with fixed trade-in values or Apple Store gift cards to make up the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gWwiM"&gt;In a tour of one of its so-called aggregation facilities &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F524211358&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22368541%2Fapple-trade-in-phobio-macbook-white-spots" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;posted to LinkedIn last month&lt;/a&gt;, a Phobio representative shed some light on how Apple products are evaluated. “We have very simple grading criteria. We only have two of course, which is working and damaged to make it easy for folks at home to grade their own devices,” the representative explains, before transitioning to a Phobio employee inspecting a MacBook. “He’s making sure the screen is intact and functional, he’s making sure the keys function, and then he’s checking to see if there’s any wear or tear to the computer or any major dents or damage.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="uIbR1B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/524211358?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4qCi4D"&gt;“A couple of other things to look out for: LCD damage, screen spotting and dead pixels, cracked screen, missing or malfunctioning buttons, and large dents,” the representative says. When asked by Wakeling, Phobio’s CEO who appears on-screen at the beginning and end of the video, what the top issues are with devices sent in for trade-in, the representative simply says “screen delamination” or “any major damage” to the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ih2SE"&gt;In a Phobio &lt;a href="https://phobio.com/static/downloads/smb/inspection_guide.pdf"&gt;inspection guideline document&lt;/a&gt; posted online for business trade-ins (which may have different standards than consumer trade-ins), the company details its processes for inspecting products like iPhones and Macs. Under the display portion, the document says “a device is considered ‘Damaged’ if the display: is cracked, fractured and/or shows signs of delamination; does not function as designed (displaying single colors, lines, flickering); is scratched such that it affects readability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBOjNq"&gt;However, no mention of white spots can be found in the document, nor did Phobio mention that issue in its facility tour. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qNVP4joUclPK7XMznmZq9Oz1Wuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424867/Phobio_inspection_guide.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Phobio&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7tCAz7"&gt;You could chalk up these bad customer experiences with Phobio to the sheer volume of products Apple’s trade-in program likely deals in or discrepancies in the level of diligence of its individual employees. But that doesn’t explain the mystery of the white spots, and why we’ve seen perfectly functional MacBook computers have their trade-in value cut in half — or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tkXyB"&gt;What we do know about the white spots scenario is that it typically involves an Apple laptop in seemingly good condition quoted at one price, only for the trade-in estimate to be knocked down by more than 50 percent upon inspection. The common response from Phobio is that the display suffers from “3 or more white spots.” In McGloin’s case, these apparent spots were not detectable by a human eye before or after Phobio inspected the device. It doesn’t add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX65hJ"&gt;So we felt it necessary to ask Phobio if they had a reasonable explanation for cases like these that went beyond the standard “screen spotting,” “dead pixels,” and other general LCD damage that would be perceptible by looking at the screen yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kWmAfK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We struggled to find any form of contact information for Phobio’s public relations department&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WV8jKe"&gt;Phobio did not have a media contact line or any other form of public-facing public relations department we were able to locate for this story. We did, however, contact a third-party PR representative for Phobio, who forwarded our questions to the company. We repeatedly asked for the opportunity to speak on the record with an official Phobio representative about our findings, but we were ultimately denied. We instead sent a series of questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUyglY"&gt;Phobio would not comment directly on the white spots issue, and it would not offer an explanation as to what tools it uses to evaluate MacBook displays or why it seems some customers have had their trade-in quotes adjusted because of the alleged white spots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFr7ZU"&gt;When asked, Phobio would not say how long it’s been Apple’s trade-in partner or if it is Apple’s only US trade-in partner, and the company would not comment on the financial terms of its contract, including whether Phobio or Apple gets to keep and resell the devices customers send in. Phobio would also not say whether it receives any guidance from Apple on how to inspect products and make adjustments to trade-in quotes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9nqeB"&gt;Phobio would also not tell us how frequently it negatively adjusted Apple trade-in quotes by up to or more than half. It would also not say how often customers accept these lowered adjustments versus rejecting them and asking for the product back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEa4Ce"&gt;In the end, Phobio would only provide this statement: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1HGUEE"&gt;We carefully assess each device sent to us, and only change the initial quote if the device we receive or its condition differs from what was initially indicated by the customer. We document our findings at every step of the way with photos that are shared with the customers. The customer can then agree to the revised quote, or if they do not, we express ship it back to them at our expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErGZy4"&gt;We specifically train our support team to see the trade from the point of view of the customer, with empathy, and to advocate for the customer. If devices are damaged in transit or we make a mistake in the inspection, we seek to fix it immediately. We strongly believe in giving full and fair value to customers for their trade ins. This helps fuel the circular economy, and sustainability, and it is part of our corporate purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FksqvY"&gt;Apple declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QE2ADB"&gt;As for McGloin, he’s not sure what’s he’s going to do now with his returned MacBook. “I actually have no idea. I’m not really aware of alternative trade-in options,” he says, adding that he has in the past opted to donate used products or gifted them to a friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="zQaJqH"&gt;For now, the computer sits packed up in Phobio’s shipping box, with no visible white spots and no explanation as to how a perfectly functional Apple laptop from four years ago could now be considered worth less than a pair of AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODp9ej"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next year’s iPhones will have 48-megapixel cameras and no mini option: Kuo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWq6kGonFQK3rK2AwFJRrC7OjRo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123372/vpavic_4279_20201107_0094.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1evF1E"&gt;The 2022 iPhone lineup will feature substantial changes to the camera system, according to analyst Ming-chi Kuo in an investor note reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2022-iphones-no-mini-upgraded-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/14/kuo-48mp-camera-with-8k-support-coming-to-iphone-in-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo says the high-end iPhones — presumably the Pro range — will use a larger 48-megapixel sensor for the primary camera. Separately, the analyst suggests that 2023 iPhones may start to use Face ID sensors under the screen as a way to get rid of the notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnH08t"&gt;48-megapixel sensors have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/22/18192579/honor-view-20-48-megapixel-camera-review"&gt;common in Android phones for years&lt;/a&gt;, but this component will reportedly be larger than most. It’ll be a 1/1.3-inch sensor with a pixel size of 1.25µm, according to Kuo. That’s smaller than the 1.7µm pixels in the iPhone 12 Pro Max, but Kuo says that the equivalent pixel size will be more like 2.5µm when the sensor is used for 12-megapixel images. Kuo also expects the higher-resolution sensor to enable 8K video capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FZVE5e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple may ditch the iPhone mini in 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwCn04"&gt;The 2022 iPhone lineup is going to see a reduction in screen size options, Kuo says; there won’t be a 5.4-inch mini any more, and Apple will stick to the 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays on other models. The mini has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;not sold to Apple’s expectations&lt;/a&gt;, with the company said to have overestimated demand and cut production orders. The 2021 lineup, however, is expected to keep the same screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDY4ZP"&gt;Finally, Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2023-iphones-under-display-face-id/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone will begin to use an under-display Face ID system in 2023. Kuo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will replace the Face ID notch with a hole-punch camera in some models from next year, and that 2023 will also see under-display fingerprint scanners come to the iPhone. It’s not clear exactly which technologies will make it out when, or in which combination.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple officially announces Spring Loaded event for April 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTL7G2zZyAsAExeV48EpMHNwwcE=/0x0:1770x1180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69119219/appleinvite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s April 20th event invite.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iSD9V1"&gt;Apple’s next event will take place on April 20th, the company announced today, with an invite teasing the upcoming event with a “Spring Loaded” tagline. The official confirmation came just hours after the company’s voice assistant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381336/siri-apple-event-april-20th-ipad-pro-announcement-launch"&gt;revealed the date early&lt;/a&gt; when asked “When is the next Apple event?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8jMEH"&gt;As is typical, there’s not much to go on from the invitation, although the squiggly Apple logo and “spring loaded” tagline could hint at a new Apple Pencil stylus — perhaps one with some sort of clickable button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nekj6J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So excited for this one! Only seven more days.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/PVJFcESqh8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PVJFcESqh8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1382004503155634179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4gTnE7"&gt;The timing of the event does favor an announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;new iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;, too. Although the new 11- and 12.9-inch tablets are expected to have a similar design to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;last year’s models&lt;/a&gt;, the larger version will reportedly be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;Apple’s first with a Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt;. Other rumored improvements include a faster processor with performance in line with the M1 chip Apple used in its recent Macs, upgraded USB-C ports, and better cameras. A new iPad mini with a larger 8.5- to 9-inch screen (up from 7.9 inches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;last time around&lt;/a&gt;) is also reportedly coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259365/apple-10-8-9-inch-ipad-mini-ming-chi-kuo-ar-glasses-headset"&gt;in the first half of this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMBbA1"&gt;Another contender to appear at the event is Apple’s AirTags, Apple’s long-rumored Tile competitor. References to the trackers, which are thought to make use of the ultra-wideband technology that debuted in the iPhone 11, appeared in iOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936650/apple-airtag-tile-device-reference-ios-13-2-rumors"&gt;as early as 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But despite reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;entering mass production last year&lt;/a&gt;, they’ve yet to be officially announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W0QViF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is reportedly working on new iMacs, MacBooks, and AirPods for this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LJpRnA"&gt;Beyond the devices Apple is rumored to be announcing imminently, there are a couple of others that are believed to be on the way for this year, which also have a chance of making an appearance next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZJFj5"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;revamp of its iMac lineup this year&lt;/a&gt;, as it transitions the Macs to its own Apple Silicon processors. Rumored changes include slimmer bezels and a design that resembles the Pro Display XDR. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316831/apple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last"&gt;Apple confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it would stop selling the current base model of the iMac Pro once supplies run out, suggesting Apple is poised to announce new models sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLYSOA"&gt;There have also been reports that new MacBook Pros and a new MacBook Air are coming this year. The laptops are rumored to see a return of fan-favorite features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;MagSafe charging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244398/apple-2021-macbook-pro-sd-card-slot-report-ports-refresh"&gt;SD card slots&lt;/a&gt;, while the MacBook Pro’s divisive Touch Bar could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;on the way out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CUdJf"&gt;Then there’s Apple’s AirPods. A new version of the true wireless earbuds is reportedly on the way and could arrive as early as the first half of 2021. That’s according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;, which said the new AirPods will come with AirPods Pro-style elements like shorter stems and replaceable ear tips. There are also new AirPods Pro earbuds on the way, which could ditch the stem entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PC2Xy5"&gt;Finally, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reported last year that Apple could release an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;upgraded Apple TV in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Reportedly, this year’s model will be focused on gaming and will feature a new remote, updated processor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;and 120Hz support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite music streaming services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="pryma-headphones-lopatto-street" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i2R-fCgyBoTiOIuTD70ahVkGo0Y=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118750/20150708-pryma-headphones--beyonce-review-liz-lopatto-1.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tyler Pena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VbwpXn"&gt;No matter what you do during your waking hours — work at home or outside of it; commute in a car, a train, or by walking from your bedroom to your living room; or spend your days watching the kids or job hunting — you’re probably spending at least some of that time listening to music. But where do you find that music? And if you already have a site you go to regularly, would you like to try something new?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNGJI6"&gt;There is a wealth of streaming music services now available to anyone who wants to listen and experiment. Some offer both free and paid subscription versions. Others are completely free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y77Exj"&gt;We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to tell us about their favorite music streaming services. Some listen to major outlets such as Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music, while others have discovered lesser-known but interesting venues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRXfMc"&gt;Here’s what they recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GUIs2e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://early1900s.org/radiodismuke/"&gt;Radio Dismuke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Radio Dismuke" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypm4U5-BKUq9FeUwCR6U_DCW-ps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433162/e1900mpbanner.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radio Dismuke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CoFwJk"&gt;For some reason, my partner and I have become addicted to the popular music of the early 20th century, mostly the 1920s and ’30s. Over the past few years, we’ve become happily familiar with the sounds of Cliff Edwards, Bessie Smith, Ruth Etting, Annette Hanshaw, Paul Whiteman, Cab Calloway, and Ethel Waters. (Here she is, in one of her sadly few motion picture appearances, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/AGNlLs0yquE"&gt;singing “Birmingham Bertha.”&lt;/a&gt;) So we spend a lot of time listening to Radio Dismuke, a little-known streaming service sponsored by &lt;a href="https://early1900s.org/"&gt;Early 1900s Music Preservation&lt;/a&gt;, which gives us a constant diet of pop and jazz from the early part of the last century. &lt;em&gt;—Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LCSpdv"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XOoqPt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://somafm.com/"&gt;Soma fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Soma fm" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXjVhrBV67Lyhk3bsi3hMQPyxNE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438117/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_10.59.49_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soma fm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CtcihK"&gt;Soma fm started life as an actual micropower radio station in San Francisco in 1999 but flipped over to the internet in 2000. It has been one of my go-to audio sources ever since. The site has tons of different genre stations. While working, I bounce between &lt;a href="https://somafm.com/groovesalad/"&gt;Groove Salad&lt;/a&gt; (ambient / downtempo), &lt;a href="https://somafm.com/secretagent/"&gt;Secret Agent&lt;/a&gt; (think classic Bond meets modern sensibilities), and &lt;a href="https://somafm.com/dronezone/"&gt;Drone Zone&lt;/a&gt; (very chill). In the early 2000s, &lt;a href="https://somafm.com/indiepop/"&gt;Indie Pop Rocks&lt;/a&gt; was my secret weapon for finding new bands my friends didn’t know yet. When the holidays come around, Soma’s holiday stations will make your party twice as festive and half as corny. There are apps for it on all platforms, but if you’re using &lt;a href="https://tunein.com/"&gt;TuneIn&lt;/a&gt; for terrestrial radio, Soma’s stations are listed there, too. It’s all free, but if you use it a lot, find a way to chip in a bit — after more than 20 years of streaming, Soma deserves it. &lt;em&gt;—Dieter Bohn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DVfZco"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yDTwkM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="YouTube Music" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FvhgbIdej5p8zC3HBCg0Wg0E4XI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433269/Screen_Shot_2021_04_09_at_4.08.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube Music&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir4Zp4"&gt;Most of my time on YouTube isn’t spent watching videos; it’s listening to music. YouTube Music is everything I wanted out of Google Play Music, plus some. Its catalog of music is incomparable, mostly thanks to users who upload music that otherwise isn’t available on streaming services. It has recent hits and full albums if you want to use it like, say, Spotify, but it’s my destination for listening to uploads of older music or obscure tunes, live performances, and compilations of video game soundtracks. (For some reason, I know the &lt;em&gt;Ghost Trick&lt;/em&gt; original soundtrack by heart, yet I haven’t played much of the game.) I’m always a little concerned that my favorite playlist or an upload of a hard-to-find album will be delisted, but perhaps it’s that rush that keeps me listening to it more often than any other music streaming service these days. —&lt;em&gt;Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vXjq46"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fNFgaW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://8tracks.com/"&gt;8tracks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="8tracks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnV4TxM5_mkPQBznI8uDXYjRxXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22437975/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_10.16.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;8tracks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WvJdHb"&gt;I’ll confess that I don’t listen to 8tracks regularly these days, but using it is a predictable way to trigger a burst of nostalgia. The streaming service launched in 2008, and it lets users upload playlists of at least eight songs (aka 8 tracks). You can search through playlists based on their tags (which could include artists, genre, or “mood”), but you can’t see the list of songs ahead of time. They’re revealed as you listen. You also only get three skips per playlist per hour. The forced discovery helped me find songs and artists I never would have listened to. 8tracks shut down in December 2019 but was brought back to life by a new startup called BackBeat last April. All of the playlists I made in high school are still intact, but they are very embarrassing — so I’m keeping that username a secret. &lt;em&gt;—Nicole Wetsman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MjhSxT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gvHP7s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://kexp.org/"&gt;KEXP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="KEXP" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWsNPReD6ChVD_PES5JoXsw1M38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438001/kexp_logo_official_notmutant_bw.jpg__344x459_q85_crop_subject_location_172_229_subsampling_2_upscale.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: KEXP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;KEXP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="njqWRm"&gt;KEXP, a public radio station based in Seattle, is my favorite radio station in the world. It primarily plays alternative and indie rock, but there are also weekly blocks with completely different genres like blues, Latin music, songs entirely by Pacific Northwest-based artists, and my wife and I especially enjoy reggae on Saturday mornings. We regularly stream the station to our kitchen speaker while eating dinner or doing chores. The music selection is consistently excellent, and it’s also a regular reminder of the city where we met and fell in love. —&lt;em&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3Cth6T"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FBgjhy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.auxlive.com/browse"&gt;Aux Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Aux Live" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0GqqNQ8Z6wmaOprMpFON_-R4Lw0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438023/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_10.33.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aux Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SKEP2u"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s resident Post Malone fan, I recently discovered Aux Live when a recording of his performance at PostyFest in 2019 was featured. My first intention was to only keep the subscription long enough to watch that one concert, but I ended up really enjoying the service. Aux Live is a music-focused service with a range of live concerts and documentaries across an expansive range of genres and legendary artists. It works both in-browser and via app. It costs $4.99 a month, but that feels reasonable given the vast number of artists featured in the service. &lt;em&gt;—Kaitlin Hatton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JYumTP"&gt;After purchasing a portable DAC to listen to higher-resolution music on my phone, I was looking for a place where I can actually &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to higher-resolution music. I found Qobuz, which allows you to stream songs with up to a 192kHz sampling rate and 24-bit depth. You’re also able to buy hi-res songs or albums and download them from the Qobuz store without having to subscribe to the service. Revisiting some of my favorite albums that I listened to during my iPod days gave me a newfound appreciation for those recordings, and I ended up paying closer attention to the way they were mixed and mastered. &lt;em&gt;—Andru Marino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="HWiQki"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yKnuxx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/home/"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc9dla"&gt;Okay, fine — I’ll be the boring member of staff who recommends Spotify. Yes, other streaming services might offer better audio quality or curation, but Spotify has a nice user interface and compatibility with almost every piece of streaming hardware on the market, and that’s really all my basic music tastes require. And soon, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify HiFi launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;, audio quality will receive a big boost. It helps that I’ve been using Spotify for close to a decade at this point, so it has near-limitless data on me to create custom playlists tailored to my tastes. Its daily mixes are far from perfect, but they’re good enough that I regularly use them when I can’t be bothered to pick a specific band to listen to. &lt;em&gt;—Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y83IsX"&gt;I use Apple Music for a very specific reason: because it lets me listen to music that’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on Apple Music. Let me explain. A solid 10–15 percent of the music I listen to isn’t on Spotify or any streaming service. Whether it’s something I made or one of my friends made, a rip from a long-forgotten song posted to YouTube or SoundCloud, an album that’s &lt;a href="http://www.illegal-art.net/allday/"&gt;too copyright-infringement-astic&lt;/a&gt; to be allowed on streaming services, or just &lt;a href="https://ariandherbanjo.bandcamp.com/album/collected-recordings-from-the-spring-of-2011"&gt;music that’s on Bandcamp but not streaming services&lt;/a&gt;, I still want to have a good way of syncing all of the music I like across devices — and Apple Music does a great job of that. I just drag something into the application formerly known as iTunes, and in a few moments, it shows up on my iPhone, syncs to my iPod, and can even be played through my HomePods. I’d write more about how much I love this one aspect of Apple Music, but honestly, I’m starting to sound like an annoying hipster, even to myself. &lt;em&gt;—Mitchell Clark &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="b2RTbC"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gDKXwj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/etree?tab=about"&gt;Live Music Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Music Archive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ntUAd4"&gt;Did you know you can listen to over 200,000 concerts in lossless audio quality for free? And I really do mean free. The Live Music Archive, part of the Internet Archive, hosts an enormous vault of live performances from &lt;a href="https://archive.org/browse.php?collection=etree&amp;amp;field=creator"&gt;a wide range of artists&lt;/a&gt; who’ve given their blessing to have concerts traded among fans. Yes, there’s a ton of material from the Grateful Dead and jam bands in there, but the LMA also contains hundreds of recordings from acts like the Drive-By Truckers, John Mayer, Elliott Smith, Smashing Pumpkins, and more. Every so often, I’ll start digging through the archive and land on a gem I hadn’t heard before. Most are audience-recorded shows, as commercial releases (understandably) aren’t allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNjO6b"&gt;Now, the Internet Archive isn’t exactly known for intuitive navigation, and the Live Music Archive site can be very kludgy to use. Thankfully, there are apps like &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/archivist/id1180291253"&gt;this one for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.taperssection.taperssectionapp"&gt;this for Android&lt;/a&gt; that serve as easier-to-browse portals for everything inside the Live Music Archive, complete with features like offline downloads. —&lt;em&gt;Chris Welch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple gets its own button on Roku’s latest remotes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Gtyw4JxcT6EHHHzvYex34ZSV1U=/0x0:1322x881/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117927/AppleRoku.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r5JRzh"&gt;In a sign of how far Apple is willing to go to continue raising the profile of Apple TV Plus, the company has worked out a deal with Roku that will give the streaming video service its own shortcut button. This is the first time a branded Apple TV Plus button has appeared on any remote control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uvqn71"&gt;You’ll find it on the new Roku Voice Remote Pro, announced today, which features a rechargeable battery, headphone jack for private listening, and two programmable shortcut buttons. The usual branded buttons include Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, and now Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHW1EG"&gt;The Apple TV Plus button will also be on the remotes that accompany the new Roku Express 4K Plus and Roku Streambar Pro. Those &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have the two customizable buttons, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9ozEdh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Netflix button is an advertisement masquerading as a product ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/24/21232655/netflix-button-tv-remotes-advertisement-marketing-streaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="20vhKQ"&gt;Roku is believed to charge a hefty fee for such prime real estate on its remote controls. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-11/streaming-box-king-roku-is-under-seige-from-amazon-and-apple"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; it basically works out to $1 per customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqqB67"&gt;But Roku has also taken steps in recent months to assuage Apple users: last year, the company added Apple’s AirPlay 2 to its Roku OS software on most 4K-capable streaming products. Now Roku says it will expand that rollout to include HD Roku devices. This makes Roku’s devices a tempting, much less expensive alternative to Apple’s Apple TV hardware, and it’s also a leg up over Amazon Fire TV and Google’s Chromecast, neither of which support AirPlay. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Siri says next Apple event is April 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWBAavh_ooh4qTkAo7hiYd9UWKI=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117300/image__5_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asking Siri, “When is the next Apple Event” generates the following response.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DMxULF"&gt;Siri appears to have spilled the beans on the next Apple launch event. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/siri-apple-event-tuesday-april-20/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; was first to report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;asking the voice assistant “When is the next Apple Event” prompts it to say April 20th. We’ve managed to get the same response, though only on a device that’s associated with a US Apple ID. Apple typically announces its events with invites sent out a week in advance, meaning the news should become official later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDVUxr"&gt;“The special event is on Tuesday, April 20th, at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA. You can get all the details on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FApple.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381336%2Fsiri-apple-event-april-20th-ipad-pro-announcement-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple.com&lt;/a&gt;” says Siri. Tapping the link takes you to the standard &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381336%2Fsiri-apple-event-april-20th-ipad-pro-announcement-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Event landing page&lt;/a&gt;, where the launch isn’t listed. It seems odd that the response claims the event is happening in Cupertino, since this will almost certainly be another of Apple’s pre-recorded online-only events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0DloBJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The special event is on Tuesday, April 20th, at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jPQCrH"&gt;The message itself doesn’t give any hints about what Apple might be planning to announce at the event. However, recent rumors point towards new iPad Pro models, at least. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; new iPad Pros will debut in April. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro will reportedly be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;Apple’s first device with a Mini LED screen&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to offer a high contrast ratio without the risk of burn-in associated with OLED displays. Reports indicate that the new iPad Pros could be in short supply &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;due to production issues&lt;/a&gt; Apple is facing with the Mini LED displays. Other rumored iPad Pro upgrades include new processors with a similar amount of power to the M1 chip found in Apple’s recent MacBooks, better cameras, and USB-C ports with faster transfer speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZniWj"&gt;There are rumors that Apple is also close to launching its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;long-rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt;. The location tracking devices, which should allow users to keep track of items using Apple’s Find My software, were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142249/apple-tags-iphone-kuo-location-tracking"&gt;expected to launch last year&lt;/a&gt; but ultimately never appeared. With Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;recently opening up its Find My network&lt;/a&gt; to track items from third-party companies, the stage is now set for the launch of its own physical trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCdU3B"&gt;Unless Siri is lying, the invitations should arrive imminently.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
