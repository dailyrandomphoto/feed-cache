    <title>Beats announces $149.99 Studio Buds earbuds with active noise cancellation</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mu6IjI"&gt;Beats today announced its second pair of true wireless earbuds, the new Beats Studio Buds.  Priced at $149.99 and available in red, black, or white, the Studio Buds have a much different, more compact design than the previous Powerbeats Pro. There are no ear hooks on these, nor any stems, and that results in a very lightweight, comfortable fit. Preorders start today in the US and Canada from Apple and other retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SSCV5K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbeats-by-dr-dre-beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earphones-beats-red%2F4900921.p%3FskuId%3D4900921&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and the earbuds will be available in stores on June 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7Lt2e"&gt;The Studio Buds include active noise cancellation, IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and can last for up to five hours on a charge. (If you leave noise cancellation off, they can eke out eight hours of continuous playback. They also use USB-C for charging — there’s no wireless charging, unfortunately — and either earbud can be used independently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDwELo9-MOlt2IXkYhsfvqgJWvs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657571/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_10.13.54_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beats&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Studio Buds have a sleek, lightweight design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O8qH2S"&gt;Interestingly, Beats is supporting both iOS and Android features with the Studio Buds. On iPhone, you get the familiar, easy AirPods-like setup and Control Center integration. They can also do hands-free “Hey Siri” commands. On Android, Beats now works with Fast Pair and Google’s Find My Device features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HlBrz"&gt;Beats came up with an all-new acoustic architecture design for the Studio Buds, which have  8.2-millimeter drivers, and the company claims you can expect “outstanding stereo separation and low harmonic distortion across the frequency curve so you hear every note.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loR4Kw"&gt;If you’re wondering how the Studio Buds might stack up to the AirPods Pro or other competitors, I’ve been spending some time testing the just-announced earbuds, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22297011"&gt;read my full review of the Beats Studio Buds here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats Studio Buds review: big ambition, imperfect execution</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Beats tried to do a lot at once — probably too much — with its new earbuds&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YY8TLa"&gt;The new Studio Buds are Beats’ second pair of true wireless earbuds and follow the Powerbeats Pro, which remain my pick for the best all-around earbuds for fitness purposes like running or hitting the gym. With its latest pair, Beats is hoping to attract a much wider audience. That starts with the price, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SSCV5K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $149.99&lt;/a&gt; — a full $100 less than the AirPods Pro. For the first time in Beats earbuds, they include active noise cancellation. And with other new features, Beats is extending an olive branch to Android users, which might come as a surprise for a brand that’s owned by Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSlAkF"&gt;Beats says it has put an incredible amount of work into how the Studio Buds sound. That’s where they’re supposed to exceed expectations for the price. But you don’t get everything under the sun for $150; the most obvious missing piece is wireless charging. And their noise cancellation and transparency modes don’t keep pace with some pricier earbuds, including the AirPods Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="170UiG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10605844"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YCRpFH"&gt;The Studio Buds have a small, light stem-less design that loses the ear hooks of the Powerbeats Pro. They look downright miniature in comparison. And the weight difference is also substantial: each of the Studio Buds is 5.1 grams, which is far more comfortable on your ears than the 20-gram Powerbeats Pro. They’re also slightly lighter than the AirPods Pro, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro, Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro, Jabra’s Elite 85t/75t, and many others on the market. There’s a tiny micro-venting hole meant to reduce that clogged-up pressure feeling in your ear, and Beats includes the standard three sizes of silicone ear tips. Fit is a big plus; the Studio Buds feel extremely comfortable and never fatigued my ears at any point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pxu9b74Hlrtv0mppsw60BH15a4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657483/DSCF4186_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Studio Buds are much smaller than the previous Powerbeats Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BRCiyN"&gt;Beats leaned on learnings from its prior earbuds (and those from Apple) as it worked on this design; it also went through some prototyping with consumers to land on the final form factor. The outward-facing side is contoured around a diagonal pill-shaped “b” button. It’s tactile and actually presses in instead of relying on capacitive touch sensors. I greatly prefer this approach since you won’t have to deal with accidental presses as often when adjusting the earbuds. The button only requires a light press, so you’re not constantly jamming the buds deeper into your ears. Controls work identically on both sides: press once to play / pause, twice to skip tracks, three to go back, and long-press to toggle between ANC on / transparency / off. You can customize the long-press to activate a voice assistant instead, but that’s as far as Beats lets you switch things up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gma9wU"&gt;The oval charging case is mercifully way smaller than the giant one that holds the Powerbeats Pro, and the red color of my review unit is quite eye-catching. There’s also something reassuring about how strongly the Studio Buds are magnetically pulled into their slots. I’m hopeful these will avoid the occasional only-one-earbud-actually-charged failures of the Powerbeats Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGvBfVOHAlKqpDIQbDEl_g4wlUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657689/DSCF4150_Edited_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging case is also much more pocketable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MnIpuA"&gt;I’d say the most curious thing about the Studio Buds hardware is what’s been left out: there’s no Apple-made chip inside these. The Powerbeats Pro, Powerbeats, and even the $50 Beats Flex neckband earbuds all have one of Apple’s branded chips inside — either the H1 or W1 — for features like instant setup, automatic pairing across all Apple devices that are signed in to your iCloud account, and audio sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GV5m4y"&gt;Despite the lack of Apple silicon, Beats has managed to replicate some of those conveniences through software. The Studio Buds support hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands. When you pop open the case near an iPhone for the first time, you’ll see the familiar setup screen (or at least something close) slide up from the bottom, just like with AirPods or other Beats products. The Studio Buds even have special integration in Control Center: you can switch between noise-canceling and transparency modes from here just as you can with the AirPods Pro. They’ll also automatically play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Apple Music’s new Dolby Atmos spatial audio tracks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zc0YdryhvbS2pdaO2u1oOJp3-DI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657522/beatsios.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite having no Apple chip inside, the Studio Buds replicate some AirPods features through software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6SJFtd"&gt;But the illusion only stretches so far. If you go looking for them, you’ll notice MIA features that would’ve been present if the Studio Buds contained a proper Apple chip. Pairing them with your iPhone does&lt;em&gt; not &lt;/em&gt;sync them across your other iCloud devices. Audio sharing is nowhere to be found. And the Studio Buds lack the ability to automatically hop between an iPhone, iPad, and Mac based on whichever one you’re actively using. (They don’t have multipoint either, so losing those seamless handoffs is all the more apparent.) These are minor sacrifices, but they do put the Studio Buds behind Apple’s headphones or even other Beats models in terms of supporting Apple’s ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQGZobYriTob3jes0osz-_O1RaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657477/DSCF4104_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a tactile “b” button on each earbud for controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J_1tGg-5HbFirbYaxZHFLpsu19E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657476/DSCF4102_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case has enough juice for two extra top-offs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fOp5tN"&gt;My hunch is that Beats likely had to leave out Apple silicon in order to include Android-specific features. The Studio Buds go farther than any of the company’s recent products in accommodating Android listeners. First of all, they charge via USB-C. They also support Fast Pair, so they’ll automatically be linked to your Google account after initial setup. Both the earbuds and case now natively appear in Android’s Bluetooth settings, where you can see their battery status or see the location where they were last paired to your phone. (This means the earbuds support both Apple’s Find My network and Google’s equivalent.) But you don’t get hands-free Google Assistant, which was probably a bridge too far for an Apple-owned company to make happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WPqk0BPZKcrl6ez-IRTBqyo1LhU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657533/android.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beats now supports native Android features like Fast Pair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aVfFdp"&gt;Now onto the sound. The Beats Studio Buds feature a new driver architecture, so while the company aimed for its signature “powerful” sound, there’s a noticeable difference when you compare these to the Powerbeats Pro. Each has its own strengths. If you care most about driving bass to keep you motivated during exercise, the older earbuds still edge these out. The Powerbeats Pro sound still comes through as punchier to me. But the Studio Buds are better balanced with increased clarity and separation across the frequency range. Whereas the Powerbeats Pro tend to deemphasize the mids, they’re not as lost in the shuffle here. The EQ has improved refinement, though it’s still the usual curve that lifts the bass and treble, and highs can sometimes give off more sibilance than I’d prefer. Overall, the Studio Buds sound plenty good, but for all of the talk about proprietary acoustic diaphragms and custom-built drivers, Beats isn’t flipping the script on what to expect for this amount of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLQeRO"&gt;And it needs to do better elsewhere. Passive noise isolation on the Studio Buds still leaves something to be desired. Even with a good seal, you’re not going to feel especially blocked off from the outside world. And unfortunately, Beats’ noise cancellation system is one of the weaker showings you’ll find in this price range. Beats says it dynamically adapts the strength of noise cancellation based on ambient noise, but I was underwhelmed in most scenarios where I tested it. The Studio Buds do a poor job at eliminating basic traffic street noise, which makes me wary of how they’d manage on a plane. The transparency mode also lacks the natural feeling of the AirPods Pro and other premium buds like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. You don’t have to spend a hundred dollars more to get better results: to my ears, Amazon’s second-generation Echo Buds surpass the Studio Buds in both noise cancellation and transparency mode for less money than the Beats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="fEy0XW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10605857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPNF3r"&gt;Battery life is rated at around five hours with noise cancellation active or eight without, and the case can provide two additional top-offs. The Studio Buds are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, making them workout-ready and splash-proof. And you can use either earbud independently if you want to keep one of your ears free. Voice call performance was pretty rough outdoors in busy environments, and callers found it difficult to make out my voice from the background noise. Things improved some indoors, but mic performance is another area where the Studio Buds lag competitors and their compact design might be working against them. Another annoyance is that these buds don’t have any kind of sensors to detect when they’ve been removed from your ears, so music won’t pause automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5DdrjvwzwPRaBjnLjoAVMhbH3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657478/DSCF4120_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Studio Buds can last for five hours with noise cancellation on or eight with it off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3gqVMt8RSea7mFrg2fCoodvCL-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657482/DSCF4162_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re also rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NPAK9f"&gt;There are aspects of the Beats Studio Buds that I really like. They’re remarkably comfortable and have simple, easy controls. It’s good that the company is shifting to a more even-handed strategy that appeals to both iPhone and Android users. And the sound is enjoyable and detailed, if not earth-shattering for $150. But they settle for mediocre active noise cancellation, lack wireless charging, and come with an incomplete grab bag of Apple ecosystem bells and whistles. It feels like Beats tried to do a little too much all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t3XExT"&gt;If you already have the Powerbeats Pro and are happy with them, there’s not much about the Studio Buds that warrants an upgrade. Like a lot of rivals battling it out at this price, they’re perfectly adequate, but they lack any one must-have standout thing. Considering the cultural clout that the Beats brand still possesses, that still might be enough for them to be a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon wants you vaccinated, so here’s $180 AirPods Pro and other accessory discounts  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-ZJMAVDO75nkdN07lIyy9_DAPc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448997/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U7IgN6"&gt;Verizon is joining &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/today-the-first-winners-of-washington-states-covid-vaccine-lottery-will-be-chosen/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/media-center/odh-news-releases/odh-news-release-05-28-21"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; in offering a financial incentive to get the COVID vaccine: its customers who have gotten at least one dose can get a 10 percent discount on accessories, from either its online or physical stores. To sweeten the deal even more, Verizon is letting customers stack that discount on top of sale prices, which can be used to get some pretty solid deals. It’s unclear if or how you’ll have to prove your vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKbanD"&gt;For example, Verizon has the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/apple-airpods-pro-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro on sale&lt;/a&gt; until June 20th, and the 10 percent discount brings them down to $180 from their normal price of $250. If you’re more a fan of headphones and can snag the discount, you’ll be able to pick up Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/sony-wireless-noise-canceling-over-the-ear-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;delightfully named WH-1000XM4s&lt;/a&gt; for $270. The offer could also be a way to get a nice little discount on a lower-priced item you’ve been considering, like a Samsung wireless charging pad or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/anker-soundcore-liberty-air-2-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIShJB"&gt;The offer is also valid for first responders, nurses, teachers, and military members. Any customers who are eligible will have from June 15th to July 31st, 2021 to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/discounts/vaccination/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fill out a questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; and receive their promo code, which can be redeemed until August 15th. While accessories that are on sale can be discounted, Verizon says that, for whatever reason, accessories whose prices end with a .97 can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3HiJf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Future Apple Watches could feature blood glucose and body temperature sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O11u__BAkZGSWvl4aWbYjdFqGL4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448696/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6, released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h8ahct"&gt;This year’s Apple Watch could feature an improved screen and updated ultra-wideband support, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, but more substantial improvements like temperature and blood glucose monitoring will not appear until later models. The company is also reportedly planning a successor to last year’s more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a new extreme sports-focused model, due for release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBxl32"&gt;The improvements coming to this year’s model, which will almost certainly be called the Series 7, appear to be small. Its display bezels are said to be thinner, and a new lamination  technique could reduce the distance between the display and the front cover. The watch’s ultra-wideband support could also be improved after getting its Apple wearable debut in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;last year’s Series 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NyDWvI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An extreme sports-focused model may not launch until next year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JTZ00W"&gt;But the years ahead could bring more substantial improvements for Apple’s wearable. Top of the list is a new blood glucose monitoring feature, which could automatically log blood-sugar levels for diabetics without them needing to prick a finger to draw blood. There’s also reportedly a new body temperature monitoring feature on the way, which has reportedly seen a surge in interest due to the pandemic. The temperature sensor could appear in the watch’s 2022 refresh, while blood glucose monitoring is several years away, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyFkFe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22351979/apple-watch-rugged-extreme-sports-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was internally discussing releasing a rugged smartwatch aimed at extreme sports users. It now reports this model, internally referred to as an “explorer” or “adventure” edition, is unlikely to release this year, and could arrive in 2022. However &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;cautions that this, like all of Apple’s unannounced plans, are subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to customize your iPhone’s app icons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOdBcTTheQdzuU1CVztawE8DbsE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69446002/bfarsace_201106_4269_030.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CT8iXi"&gt;Have you ever wanted to make your iPhone your own, with your individualized style and flair? Sure, you can change your home screen wallpaper. But if you really want to personalize your phone, why not create your own app icons? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4hFLk"&gt;It’s doable, using Apple’s built-in Shortcuts app. You actually won’t be replacing the icons that the apps came with — rather, you’ll be creating separate Shortcuts that lead to the app.   It’s a tedious and time-consuming process, but in the end, you can have a fully customized iPhone home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTqHfS"&gt;Here’s how you do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4opbvA"&gt;First, find and tap on the Shortcuts app. It’s pre-installed; if you can’t see it immediately on your home screen, swipe left until you’re at the App Library and start typing “Shortcuts” into the top search bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dA4Adi"&gt;Once you’re in the app, tap on the “plus” sign in the upper-right corner, and then on “Add Action”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shortcut can help you create new bookmarks for your apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmTDxfYPnlWBvy5ksFZwCCeVnMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653452/IMG_9007135DEFEF_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shortcuts can help you create new bookmarks for your apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The plus sign in the opening screen will lead to the New Shortcut page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/36aWAUpH5b8ORalmRTApv3FwoP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653453/IMG_8B871FA6861F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The plus sign in the opening screen will lead to the New Shortcut page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Rl4v05"&gt;There are a lot of interesting things to try out in Shortcuts. But right now, what we want to do is switch app icons. Type “Open app” in the search bar and then tap on the “Open App” link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XCKRrg"&gt;Tap on the word “Choose.” You’ll see a list of your apps; pick the one you want to customize and you’ll be taken back to the New Shortcut page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Type “Open app” in the search bar" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cl_fKOn61f18IdH-awincjKiD9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653455/IMG_37022E4783D2_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Type “Open app” in the search bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on “Choose” to select which icon to replace" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X-I9_LAmRnwQlRO5sEvmwinCkg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653457/IMG_1A089FF8B14A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on “Choose” to select which icon to replace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HzgHOz"&gt;Select the three dots in the upper-right corner. You’re now in the Details page. Give your shortcut a name and tap “Add to Home Screen.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uuIAM1"&gt;You’ll now see a preview of the icon (which will be a standard, uninteresting icon that Shortcuts automatically adds). Don’t worry, we’re going to make it better. Select Add in the top-right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Name your shortcut and tap on “Add to Home Screen”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DvxzULfAgJv8c2t7cL15UgDni-I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653471/IMG_C0782AA4336E_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name your shortcut and tap on “Add to Home Screen.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Add”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpqlPJlBKnT0wSSeVIn8cNh2Rcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653474/IMG_5A5AAD54523D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Add.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4A9Oyt"&gt;Now it’s time to find your substitute icon. There are a bunch of icon sources online (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flaticon.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22529978%2Fapple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Flaticon&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or if you’re artistic and / or ambitious, you can create your own. Whether you use someone else’s or your own, save the image to Photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2SImSe"&gt;Now go back to the Shortcuts preview area. (You can find it again by going to the Details section and tapping on “Add to Home Screen.”) Tap on the icon under “Home Screen Name and Icon.” You’ll have the choice of either taking a photo, choosing a photo, or choosing a file. Assuming you’ve already saved an image in Photo, tap on “Choose Photo” and select the photo you want to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="udyrhq"&gt;On the next screen, a highlighted area will indicate what part of the photo will appear as an icon; you can move the photo around until you’re happy with the section indicated. Tap “Choose” in the lower-right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can create an icon from a new photo, a saved photo, or a file" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVDuCP2oNtlJkjaJJkSN8j_CM7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653487/IMG_8F28F1423B8D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can create an icon from a new photo, a saved photo, or a file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll have to crop your photo to the right dimensions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02fQSnoF4bW2iUtHgdeN-rswHUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653493/IMG_2A665EFE27F3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to crop your photo to the right dimensions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lCKV5y"&gt;Now, you’ll see your new icon. Tap Add.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzDhp6"&gt;You should see your new customized icon on your home screen. Congrats!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SBacWP"&gt;There’s the possibility you may see two new icons on your home screen: one with the first boring icon, and one with your wonderful new icon. If that’s the case, just press and hold the icon that you don’t want, and then select “Delete bookmark.” Remember, this (and the other you created) is a bookmark / shortcut — not the original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Voila! Your new icon is ready" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IqDtwhDt2TrnFN05duszNvUc69w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653500/IMG_0D46D384E161_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voila! Your new icon is ready.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can hide the original icon if you want" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wcXApwlRvi8PzqoYVUXlCHp7iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653502/IMG_141812774F53_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hide the original icon if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uMQx0K"&gt;You can also hide the original app icon so you’ll just have the new one visible. (You don’t want to delete it completely, of course; that would delete the app.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4q02gy"&gt;Long-press on the original app icon and select “Edit Home Screen” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Ppj8h"&gt;Tap on the minus sign. On the pop-up menu, tap “Remove from Home Screen.” The original icon won’t be deleted, just hidden; you can always find it in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vs46q8"&gt;One note: when you use your new icon to go to the app, you will occasionally get a small drop-down notice that tells you what the original app is called and to remind you of the fact that it is a shortcut. But the drop-down will only last for a second or two, so it shouldn’t be much of a bother.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New iPad Pro ad features classic song from The Little Mermaid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Bikg-WGXHKryB29DkniiLYC7cA=/58x0:1248x793/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69444467/Screen_Shot_2021_06_12_at_10.35.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cmtkPo"&gt;Apple’s YouTube page currently has an unlisted video for a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awTP7IUY3uo"&gt;very clever iPad Pro ad&lt;/a&gt; featuring the song “Part of Your World” from Disney’s iconic animated film &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/12/ipad-pro-ad-little-mermaid/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLmP44"&gt;In the ad, PC users sing the lyrics to the classic song while looking upon their (of course) ugly-looking computer setups that are filled with peripherals and wires. (One woman’s leg is literally tied to her chair by a cord.) Often, they forlornly look outside, where people are happily using their iPad Pros to video chat, play games, and do work, seemingly free from the horrible confines of desktop computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBvotj"&gt;The lyrics, admittedly, do apply well for an ad where Apple is trying to prove that an iPad Pro can do everything that a “normal” computer can do without things like a dedicated monitor or a constant power supply. I should note, though, that many of the iPad Pro users in the ad have additional accessories paired with their device such as an Apple Pencil or a Magic Keyboard case. Even in Apple’s own marketing, an iPad Pro on its own sometimes isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8juw8"&gt;Here are all of the lyrics used in the ad, if you want to follow along while you watch. (For the Disney purists, or those that grew up seeing &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt; approximately one thousand times, like I did, you should know that Apple skips chunks of the full song to make the lyrics work better for the ad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0WqhjX"&gt;Look at this stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB7xOv"&gt;Isn’t it neat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Whjop"&gt;Wouldn’t you think my collection’s complete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojdzA8"&gt;Wouldn’t think I’m the girl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYQeXR"&gt;The girl who has everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bC71b6"&gt;Got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nh9cCH"&gt;Got whositz and whatzits galore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69xheR"&gt;You want thingamobs? I’ve got 20!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFv1wG"&gt;But who cares, no big deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ou1Zb4"&gt;I want more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTKSRY"&gt;Up where they walk, up where they run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWBaxF"&gt;Up where they stay all day in the sun &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5o7W2R"&gt;Wandering free, wish I could be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e09Fer"&gt;Part of that world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uYcOqH"&gt;The ad’s appearance follows the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;new iPad Pros in May&lt;/a&gt; that have Apple’s custom-designed M1 processor onboard and, for the 12.9-inch model, a brand new Mini LED display.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple rubberstamped Trump’s request to secretly scoop up data on two members of Congress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wxb5CmJPhMnhWOoqpeb-NdvtPNk=/0x336:4032x3024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69442683/B2E53F34_14F4_4895_AECA_E72D86070E7C.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steve Jobs Theater at Apple’s Apple Park headquarters.&lt;/em&gt; | Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FBbcJ8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/technology/apple-google-leak-investigation-data-requests.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt; on a new wrinkle in the story of how the Trump administration’s Department of Justice used Big Tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528853/trump-force-apple-democrat-house-intelligence-committee-data"&gt;to spy on two members of the House Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to track down leaks to the press — namely, that Apple didn’t fight it, perhaps never had a chance to fight it, because the company rubberstamped the request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rGvdjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Trump administration forced Apple to secretly reveal at least two Democrats’ data","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528853/trump-force-apple-democrat-house-intelligence-committee-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="13T3Uy"&gt;Apple didn’t even know it was handing over the records of Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), then the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, it told the publication. In a statement, Apple said it didn’t know what the investigation was about, and couldn’t have known unless it dug through user accounts itself. So it was handled like the vast majority of the 250 requests the company received from the government each week: approved. “An Apple paralegal complied and provided the information,” reports the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nWJTaa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple did not realize that data on two Democratic lawmakers was part of a request by the Trump Justice Department. It was handled by a paralegal like a routine request.&lt;a href="https://t.co/kS51EUmnCp"&gt;https://t.co/kS51EUmnCp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacknicas/status/1403471132435623936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="myl4ao"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;More details: The grand jury subpoena sought metadata for 109 identifiers, specifically 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses. Apple said it assumes ISPs and other tech companies were also sent similar requests. Apple now limits identifiers to 25 or less.&lt;/p&gt;— Zack Whittaker (@zackwhittaker) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/1403476908789178375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9KULPB"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times’ &lt;/em&gt;piece paints a picture of a US government whose requests have been increasing in volume, and perhaps a general willingness by Big Tech to comply (not that these companies often have a choice). Apple challenged only 4 percent of this sort of request in the first six months of 2020, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. And while Google fought a gag order when the Trump administration seized the phone records of &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;reporters, the story suggests it was easier to challenge because Google counted the NYT as a corporate customer, not an individual user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLMN3L"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/us.html"&gt;Both Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en&amp;amp;user_requests_report_period=series:requests,accounts;authority:US;time:&amp;amp;lu=user_requests_report_period"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have transparency report pages where you can see how many government requests they received, and how often they comply. Apple didn’t reply to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="If2jF8"&gt;Microsoft was also swept up in Trump’s leak hunt. It told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that it, too, only learned that it had provided information to the government about a congressional staff member after a gag order expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzJtqP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPiZb9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple added beautiful 3D details to Maps, but it still can’t get me out of this forest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nl0o8e27XqvpcvCsZpQNU99YuG4=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69441470/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is impressive, but it won’t help me get around town.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wShuUH"&gt;During the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS portion of Apple’s WWDC keynote&lt;/a&gt;, it showed some amazing demos of 3D cities and AR transit directions, but amid all the beautiful features there were a few things missing from the stage and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F11%2F22528793%2Fapple-maps-missing-features-ios-15-aesthetics-functionality" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 feature list&lt;/a&gt;. Namely, some basic navigation tools that would let me get around easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ex1Ol4"&gt;Since Apple seems to be focusing a lot on Maps (it got stage time &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE?t=1190"&gt;at last year’s keynote, too&lt;/a&gt;), perhaps they’re also taking requests? Here’s my wishlist. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ppj4Zoa2G1SbtyIMxLl4cY242jI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653069/IMG_1751.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t forget, you’re here forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Sv4BJw"&gt;Offline Maps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="CJGdyY"&gt;Without a cellular signal or Wi-Fi, Apple Maps turns into a brick — you can’t search for locations, find routes, or do anything useful. This is, to put it lightly, a bit of a problem for a navigation app that’s been around for eight years. Imagine you used Apple Maps to navigate to somewhere that doesn’t have reliable cell service (like, say, many national parks), then want to go home. Apple Maps can get you through a dead zone, but if you’ll be staying a while, you won’t be able to use Apple Maps to get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUwfl5"&gt;While leaving civilization and never coming back may appeal to some people (hello), it’s not the experience most are looking for. There are various ways to solve this — Apple could create a system where Maps caches the places you’ve recently traveled through, making at least basic routing available without an internet connection, or it could go full Google Maps and let you arbitrarily download massive parts of the map that will be available offline. There just needs to be some way to navigate your way out of a cellular dead zone should you find yourself in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zddpp0"&gt;Since Apple Maps will work offline if you’ve got navigation going, maybe there’s a workaround? Could you create a route that brings you to a place, but then also takes you back home? That’s very clever, but no, because Apple Maps doesn’t have... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="zMSdQm"&gt;The ability to create multi-stop routes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="cIIMfP"&gt;The ability to create routes with more than one destination is, admittedly, more useful while you’re planning a trip than while you’re actually traveling, but it can still save you the hassle of having to choose a new destination every time you arrive somewhere. Apple Maps, however, doesn’t have this ability — you can do point-to-point travel, and that’s it. As far as I (and people on &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8502456"&gt;Apple’s forums&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ck4wcg/why_doesnt_apple_maps_support_multiple/"&gt;and Reddit&lt;/a&gt;) can tell, you can’t even do multiple stops in the desktop Apple Maps, which would at least help with planning. Meanwhile, in Google Maps land...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E4srLdrdUKbUmWaH6pv7VEhLgIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652964/IMG_1746.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JkM6vN"&gt;But wait, isn’t there an Add Stop button in Apple Maps? Indeed, there is, but I regret to tell you that it’s not for creating multi-stop routes — it’s for adding a brief detour. And, to add insult to injury, it’s almost useless for what it’s actually designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-riJ2fVYEGKgJ_bzJ3eVcGpwaLk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652951/IMG_1747.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Add Stop button brings nothing but frustration. In my two years using Apple Maps, I’ve never successfully used it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="SlimF6"&gt;The ability to actually choose a stop along your route&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="JyOBYk"&gt;The Add Stop button lets you find a temporary pit stop along your route, so you can take a break from driving to get food, gas, or whatever. The problem is that it’s extremely limited in this capability — it only lets you choose from a few predetermined categories and will only show you a few from each one. It does provide a quick and easy interface for use while driving, but if you want to do something specific, you’ll be in for a rough time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntFXkTLnQeJ5oUz7PLoGLuXrZgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653067/IMG_1752.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tapping on Restaurants (currently labeled “Breakfast” because it’s morning) will give you a list of 10 places that are nearby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c6KcFm"&gt;If you want to stop at a specific restaurant, you can’t search for it using the Add Stop menu. As an example, say I was traveling to Seattle but wanted to stop at a McDonald’s along the way. I’d have to stop my navigation to Seattle and set it to McDonald’s instead. Then, after I was done there, I’d have to set my navigation to Seattle again. With Google Maps, I’d just be able to search along my route, add McDonald’s, and be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4XBxf"&gt;Google Maps’ search along route feature is great for another reason — if I want to stop in, say, 60 miles instead of right now, I could set Google Maps&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to a gas station that’s a ways up the road. Apple Maps can only show what’s around you, not further on along the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="HI06lC"&gt;More obvious bike and footpaths&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="nCayN9"&gt;This one is small, but if you’re trying to visually plan out a route where you’ll be walking or biking, you’ll really have to hunt for paths in Apple Maps. Look at this comparison between a local paved trail in Apple Maps versus what it looks like in Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ls1HNY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10602509"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yFbuKk"&gt;It’s safe to say that the one in Google Maps is just a tad easier to notice and trace. Apple did mention improving details like this in iOS 15, but those improvements seemed to be in the cities that were getting the upgraded 3D maps, not everywhere (though I’d love for that to not be the case). Either way, Apple obviously knows my trail exists, so it’d be great if it could highlight it in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="yq5TwW"&gt;Satellite view in CarPlay&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="GeqW0N"&gt;This is, again, a small one — Apple talked about Maps helping people navigate better while driving, but for the areas that won’t get 3D mapped anytime soon, actually being able to see a satellite view while driving could help improve their navigation experience. Satellite view may not be for everyone all the time, but if you’re navigating a tricky intersection, or a dense area where landmarks may be key, being able to see a top-down picture instead of just an abstracted map could help you avoid missing a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ImK6nR"&gt;
&lt;p id="CxcoPJ"&gt;Of course, there are navigation apps available that have these features — I’ve directly compared Apple Maps with Google Maps several times, and Google also makes Waze. However, while Google Maps and Waze do have CarPlay integration, they’re generally not as well-integrated as Apple Maps is (for obvious reasons). There’s also the matter of privacy — some people, myself included, would rather not give Google all the location data that comes with using their mapping service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJbSe5"&gt;Whatever reason people decide to stick with Apple Maps, they deserve to have a useful navigation experience, and it’d be nice to see Apple getting the basics done before adding an (admittedly lovely looking) moonlight aesthetic to Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>House lawmakers introduce five bipartisan bills to unwind tech monopolies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qFoUOaPpANoVE-soa2qL07Bow5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69441138/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NMGfr4"&gt;On Friday, House Democrats introduced five new bills meant to chip away at the power of big tech companies, targeting a variety of practices that antitrust advocates say are stifling competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZVRWK"&gt;These measures are the House Judiciary Committee’s historic, 16-month long investigation into the business tactics of companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. With this new slate of bills, Congress is getting ready to legislate based on the concerns raised by that investigation — and the move could reshape the tech industry as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bYQVBr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zbQdoB"&gt;“Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy. They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers, destroy small businesses, raise prices on consumers, and put folks out of work,” Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) said in a statement Friday. “Our agenda will level the playing field and ensure the wealthiest, most powerful tech monopolies play by the same rules as the rest of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpFpvp"&gt;The package unveiled Friday includes five measures targeting the different ways in which tech companies maintain market dominance. One bill would empower the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission to break up tech firms by forcing them to sell off parts of their business that could create a conflict of interest — potentially forcing Amazon to carve off house brands like Amazon Basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tenz8K"&gt;Another bill would bar companies from giving their own services preference over their rivals, like Google boosting its own products in search results over competitors. Yet another bill would block companies like Facebook from buying up nascent competitors like in the 2012 acquisition of Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNP5ao"&gt;The last two bills are less controversial. Last week, the Senate already passed a measure put out by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) that would boost merger filing fees for large companies, giving antitrust enforcers more money to take on cases. A bill mirroring that legislation was introduced Wednesday. The last bill would force platforms to make the data they collect interoperable in order to make it easier for users to jump from one service to another. Both Republicans and Democrats seem eager to move forward on data portability legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNGQif"&gt;The House’s tech investigation was a bipartisan endeavor, and while both parties agree on many of the probe’s findings, they disagree on some of the solutions. The probe culminated into an over 400-page report from Democratic staff detailing its findings. Rep. Ken Buck (CO), the committee’s top Republican, issued his own report focusing on the ways large platforms allegedly censor conservative speech and encouraging other Republicans to support competition reform as a means of addressing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaBR2c"&gt;It’s unclear how lawmakers plan to move forward on the legislation, but the multi-pronged approach could make it easier to enact some changes over the coming Term. More measured approaches like Klobuchar’s to boost regulatory funding could find broad support in the House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNhFrU"&gt;At least one Republican and one Democrat signed on to each of Friday’s measures. Still it’s unclear if all members support each bill. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/murdoch-pushes-republicans-support-antitrust-bills-471e7868-4dd3-4b3b-a8af-62cf25582fe7.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that lobbyists for Rupert Murdoch’s media companies, like Fox Corp. and News Corp., were urging House Republicans to support the measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk3sNM"&gt;“These companies have maintained monopoly power in the online marketplace by using a variety of anticompetitive behaviors to stifle competition,” Buck said in a statement Friday. “Doing nothing is not an option, we must act now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple admits why its own Files app was ranked first when users searched for competitor Dropbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GS-K3T8YZ5YQPqrOFrucrnVG1Xk=/0x0:1947x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440655/apple_app_store_wwdc_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdrjqi"&gt;In 2019, facing down extensive investigations &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dominates-app-store-search-results-thwarting-competitors-11563897221?shareToken=st44e68b42ce5f45f5bd573dae5f8f0f5c"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that showed Apple’s App Store clearly and consistently ranking its own apps ahead of competitors, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707323/apple-app-store-apps-favor-own-competitors-search-results-deny"&gt;claimed it had done nothing wrong&lt;/a&gt; — a secret algorithm containing 42 different variables was working as intended, top executives told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, insisting that Apple doesn’t manually alter search results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0Q5kC"&gt;Why do I bring this up? An intriguing email chain has surfaced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; where it sure looks like Apple did the exact opposite — seemingly admitting it manually boosted the ranking of its own Files app ahead of the competition for 11 entire months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z1mj2y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Who green lit putting the Files app above Dropbox in organic search results?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XUC3pE"&gt;“We are removing the manual boost and the search results should be more relevant now,” wrote Apple app search lead Debankur Naskar, after the company was confronted by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney over Apple’s Files app showing up first when searching for Dropbox. “Dropbox wasn’t even visible on the first page [of search results],” Sweeney wrote. You can read the whole email chain embedded a little ways below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0x5c0n"&gt;As you’ll see, Naskar suggested that Files had been &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; boosted for that exact search result during the “last WWDC.” That would have been WWDC 2017, nearly a year earlier, when the Files apps first debuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUbFBh"&gt;The email chain actually reflects fairly well on Apple overall. Apple’s Matt Fischer (VP of the App Store) clearly objects to the idea at first. “[W]ho green lit putting the Files app above Dropbox in organic search results? I didn’t know we did that, and I don’t think we should,” he says. But he does end the conversation with “In the future, I want any similar requests to come to me for review/approval,” suggesting that he’s not entirely ruling out manual overrides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5WMd4u"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20805886-epic-v-apple-internal-email-chain-re-tim-sweeney-and-app-store-search/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Epic v. Apple internal email chain re: Tim Sweeney and App Store search (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="990" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b9z2fE"&gt;But Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that what we think we’re seeing in these emails isn’t quite accurate. While Apple didn’t challenge the idea that Files was unfairly ranked over Dropbox, the company says the reality was a simple mistake: the Files app had a Dropbox integration, so Apple put “Dropbox” into the app’s metadata, and it was automatically ranked higher for “Dropbox” searches as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BE236b"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple manually boosts its first-party apps in search results? Funny, I feel like somebody testified under oath that that never happens &lt;a href="https://t.co/mTgnw8d8CK"&gt;https://t.co/mTgnw8d8CK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1401905981085343749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CLrqtE"&gt;I’m slightly skeptical of that explanation — partially because it doesn’t line up with what Naskar suggests in the email, partially because Apple &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; told me it immediately fixed the error (despite it apparently continuing to exist for 11 months, hardly immediate), and partially because the company repeatedly ignored my questions about whether this has ever happened with other apps before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJqqIF"&gt;The most Apple would tell me is that it didn’t &lt;em&gt;manually&lt;/em&gt; boost Files over competitors, and that “we do not advantage our apps over those of any developer or competitor” as a general rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="220iuT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Best case, Apple didn’t notice it was giving itself an unfair advantage until another CEO pointed it out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CbOYWR"&gt;But honestly, it may not matter whether Apple &lt;em&gt;manually&lt;/em&gt; boosted its own apps or not. What matters is the result: for 11 months, Apple’s new Files app owned exact searches for its competitor Dropbox, a company &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-once-vowed-to-kill-dropbox-now-its-worth-2013-11"&gt;Steve Jobs reportedly swore he would kill off&lt;/a&gt;, and it took the CEO of a prominent Apple partner emailing the company before Apple did something about it. And based on &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s investigation, Apple may not have done much: the Files app still ranked #1 in the App Store for cloud storage in June 2018, a month after this email chain was resolved, according to an infographic that accompanied &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dominates-app-store-search-results-thwarting-competitors-11563897221?shareToken=st44e68b42ce5f45f5bd573dae5f8f0f5c"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJYQuX"&gt;Besides, the distinction between a “manual” boost and any other kind of boost may be purely academic. Algorithms are written by people, after all. If Apple can build a 42-factor algorithm that gives its own apps favorable results, why would it need to override that algorithm and risk its emails getting caught up in a lawsuit years from now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqVtQu"&gt;It could just tweak that algorithm at will — which is exactly what it did to resolve the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s scrutiny two years ago. It only took a single engineer to change the algorithm in July 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple’s own apps immediately fell in App Store rankings. But that time, executives said the previous formula wasn’t a mistake. Apple simply wanted to make it look less like its own apps were getting special treatment. So it “improved” the algorithm to achieve the new result it wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHf6Te"&gt;Apple provided this statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vr2d2K"&gt;We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. App Store Search has only one goal — to get customers what they are looking for. We do that in a way that is fair to all developers and we do not advantage our apps over those of any developer or competitor. Today, developers have many options for distributing their apps and that’s why we work hard to make it easy, fair and a great opportunity for them to develop apps for our customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
