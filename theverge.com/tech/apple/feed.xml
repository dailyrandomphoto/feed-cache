    <title>Estimated ship times for preorders of new MacBook Pro models now into late November, early December</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pn7Z7Arf77btJcEeUQ7rAn-J3ms=/25x0:1936x1274/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70038151/Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_inch_Final_Cut_Pro_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ship times for MacBook Pro models have slid into December&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KMB2mj"&gt;Shipping estimates on the Apple Store for new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro pre-orders have started sliding into late November and early December. As of Sunday morning, estimates for the standard configurations of the 14-inch MacBook Pro were showing delivery dates between November 16th and 23rd. Customizing a 14-inch Pro could push the estimated delivery into mid-December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NDwe3"&gt;For the 16-inch MacBook Pro, standard configurations are showing estimated shipping times between November 23rd and December 1st, with customized options also showing mid-December ship dates depending what you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCKQdWaWZ27b0qLunkAKIbQf1NU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22951561/Screen_Shot_2021_10_24_at_9.01.03_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Apple Online Store showing estimated shipping dates for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro as of October 24th.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h-shipping-times-for-new-orders-continue-to-slip"&gt;Apple introduced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; MacBook Pro laptops at its “Unleashed” event on October 18th. The new design eliminates the Touch Bar in favor of a full-sized function row. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734676/apple-macbook-pro-notch-botch-face-id-missing-feature-design"&gt;added a notch&lt;/a&gt; to MacBook Pro screens for the first time, and brought back more port options, including an HDMI port, three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card slot, and a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="66KnO4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s ‘Unleashed’ Fall 2021 Mac Event: rumors, news, and announcements ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22725300/apple-event-unleashed-fall-2021-mac-mini-macbook-pro-news-announcements-products"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pCUuDh"&gt;We also get the return of the MagSafe charger with the new MacBook Pros, with Apple promising charging up to 50 percent within 30 minutes. The new laptops will also have Apple’s adaptive refresh rate technology ProMotion, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733122/apple-macbook-pro-mini-led-display-120hz-promotion-refresh-rates"&gt;Mini-LED&lt;/a&gt; 120Hz refresh displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9rVOk"&gt;The 14-inch model starts at $1,999, and the 16-inch model starts at $2,499. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4AaEZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Apple’s Mini LED MacBook Pros avoid the iPad Pro’s downsides?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8DNKAxG7r1CcuvHcMmvs48x_mw=/0x101:1496x1098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035215/0930B0A7_5370_4E42_AD2D_52450E957E8A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="plMltY"&gt;When Apple announced the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Mini LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, I knew it was time to upgrade from my 2018 model. And I wasn’t disappointed. The improved brightness (especially when watching movies in HDR) and superior contrast have made the purchase worthwhile — even if iPadOS continues to underwhelm and disappoint in other ways. It’s a wonderful screen that makes me want to use the iPad wherever I can instead of my laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWtUtt"&gt;As a refresher of what Mini LED is, there are thousands of tiny LEDs behind the display — much smaller than those in conventional TVs or LCD displays — that allow for more precise backlighting. In turn, this leads to deeper black levels and all of the other benefits mentioned above. Apple’s iPads and MacBook already had excellent displays with accurate, wide color reproduction. But Mini LED takes their display quality to the next level. Add a smoother 120Hz refresh rate on top of that, plus all those glorious ports, and you can see why people are excited and these machines are already heavily backordered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OuBhmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple finally listened to the pros","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tlPE7v"&gt;But at least with the iPad Pro, this transition to Mini LED didn’t come without any downsides. And with the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros now adopting the same Pro Display XDR (Mini LED) technology, it’s worth tracking whether those same downsides have come along to Apple’s laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FzCI0"&gt;Dieter addressed one of the issues, blooming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt;. Particularly if you’re using the iPad Pro in a dark room, you’ll sometimes notice a halo of light around bright objects on screen when they’re surrounded by a black background. This is a tradeoff that’s inherent to full-array local dimming, and while it bothers some people, I’ve rarely found it annoying in my time using the iPad Pro. Either way, I think it’s occasionally worth dealing with for the  other gains you get in brightness and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjCQqB"&gt;Still, blooming might prove more frustrating on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733173/macbook-pro-specced-out-high-end-price"&gt;a fully-loaded $6,000 laptop&lt;/a&gt; designed for professional editing work. I’m curious to see whether Apple has made any adjustments to diminish the issue on its new MacBook Pros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YK11u"&gt;The other downside of Apple’s Mini LED iPad Pro display is shadowing. As the new iPad made its way to buyers, people noticed &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252801469"&gt;a light shadow&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2021-12-9-screen-shadow.2297031/"&gt;runs along the very edges&lt;/a&gt; of the display. This shadow isn’t one of those things that’s present on some iPads and not others: it’s visible on every single M1 12.9-inch iPad Pro, because it has to do with how the Mini LED system is designed. Whereas most of the panel has superb uniformity, it falls off at the edges where the dimming zones trail off. Like blooming, this is something I don’t personally pay much attention to: my eyes are usually focused closer to the middle of the screen, where everything looks great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vklu2p"&gt;These edge shadows can also be seen on Apple’s premium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161487/apple-mac-pro-display-xdr-review-6k-lcd-screen-price-features"&gt;Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt; monitor. Overcast developer Marco Arment has described them as “the really big downside” of the display. Again, this is something that might be a bigger irritation on an expensive, marketed-at-pros laptop. Perhaps Apple has found a way to run the backlighting a little further beyond the bezels to avoid such an obvious falloff in brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgQ62r"&gt;The positives of the new MacBook Pro screens should easily outweigh the cons. They’re brighter and sharper than ever with the same eye-searing HDR highlights as the iPad Pro. But if you’re a sticker for the small things, it might be worth waiting until reviews are out to see if Apple has made improvements to its still-new display tech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest sci-fi drama Invasion starts out too dang slow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PQtrqlpNNUdjBoiPqyrrDQIFMS8=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70031940/Invasion_Photo_010202.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0cD52c"&gt;For a show about an alien invasion,&lt;em&gt; Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is decidedly lacking in aliens thus far. The latest sci-fi drama on Apple TV Plus, the series debuts with three episodes, which, theoretically, should give viewers a good sense of what to expect. Instead, those episodes oh-so-slowly introduce you to characters and stories without giving much of a hint as to how it all connects aside from the teaseist of teases. Three hours in, and I’m still not even sure what it’s about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYfhd0"&gt;The big hook of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is that it’s a global story. The idea is that you’ll be able to see the impact of this event from a bunch of different perspectives, and at the very least, it succeeds at that (albeit with the expected American-centric viewpoint). Over the first few episodes, you’re introduced to a sheriff in Oklahoma, a housewife in Long Island, a US soldier stationed in Afghanistan, a teen in London, and an expert in Tokyo working with the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4v9II"&gt;And the show’s creators &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want you to know each of these individuals. The first three episodes are spent almost entirely on setting up their lives and circumstances. You’ll see a marriage slowly unravel (with some help from Find My iPhone, in one of the more obvious bits of product placement on Apple TV Plus) and watch a boy’s struggles with an almost pathological bully at school. I was particularly drawn into a secretive relationship between two women at the Japanese space agency that’s tragically cut short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bULNKY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2xFrbVNx0U?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R2oUYZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ratio of human drama and sci-fi storytelling is completely out of whack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LBsGJ"&gt;Many of these stories are interesting, even if they often delve into cliche; the sheriff, of course, is one day away from retirement before the invasion starts to happen. The problem is that the ratio of human drama and sci-fi storytelling is completely out of whack. Across the first three hours, there are only hints of alien elements. There’s the usual like crop circles and fleeing animals, as well as some more unsettling moments like when an entire music class simultaneously gets a nosebleed. Eventually, things start crashing into the planet, causing havoc while TV news reports blame it on terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7X1WI"&gt;I’m all for a slow burn, but after three episodes, I should have some clearer sense of the titular&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;invasion. (Apple’s other big sci-fi drama, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, is similarly slow, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;but at least it’s pretty to look at&lt;/a&gt;.) Here the pacing feels like it's stopping this invasion dead in its tracks. It's great meeting the characters and having a strong sense of their lives before aliens blow it up, but I am also here to see actual aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOc8VT"&gt;It’s entirely plausible that things pick up soon, and the sci-fi elements are actually interesting. We still have seven episodes to go. (New episodes will release every Friday, like most series on Apple.) But early on, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; demands far too much of viewers, expecting them to stick around without giving much assurance of an eventual payoff. Please, just show me an alien already.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to customize your iPhone’s app icons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOdBcTTheQdzuU1CVztawE8DbsE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69446002/bfarsace_201106_4269_030.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CT8iXi"&gt;Have you ever wanted to make your iPhone your own, with your individualized style and flair? Sure, you can change your home screen wallpaper. But if you really want to personalize your phone, why not create your own app icons? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4hFLk"&gt;It’s doable, using Apple’s built-in Shortcuts app. You actually won’t be replacing the icons that the apps came with — rather, you’ll be creating separate shortcuts that lead to the app.   It’s a tedious and time-consuming process, but in the end, you can have a fully customized iPhone home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTqHfS"&gt;Here’s how you do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4A9Oyt"&gt;Before you begin, it’s a good idea to find an icon for your new shortcut. There are a bunch of icon sources online (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flaticon.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22529978%2Fapple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Flaticon&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or if you’re artistic and / or ambitious, you can create your own. Whether you use someone else’s or your own, save the image to Photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4opbvA"&gt;Okay, let’s begin. Find and tap on the Shortcuts app. It’s pre-installed; if you can’t see it immediately on your home screen, swipe left until you’re at the App Library and start typing “Shortcuts” into the top search bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dA4Adi"&gt;Once you’re in the app, tap on the “plus” sign in the upper-right corner. Type the name of your new shortcut on top, and then tap on “Add Action”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shortcut can help you create new bookmarks for your apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmTDxfYPnlWBvy5ksFZwCCeVnMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653452/IMG_9007135DEFEF_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shortcuts can help you create new bookmarks for your apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After you select the plus sign to start a new shortcut, tap on Add Action." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uEijEWhSAHyFqJ9T5oqG4WvJ3vY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945508/IMG_D954C140D41F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After you select the plus sign to start a new shortcut, tap on Add Action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Rl4v05"&gt;There are a lot of interesting things to try out in Shortcuts. But right now, what we want to do is switch app icons. Type “Open app” in the search bar and then tap on the “Open App” link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XCKRrg"&gt;Tap on the word “App” that appears (rather faintly) next to the word “Open.” You’ll see a list of your apps; pick the one you want to customize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zwuizA"&gt;Now, tap the blue symbol in the upper right corner. You’ll be taken back to your shortcut page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Type “Open app” in the search bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gevNxwMcl4ZoUkKfC_1rXQF0M9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945593/IMG_4F75405CF491_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Type “Open app” in the search bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap “App” to select which icon to replace." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0yQJPUJfMIHPa974FkTA-jIKOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945595/IMG_22637E24C8DD_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap “App” to select which icon to replace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HzgHOz"&gt;Tap “Add to Home Screen.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uuIAM1"&gt;You’ll now see a preview of the icon (which will be a standard, uninteresting icon that Shortcuts automatically adds). Don’t worry — we’re going to make it better. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Name your shortcut and tap on “Add to Home Screen.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y4diHVaFAan70_wVunFyFKyt1bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945896/IMG_5A159D409582_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name your shortcut and tap on “Add to Home Screen.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="At first, you get a generic icon." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpqlPJlBKnT0wSSeVIn8cNh2Rcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653474/IMG_5A5AAD54523D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Add.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qb7nmD"&gt;Tap on the icon under “Home Screen Name and Icon.” You’ll have the choice of either taking a photo, choosing a photo, or choosing a file. Assuming you’ve already saved an image in Photo, tap on “Choose Photo” and select the photo you want to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="udyrhq"&gt;If you’ve chosen an existing photo, a highlighted area will indicate what part of the photo will appear as an icon; you can move the photo around until you’re happy with the section indicated. Tap “Choose” in the lower-right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can create an icon from a new photo, a saved photo, or a file" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVDuCP2oNtlJkjaJJkSN8j_CM7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653487/IMG_8F28F1423B8D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can create an icon from a new photo, a saved photo, or a file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll have to crop your photo to the right dimensions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02fQSnoF4bW2iUtHgdeN-rswHUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653493/IMG_2A665EFE27F3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to crop your photo to the right dimensions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lCKV5y"&gt;Now, you’ll see your new icon. If you haven’t added a name for your new shortcut, you can still do it here by typing the name next to the icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uK6ETB"&gt;All ready? Tap Add in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzDhp6"&gt;You should see your new customized icon on your home screen. Congrats!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SBacWP"&gt;There’s the possibility you may see two new icons on your home screen: one with the first boring icon and one with your wonderful new icon. If that’s the case, just press and hold the icon that you don’t want, and then select “Delete bookmark.” Remember, this (and the other you created) is a bookmark / shortcut — not the original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Voila! Your new icon is ready" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IqDtwhDt2TrnFN05duszNvUc69w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653500/IMG_0D46D384E161_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voila! Your new icon is ready.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can hide the original icon if you want" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wcXApwlRvi8PzqoYVUXlCHp7iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653502/IMG_141812774F53_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hide the original icon if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uMQx0K"&gt;You can also hide the original app icon so you’ll just have the new one visible. (You don’t want to delete it completely, of course; that would delete the app.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4q02gy"&gt;Long-press on the original app icon and select “Edit Home Screen.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Ppj8h"&gt;Tap on the minus sign. On the pop-up menu, tap “Remove from Home Screen.” The original icon won’t be deleted, just hidden; you can always find it in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vs46q8"&gt;One note: when you use your new icon to go to the app, you will occasionally get a small drop-down notice that tells you what the original app is called and to remind you of the fact that it is a shortcut. But the drop-down will only last for a second or two, so it shouldn’t be much of a bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTLWzA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 22nd, 2021, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on Jun 13th, 2021; it has been updated to accommodate changes in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 Max MacBook Pro is getting a virtual turbo button for High Power Mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krArQY3jBfR0B6ySC0B94G31n3w=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029214/lcimg_2d0f1c7f_4824_4e90_b501_7d917bcd4ae2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NUm69G"&gt;Apple wants you to think of its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"&gt;M1 Max MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; as a beast of a machine — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tobL8U7dQo"&gt;it actually calls it a “beast” in the ad&lt;/a&gt; — but the upcoming macOS Monterey, which ships alongside the new Macs, will unleash its full potential. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;contributor Steve Moser discovered a new “High Power Mode” in the operating system’s recent beta release that can “optimize performance to better support resource intensive tasks,” and apparently, spin up the fan to compensate for that. Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; that the mode is legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="828eeI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Found more information on the high power power mode in the macOS RC: “Your Mac will optimize performance to better support resource-intensive tasks. This may result in louder fan noise.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/4q3zlbyLnf"&gt;https://t.co/4q3zlbyLnf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0mKVekGa0M"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0mKVekGa0M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1450272709787766793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cWiJkc"&gt;Remember when some powerful laptops came with a physical turbo button or slider? Sounds like Apple does! (Though you can certainly emulate this sort of thing by playing with power modes and fan curves on many Windows machines as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRrP1S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports the new feature is exclusive to the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max, even though it’s possible to configure a 14-inch MacBook Pro with that chip as well. It also apparently won’t work with the M1 Pro or original M1 models, so you’re looking at laptops with a starting price of $3,099 and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AReM2A"&gt;It’ll be interesting to see whether this High Power Mode unlocks additional performance, or whether it’s actually required to see the kinds of results the company claimed on stage for prolonged periods of time. Apple’s had occasional issues with thermal throttling in the past, such as in 2018 when a Core i9 MacBook Pros wound up slower than the Core i7 version under sustained loads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17605652/macbook-pro-thermal-throttling-apple-software-fix"&gt;though Apple said that particular issue was down to a bug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17611266/apple-macbook-pro-review-2018-core-i9-15-inch"&gt;fixed it with an update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b336qd"&gt;Apple’s paying a lot of attention to thermals these days. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt;The single biggest difference between the 2020 M1 MacBook Air and 2020 M1 MacBook Pro was a fan&lt;/a&gt;, and it was a meaningful difference, because the extra thermal headroom meant the Pro could sustain peak performance for longer. That’s why I’m not surprised this high power mode is exclusive to the 16-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zJfnKk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple is ready to admit it was wrong about the future of laptops","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future"},{"title":"Apple finally listened to the pros","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"},{"title":"Apple added a secret button to your iPhone, and you may not have even noticed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21540028/apple-iphone-ios-14-back-tap-hidden-secret-button-gesture"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="N1DAbm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 22nd, 12:19AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that MacRumors has confirmed with Apple that this mode is real.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit took a peek underneath the Apple Watch Series 7’s larger display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 7 teardown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQtiqu6CTaHpkru5HduODV1SUKA=/0x245:5843x4140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029041/Apple_Watch_S7_21_guide_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 teardown | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/53688/three-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYGSz2"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;our review of the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Dieter Bohn called it the best smartwatch while noting the new model’s changes as “smaller iterations” year-over-year than we previously expected. Even those small improvements required some reengineering. To appreciate those efforts, the folks from&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F53688%2Fthree-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F21%2F22738876%2Fapple-watch-series-7-teardown-ifixit-diagnostic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; iFixit teamed up with former Apple engineers to investigate the new parts&lt;/a&gt; and get some insight into how the changes came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fJoxT4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2lD2llGLJzk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmSg7r"&gt;Ex-Apple product designer Tobias is now with &lt;a href="https://instrumental.com/about?utm_medium=Network&amp;amp;utm_source=Partner%20Referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Content&amp;amp;utm_group=ifixit&amp;amp;utm_subgroup="&gt;Instrumental&lt;/a&gt;. He points out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lD2llGLJzk"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt; that by looking at the back of the display, we can see that for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Apple removed a ribbon cable, combining touch and display signals into one cable instead of two. That helped shrink the device’s bezels, but Tobias says in a video that he’s “fairly certain” the complexity of that change and how it rippled through the supply chain is the reason why this Watch was slightly delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYGtzD"&gt;A more surprising moment is when they found out that the Apple Watch Series 6 battery fits in, and works with, the newer model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDSNXT"&gt;Of course, another element of the teardown is what’s not inside the new Apple Watch — an old diagnostic port. Since the earliest versions, it had been hiding inside the watch’s wristband groove, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690061/apple-watch-series-7-wireless-dock-data-transfer-port-free"&gt;now Apple has replaced it with wireless technology&lt;/a&gt;. Is this a hint at an iPhone without ports? We can’t tell yet, but the teardown will show you how everything came together to make the device less susceptible to cracking, better at resisting dust and water, and just that tiny bit better than the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rare Apple VideoPad prototype scrapped by Steve Jobs set to be auctioned</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An open Apple VideoPad in front of a blank background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_b6YXjP-hLqffBgOqs-LLAImHY=/0x63:960x703/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028461/AppleVideoPad.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple VideoPad 2 | Photo: Bonhams&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dv50OY"&gt;The long-lost Apple VideoPad 2 prototype is &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/55/"&gt;going up for auction in November&lt;/a&gt; as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/"&gt;History of Science and Technology auction&lt;/a&gt; by Bonhams, an international auction house, in Los Angeles. The VideoPad will be auctioned alongside other Apple prototypes and Steve Jobs memorabilia and is estimated to sell between $8,000 and $12,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2lwN2"&gt;Developed between 1993 and 1995 with VideoPad 1 and 3 (the only two examples shown to the public), this only surviving PDA prototype was Apple’s next attempt after the Newton Message Pad. Unlike the Newton Message Pad, the fold-up screen apparently included a built-in camera for video conferencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNNu9o"&gt;Despite being designed to be ahead of its time, it was canceled along with Newton OS after Jobs’ return to the company in 1997. &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/55/"&gt;According to Bonhams&lt;/a&gt;, that was after Jobs realized the technology was not yet at the level required for a positive user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J09er5"&gt;The device was produced from conceptual design sketches drawn by former CEO John Sculley. The design never made it to the public, but it was a super early vision for a tablet, and if you squint, you can see a line drawn between it and successful devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083369/apple-ipad-10-years-launch-steve-jobs-tablet-market"&gt;the iPhone and iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mythic Quest has been renewed for a third and fourth season on Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZesWIdHd6kd8wvk5PDQMwHjrSGw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027359/Apple_TV_Mythic_Quest_key_art.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6LIYC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/10/apple-tv-doubles-down-on-mythic-quest-renewing-acclaimed-workplace-comedy-for-seasons-three-and-four/"&gt;renewed for a third and fourth season&lt;/a&gt; on Apple TV Plus, Apple announced today, marking the biggest commitment yet to one of its streaming originals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HkIjX"&gt;The show stars Rob McElhenney (who co-created the series) as Ian Grimm, the ambitious and self-centered creative director of a popular fictional video game, along with Charlotte Nicdao as Poppy Li, the lead engineer and co-creative director who works — and often fights — with Grimm over the direction of the titular &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; game. The show’s ensemble cast also features Murray Abraham, Danny Pudi, Imani Hakim, Ashly Burch, Jessie Ennis, and David Hornsby as members of the game’s development, creative, and testing teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MAJnul"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BREAKING: Big announcement from Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jason Sudeikis (and Ron something) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MythicQuest?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MythicQuest&lt;/a&gt; is returning for Seasons 3 &amp;amp; 4 &lt;a href="https://t.co/OugCaIWwjv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OugCaIWwjv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Apple TV (@AppleTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV/status/1451243133031915521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gd876H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;’s first season debuted on Apple TV Plus in February 2020, but Apple had already ordered the second season before the show even aired. Since then, the series has become one of Apple TV Plus’ biggest hits and, with today’s announcement, will be the first Apple-created show to be ordered for a fourth season so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aR1o4A"&gt;Apple’s announcement didn’t put an exact timing for &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;’s third season beyond a “2022” date, although the company did note that it would arrive “before Ted Lasso season three.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Regulators demand more info about tech payment systems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A closeup photograph of an Indian man in a blue business suit, his collar just barely visible." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nbuFJSPfh4dFr0Y16Bx3iLapxDU=/0x0:4951x3301/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026521/1176565198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CFBP Director Rohit Chopra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mx18fp"&gt;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has issued a series of information-gathering orders on the business practices of major digital payments systems. Orders were issued to Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, PayPal, and Square, the bureau said in an announcement on Thursday morning. Chinese pay systems operated by WeChat and AliPay will also be studied but are not subject to any CFBP orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofUkWp"&gt;Issued as part of the CFPB’s investigative authority, the orders are not an indication of specific wrongdoing, but they suggest the CFPB will be taking a more active role in regulating tech companies’ consumer products in the future. In particular, they are meant to root out any data collection or anti-competitive conduct that may have not yet come to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1J1or"&gt;The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ce2B1j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Will the payment platforms be truly neutral?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c89uVx"&gt;In a statement, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra framed the orders as an effort to ensure tech companies were not using the power of payment processing to exploit consumers or gain an anti-competitive advantage over smaller firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBI2sR"&gt;“Little is known publicly about how Big Tech companies will exploit their payments platforms,” Chopra said in a statement announcing the queries. “For example, will the operators engage in invasive financial surveillance and combine the data they collect on consumers with their geolocation and browsing data?... Will the payment platforms be truly neutral, or will they use their scale to extract rents from market participants?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMPpDf"&gt;Previously an FTC commissioner, Chopra worked closely with current FTC Chair Lina Khan, and the new investigation is meant to harmonize with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690176/ftc-chair-lina-khan-focus-antitrust-consumer-amazon"&gt;the FTC’s ongoing tech antitrust efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwtBNl"&gt;The orders are already drawing applause from antitrust advocates, including the American Economic Liberties project. “The CFPB’s orders will force Big Tech to come clean on their surveillance, data collection, and payments systems,” the group said in a statement, “and provide regulators another important window in their sprawling empires.”&lt;/p&gt;
