    <title>Apple delays full office reopening and is giving every employee a $1,000 bonus</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsOlSF"&gt;Apple has indefinitely delayed the date on which corporate employees will have to return to the office, according to a letter that CEO Tim Cook sent to staff on Wednesday. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said the company’s date for returning to work, was “yet to be determined,” and he encouraged all employees to get the coronavirus vaccine and booster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HLBgb"&gt;“Our offices remain open and many of our colleagues are coming in regularly, including our teams in Greater China and elsewhere,” Cook wrote. “As we look forward to more of our teams being together again, we will continue to make decisions based on local conditions and will be sure to notify you at least four weeks before beginning the pilot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awDSvn"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1471237100255252484"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1471236946160619524"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News’&lt;/em&gt; Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKPsQi"&gt;Cook also announced Wednesday that Apple would be giving all employees $1,000. “These funds are intended to help you with your home workspace and can be used as you see fit,” Cook wrote. Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy confirmed the $1,000 bonus to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and says it will apply to every Apple employee, including retail workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgiBNs"&gt;An internal message to Apple employees said the $1,000 would appear in their next paychecks, and be subject to tax and withholding. “Keep in mind that when you return to the office, you’ll be bringing your Apple-owned equipment back, so you should consider what you’ll want for your home workspace,” the message reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YjAOP"&gt;The delay comes as COVID-19 cases rise and the omicron variant begins to spread. Workers were previously set to return to offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; in a hybrid work pilot announced internally in November. That itself was already delayed, and it’s not the first time Apple has announced such a delay; the company has shifted its pandemic-related return-to-office plans in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfoFF4"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838172/apple-stores-close-retail-covid-19-cases-infections"&gt;closed three retail stores&lt;/a&gt; this week in response to growing COVID-19 infections. On Tuesday, it began requiring customers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;wear masks&lt;/a&gt; while inside its retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y94C8m"&gt;Cook told workers in the letter that he was “grateful” for their flexibility and resilience. “You continue to prove how much we can accomplish when we take on our challenges with boldness, creativity and — most importantly — together.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpPMjd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 10:54 AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds details from Cook’s letter to employees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest AirPods are currently cheaper than they were on Black Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-II7Ukqd8GJx6lHJo0VIACbTo5I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281083/akrales_190327_3315_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s second-gen AirPods are just $89.99 right now at Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EQuJMI"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are always a popular gift, but they can be expensive, regardless of which model you opt for. Thankfully, you can currently nab the entry-level model for less than $100, making them a great present for friends and family if you don’t mind waiting until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcMZA1"&gt;Right now, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling Apple’s second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; with delayed shipping for $89.99, matching their lowest price to date. It’s also less than what we saw them for on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when they were selling for around $110. The last-gen earbuds may be older and lack the wireless charging case found on the more expensive configuration, but they still offer great wireless performance, reliable battery life, and excellent ease of use, making them a terrific pick for Apple users shopping on a budget. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="e8OiQT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the shipping deadlines to get your holiday gifts there on time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22833986/ups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021"},{"title":"Which AirPods model should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oQz2aL"&gt;Of course, if you prefer the newer third-gen buds, which offer IPX4 water resistance and MagSafe charging compatibility, they’ve also plunged to their lowest price to date. Normally $179, Apple’s third-gen AirPods are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Amazon for $139.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is the price we saw them going for on Black Friday. Just keep in mind that they may not ship until after Christmas, meaning they’d likely make for a belated gift. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ND6NaP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="mEO1Uv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10887582"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XxOP0O"&gt;Speaking of all-time lows, if you’re on the hunt for a great, lightweight laptop that’s under $1,000, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-Touch-Screen-Ryzen/dp/B08YWX4W7G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; at its lowest price ever. Regularly $999.99, right now you can pick up the 13.5-inch configuration for $877.79, a $122 discount. To get this deal, you need to select the model that comes with a 256GB SSD, an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;6-core CPU, and 8GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRSXAE"&gt;Note this is the smaller, less powerful version of the 15-inch model that comes with the Ryzen 7 4980U chip we tested, which we praised for its excellent battery life and performance. Nonetheless, it’s still a good laptop with a mid-tier processor that’s fine for streaming shows, using social media, and carrying out other everyday tasks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iQHmdq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LnLzf"&gt;Shifting away from laptops to e-readers, Amazon’s kid-friendly Kindle Paperwhite makes for a great holiday gift both children and parents will love. It’s a fun way to get a child into reading that’s ad-free and comes with parental controls, and right now it’s selling at its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7dvdL"&gt;Typically $159.99, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling the new Kindle Paperwhite Kids&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a bigger display and a USB-C port, for $119.99 in all colorways and designs. That’s just $5 more than the price we saw on Black Friday. The waterproof e-reader, released only a few months ago, also comes with a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, which provides access to thousands of kid-friendly books as well as hundreds of Audible audiobooks. Amazon is also throwing in a two-year warranty, so if it breaks, you can return it and the company will replace it for free. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full 2021 Kindle Paperwhite review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="saCmT0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="05Un3F"&gt;As we get closer to the holidays, several retailers are selling discounted gaming-related gift cards that can come in handy whether you’re looking for a present or you just want to save some money. Now through December 17th, Costco members can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/nintendo-eshop-%2450-digital-card.product.100431276.html"&gt;$50 digital Nintendo eShop gift card for $39.99&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-%24100-gift-card-digital-download.product.100524149.html"&gt;$100 digital Xbox gift card for $79.99&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which can be applied toward both current and next-gen titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YbomSw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926235"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kt5FXu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10506009"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rALVbI"&gt;If you’re on the hunt for budget-friendly gifts you can still get before the holidays, today’s discount on the new Roku Express 4K Plus may be worth a look. Typically $39.99, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Express-Streaming-Wireless-Controls/dp/B0916TKFF2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;streaming stick is going for $24 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is an all-time low and $5 less than the Black Friday price. In comparison to its predecessor, the Roku Premiere, the entry-level 4K streamer comes with a faster processor and increased internal storage. It also offers support for HDR10 Plus and AirPlay 2, while sporting features like dual-band Wi-Fi and the ability to attach a Micro-USB-to-ethernet adapter if you’d prefer a wired connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hzamnT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925733"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pxIi1v"&gt;Some other great deals worth checking out&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Ted Lasso gets a cute claymation holiday short</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeiJTVfbFLjvpnIAieWa-E0lRk0=/76x0:904x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279055/121521_Ted_Lasso_Animated_Holiday_Short_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOMZTH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22590155/ted-lasso-apple-tv-plus-season-2-review"&gt;Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ended on something of a dark note, but everything is all nice and friendly again in a new holiday short. It’s called “The Missing Christmas Mustache,” and, like many classic holiday specials, it’s rendered in cute and charming claymation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgBvsf"&gt;It features voices of the main cast — including Jason Sudeikis, Hannah Waddingham, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/9/1/22652236/ted-lasso-roy-kent-cgi-conspiracy-theory"&gt;definitely-not-CGI Brett Goldstein&lt;/a&gt; — as they search for a missing mustache. It’s only four minutes long, so I won’t spoil too much, only to say you should at least watch to learn a little more about Roy Kent’s eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myJnzA"&gt;If nothing else, it makes up for the poorly-timed Christmas episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; that aired in August — and threw my sense of time and date even further out of whack. And it’s a nice little taste of the show’s wholesomeness while we all wait for season 3 to come to Apple TV Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple closes three more retail stores as COVID-19 infections rise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t79lnqUGVPOcFLxZr7K3KmONZxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278293/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sG1QiA"&gt;Apple has closed three of its retail stores following increased COVID-19 exposures and cases among employees, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/apple-temporarily-shuts-three-retail-stores-after-covid-19-surge"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjqhNE"&gt;The stores, which are located in the Brickell City Centre in Miami; Annapolis, Maryland; and downtown Ottawa, Ontario, will be closed temporarily. Right now, Apple’s website says the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/brickellcitycentre/"&gt;Miami store&lt;/a&gt; is closed until Friday and the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/annapolis/"&gt;Annapolis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/rideau/"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; stores are closed until Saturday. Apple reportedly closed a store in Southlake, Texas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; due to a COVID-19 outbreak, though the company’s website currently indicates &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/southlaketownsquare/"&gt;that store is open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtBXPn"&gt;The closures are happening as COVID-19 infections are on the rise. Though the omicron variant is beginning to spread, the delta variant “continues to be the main variant circulating in the United States,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, Apple once again began requiring customers to wear masks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;inside its US retail stores&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UdCj7"&gt;“We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures to support the wellbeing of customers and employees,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We remain committed to a comprehensive approach for our teams that combines regular testing with daily health checks, employee and customer masking, deep cleaning and paid sick leave.” Employees at the closed stores will have to be tested prior to reopening, the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwc7rS"&gt;Apple has also reportedly pushed back its plans to return its corporate workers to the office. Its latest plan was to have employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;come back on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; under a hybrid work model, but that plan has been delayed to a “yet to be determined” date, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1471236946160619524"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;’ Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. An email from Tim Cook announced that employees would get $1,000 to spend on their home office, Schiffer reported. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/apple-delays-return-to-office-until-date-yet-to-be-determined?srnd=premium&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, retail employees will also receive this bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6m6ul"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 5:14PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Apple delaying its return to the office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ltw8Az"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 7:11PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about retail employees receiving bonus as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Swift Playgrounds 4 is live on the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYSvEvjw7Zi-az0QEAAqfGSjwKY=/0x57:2400x1657/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278648/12152021_iPad_Swift_Launch_create_ipad_screen.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWNBaw"&gt;Apple’s Swift Playgrounds 4 is upon us. Announced earlier this year at Apple’s WWDC, the new app allows users to develop apps for iOS and iPadOS directly on an iPad. You can preview apps in real time while you work on them and send them directly to the App Store when you’re done. The program is now live on the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id908519492"&gt;App Store for iPad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mF8rza"&gt;“Swift Playgrounds is the best and easiest way to learn how to code,” Apple claimed in &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=v868vy6e&amp;amp;1639593362"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s developer website. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friendly, colorful interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eRp10i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11924120/apple-swift-playground-app-teaches-kids-to-code"&gt;Previous iterations of Swift Playgrounds&lt;/a&gt; have largely been targeted at children. They’re meant to teach beginners how to code in Swift, and they do so through a series of friendly and colorful puzzles. It has not, in the past, functioned as a standalone developer tool — this is the first time that coders will be able to build full apps within the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Mfm5p"&gt;Apps for iPhone and iPad are largely built and distributed in Xcode, a famously complicated application that only runs on macOS. Developers have been calling for an iPad version of Xcode for years, and while this isn’t exactly that, it could still help to lower the barrier to entry for new iPhone and iPad developers who want to try out their ideas without investing in a Mac. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple scrubs controversial CSAM detection feature from webpage but says plans haven’t changed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PE4bW86HfAYrTlwzmeUDjm5YN-Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277130/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="08LtgO"&gt;Apple has updated a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;webpage on its child safety features&lt;/a&gt; to remove all references to the controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611305/apple-scan-photos-iphones-icloud-child-abuse-imagery-neuralmatch"&gt;first announced in August&lt;/a&gt;. The change, which was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/apple-nixes-csam-references-website/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, appears to have taken place some time &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211210163051/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;between December 10th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211213213636/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;December 13th&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the change to its website, the company says its plans for the feature haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkMs8A"&gt;Two of the three safety features, which released earlier this week with iOS 15.2, are still present on the page, which is titled “Expanded Protections for Children.” However references to the more controversial CSAM detection, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;launch was delayed&lt;/a&gt; following backlash from privacy advocates, have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7KASm"&gt;When reached for comment, Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer said that the company’s position hasn’t changed since September, when it first announced it would be delaying the launch of the CSAM detection. “Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers, and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features,” the company’s September statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWxRtC"&gt;Crucially, Apple’s statement does not say the feature has been canceled entirely. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf"&gt;Documents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"&gt;outlining&lt;/a&gt; how the functionality works are still live on Apple’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x2oxlg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7BX0L3"&gt;Apple’s CSAM detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;was controversial&lt;/a&gt; when it was announced because it involves taking hashes of iCloud Photos and comparing them to a database of hashes of known child sexual abuse imagery. Apple claims this approach allows it to report users to the authorities if they’re known to be uploading child abuse imagery without compromising the privacy of its customers more generally. It also says the encryption of user data is not affected and that the analysis be run on-device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9fFJg"&gt;But critics argue that Apple’s system risks undermining Apple’s end-to-end encryption. Some referred to the system as a “backdoor” that governments around the world might strong-arm Apple into expanding into including content beyond CSAM. For its part, Apple has said that it will “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;not accede to any government’s request to expand it&lt;/a&gt;” beyond CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dcz1P8"&gt;While the CSAM detection feature has yet to receive a new launch date, Apple has gone on to release two of the other child-protection features it announced in August. One is designed to warn children when they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;receive images containing nudity in Messages&lt;/a&gt;, while the second provides additional information when searching for terms related to child exploitation through Siri, Spotlight, or Safari Search. Both rolled out with iOS 15.2, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;released earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; and which appears to have prompted Apple to update its webpage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe brings two more desktop tools to Photoshop on iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpApUXWY0MjymkbAmWE3Ov0u8aE=/59x0:1607x1032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270870/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_2.32.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8QGix"&gt;&lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/whats-new/mobile-2022-1.html"&gt;Adobe has updated Photoshop for the iPad&lt;/a&gt; with two crucial new tools — the smudge and sponge tools, which have been mainstays on the desktop version of the app but absent on mobile until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fbG1H"&gt;The smudge tool (as the name suggests) is used to help blur and blend lines or colors together and comes with the usual settings for adjusting size and strength of the effect, along with a variety of modes (including normal, darken, lighten, hue, saturation, color, and luminosity). The sponge tool, on the other hand, works to help retouch images by saturating or desaturating color, allowing users to fine-tune how vibrant their images and art look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DjKsJrK9ogKA23FoYIW2adXEQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087711/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_2.34.54_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="12RbGa"&gt;Additionally, Adobe also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/whats-new.html"&gt;new update for Premiere Pro on desktop&lt;/a&gt;, adding key performance improvements for M1-powered Macs. With the new update, all M1 Macs now work with hardware-accelerated exports for DCI 4K and 8K HEVC formats, which Adobe says will result in “significantly faster performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2H3C7"&gt;Additionally, Adobe is also offering hardware acceleration for ProRes videos on the M1 Max and M1 Pro chips in the latest MacBook Pro laptops, offering up to five times faster performance. Windows users with integrated Intel GPUs are also getting a boost, with improvements to video playback, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJva5p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is requiring masks again at all US retail stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFTDMXcCnSWV9xPeXmYwluX9qjk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270378/acastro_190530_1777_wwdc_2019_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sOfkHh"&gt;Apple is again requiring customers to wear masks in all its US retail stores after it had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1470808052186161155"&gt;reportedly rolled back the mandate for around half of its locations&lt;/a&gt;. In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; the company said that “amid rising cases in many communities, we now require that all customers join our team members in wearing masks while visiting our stores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOqYlz"&gt;While employees have been required to wear masks throughout most of the pandemic, customers haven’t always had to, which has led to outbreaks at some Apple stores. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1470808052186161155"&gt;also reports&lt;/a&gt; that some locations will have occupancy limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B5IAIK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple reportedly started dropping mask mandates for some stores in November&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g8jhBI"&gt;Apple’s current mask policy was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763958/apple-mask-requirements-retail-store-customers-coronavirus"&gt;reportedly enacted in early November&lt;/a&gt; when some retail stores dropped the requirement following increased vaccination rates and decreased infection rates. This cycle seems to be a repeat of what happened this summer — Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;started relaxing mask requirements&lt;/a&gt; for some stores in June but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598686/apple-retail-stores-mask-mandate-requirement"&gt;brought them back&lt;/a&gt; at most locations in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdyi7h"&gt;Apple is reinstating these requirements as the number of COVID infections in the US is again on the rise, even as booster shots start to become widely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i65K1T"&gt;This change also comes after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;widespread outbreak was reported at an Apple store&lt;/a&gt; in Southlake, Texas, earlier this month. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-store-texas-closes-covid-outbreak-rcna8000"&gt;According to NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, 22 employees at the location tested positive for COVID following Black Friday, where some staff reported that customers (who were not required to wear masks) were packed into the store “shoulder to shoulder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ljTxM"&gt;Apple also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures in stores to support the wellbeing of customers and employees.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the iPhone’s new App Privacy Report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i6oUxAjmsCkK_KjPTdkuTVnGPHU=/0x0:828x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269752/IMG_F070E3C6CB84_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vk9q6w"&gt;Information is power, and if you’re an iPhone user, you can now get more information about how often your apps access your data (for example, your location or your microphone). The App Privacy Report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;which became available with iOS 15.2&lt;/a&gt;, also lets you know each app’s web activity and what domains they attach to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDSraO"&gt;The feature is off by default, but if your phone has updated to iOS 15.2, it’s very simple to turn on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2r1zTG"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; App Privacy Report (which will be at the bottom of the screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Y0O6T"&gt;Select “Turn On App Privacy Report”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select App Privacy Report at the bottom of the Privacy screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKPTeO3dThT9NxG1w_fPngDa7b0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087106/IMG_653BB478D14B_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select App Privacy Report at the bottom of the Privacy screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Just turn on the App Privacy Report — and wait." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6utjPixE2dw2VdXXtsROd6Zt7lw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087084/IMG_83D5CB8F00B6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just turn on the App Privacy Report — and wait.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4GD0oA"&gt;After that, you can follow the same series of selections to see your report. (You can also use &lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/71047d5a577b488397247b7a1081e0fd"&gt;this Shortcut&lt;/a&gt; for quicker access right from your home screen or a Siri voice command.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsjoYu"&gt;You won’t immediately see any data — it takes time for your phone to collect the data and assemble the report, but you can start to see results in just a few minutes. The report will let you know the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="IrZ5Yz"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Which apps accessed your data within the last seven days.&lt;/strong&gt; If you tap on one of the apps listed, you will be able to see exactly when the last accesses were. You will probably have to drill down a couple of pages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Privacy Report will give you data on what your apps are accessing." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4xNc2Vp6I4pxQCM1BlxqR_7fS8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087108/IMG_F070E3C6CB84_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Privacy Report will give you data on what your apps are accessing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on an app and you can see when it last accessed your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ox00JIa17EWKJx5AKgAOa1bOlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087111/IMG_181DDC094B17_1.jpeg"&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select iPad models go on sale quite regularly.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;We saw some of the best iPad deals of the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but if you missed out, there are still a couple of decent discounts available. Whether you’re after the high-end iPad Pro or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ehglg9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model, if you can even find it. As a result, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant is $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestiPadDealsDecember&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F674982024&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have previously discounted both Wi-Fi models of the new iPad by $30, which is the steepest discount we’ve seen yet. While Walmart’s listing with that price is still up, the deal appears to have sold out, and other retailers aren’t currently offering comparable sales. If you’re looking for a deal, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling the new 256GB variant with six-month subscriptions to both Apple Music and Apple News Plus. Note that these freebies are only available to new subscribers, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"},{"title":"Apple says the iPad Mini’s jelly scrolling isn’t a problem that needs to be fixed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698590/apple-ipad-mini-jelly-scroll-issue-response-fix-lcd-technology"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KUcr6D"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 has the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations but with refreshed internal specs. It could be a good choice for fans of the classic home button, Touch ID, and a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;We’ve seen the outgoing 64GB iPad Mini with its older A12 Bionic processor drop to as low as $299, and the 256GB model was recently on sale for $495 instead of $550. At the moment, however, we’re not seeing any discounts on the older iPad Mini. Many retailers have discontinued selling the last-gen model, and even refurbished versions are becoming more difficult to find. If you have your eyes set exclusively on the 2019 model, however, Apple is currently selling a refurbished, Wi-Fi-equipped model with 256GB of storage in rose gold for &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1186596/7613?subId1=TheVergeiPadDealRoundup121321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFUQY2LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-iPad-mini-5-Wi-Fi-64GB-Gold" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$469&lt;/a&gt; instead of $549.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6tfbCt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sixth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen, a top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has sadly forfeited its headphone jack in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;Right now, there are no discounts to be had on the sixth-gen Mini. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, however, will throw in six months of Apple Music and Apple News Plus — as well as three months of Apple TV Plus —when you purchase the iPad Mini at full price, assuming you’re a new subscriber. If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at around $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2yrbb"&gt;We’ve previously seen the base model drop to as low as $489. While it’s currently not available for that cheap, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B08J6FD94H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wi-Fi-equipped model with 64GB of storage in green for $569.98&lt;/a&gt;, a modest 5 percent off the typical list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike some of the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance but only if you’re interested in buying the massive 1TB variant. Right now, Best Buy is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcpPjgDOGe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB, Wi-Fi-equipped variant&lt;/a&gt; for $1,099.99 instead of $1,299.99. Additionally, Best Buy will throw in a six-month subscription to Apple News Plus and Apple Music, if you’re a new subscriber, as well as three months of Apple TV Plus. If you prefer the 12.9-inch, 256GB model with Wi-Fi, it’s currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for $929 instead of $1,099.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi starts at $799. While we’ve previously seen the price of this model drop to as low as $649.97, right now Amazon is only selling it in silver for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B0932B5NVD?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749&lt;/a&gt;, which is a modest $50 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhnrgA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10840379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;Meanwhile, the 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon in either silver or gray for $999&lt;/a&gt;, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date. The silver configuration is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also available for the same price at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, where you can also snag the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F385211636%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $1,099&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPaoS2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
