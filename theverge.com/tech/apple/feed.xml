    <title>iPhone 13 rumors grow more certain ahead of September launch</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mUXROz"&gt;Apple’s flagship 2021 iPhones will come in the same sizes as last year’s models, but with a smaller display notch, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/apple-seeks-up-to-20-increase-in-new-iphone-production-for-2021?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This mirrors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553255/apple-iphone-13-camera-2021-ming-chi-kuo-analyst-prediction"&gt;predictions&lt;/a&gt; from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, this year’s phones will be an iterative upgrade over the iPhone 12 series, and will include incremental improvements to their processors, cameras, and displays when they’re announced in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5vKKZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports that “at least one” of the four new devices will include an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display. It’s a technology Apple has previously used with its smartwatches to dynamically adjust their screen refresh rates to conserve battery. That lines up with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;previous prediction from Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt;, who said that both Pro iPhones coming this year would include LTPO displays and 120Hz refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4zSF0O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smaller notches, same screen sizes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bApJhD"&gt;The report also casts doubt on the possibility of seeing an iPhone with an in-display fingerprint sensor this year. Although &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says Apple has tested the technology, it says it’s unlikely to appear in 2021. Way back in 2019, Kuo predicted that Apple’s 2021 iPhone models could be its first to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754520/iphone-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-touch-id-2021-iphones-face-id-biometric-security-rumors"&gt;feature in-display fingerprint sensors&lt;/a&gt;. The phones are also unlikely to include a fingerprint scanner in their power buttons, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;Kuo said in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGI02Y"&gt;Camera upgrades will reportedly include an improved optical zoom for video recording, according to the latest Bloomberg report. Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553255/apple-iphone-13-camera-2021-ming-chi-kuo-analyst-prediction"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; the ultrawide cameras on both Pro models could also receive a boost this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9WNpe"&gt;One area &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t touch on is charging. There have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;been rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Apple might release an iPhone without any ports in 2021, and rely on MagSafe rather than a typical Lightning port for power. But recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;Kuo said&lt;/a&gt; Apple doesn’t think the MagSafe ecosystem is mature enough to act as the sole way of charging the iPhone, suggesting that the Lightning port is here to stay for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlidQu"&gt;Apple is reportedly gearing up for a big iPhone sales cycle. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says it’s ordered up to 90 million units for the initial launch period that extends to the end of 2021, up from a typical order of 75 million seen in recent years. The company appears to be banking on increased demand brought on by more people upgrading to 5G devices, but it may also be set to benefit from sanctions placed on rival Huawei, which was recently forced to delay the launch of its latest flagship. Production of the new iPhones is unlikely to be hit by the global chip shortage because Apple’s size makes it one of chip manufacturer TSMC’s biggest and most important customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdIJ8l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 12 reverse wireless charging can power up Apple’s new MagSafe battery pack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MagSafe Battery Pack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzSMUwyaiCDk3V0izuImjIEnxnY=/0x0:1340x893/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69578556/iphone_magsafe_packa.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MagSafe Battery Pack | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WggYsJ"&gt;Apple surprised us Tuesday by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575678/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-12-pro-mini-max"&gt;simply putting its latest iPhone accessory on sale&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJWY3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F13%2F22576245%2Fiphone-12-reverse-wireless-charging-magsafe-battery-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99 MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the first power cell we’ve seen that uses Apple’s new magnetic system to connect with the iPhone 12 family (Anker&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297307/anker-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack-apple-iphone"&gt; offers a 5,000mAh pack&lt;/a&gt; with slower 5W charging for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Wireless-Portable-Anker-PowerCore/dp/B08TW7BRTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$45.99&lt;/a&gt;), but it is the first one from Apple and can charge at up to 15W while it’s plugged in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUqB6d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-reverse-charging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/13/iphone-12-magsafe-battery-pack-tidbits/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; point out a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"&gt;support document&lt;/a&gt; that helps answer a few questions we immediately had about the device, including confirmation that this will unlock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537855/iphone-12-mini-pro-max-reverse-wireless-charging-fcc-filings-hidden"&gt;the iPhone 12’s “secret” reverse charging feature&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPhone%2B12%2Band%2B12%2BPro%2BTeardown%2F137669%3Fvgo_ee%3D3bheJeT%2FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%2BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F13%2F22576245%2Fiphone-12-reverse-wireless-charging-magsafe-battery-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; didn’t spot any &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21532190/iphone-12-pro-ifixit-teardown-video"&gt;additional hardware&lt;/a&gt; to add wireless charging, FCC filings revealed the company’s plan to let you charge accessories while the iPhone 12 is plugged in and charging, complete with diagrams that now look very familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pmUNepKz-9I_dELMTRPWlEQhJ_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716068/image__4_.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KUpxMe"&gt;As Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XPnozF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charge your MagSafe Battery Pack and your iPhone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASsSk1"&gt;If both your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack need to be charged, you can charge them at the same time. Attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone and then plug the MagSafe Battery Pack into a power adapter. Using a 20W or higher power adapter, the MagSafe Battery Pack can charge your iPhone with up to 15W of charging power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8qV6R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can also charge both if you attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone, then plug your iPhone into a power source.&lt;/strong&gt; You might want to charge this way if you need to connect your iPhone to another device while charging, like if you’re using wired CarPlay or transferring photos to a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhXYqN"&gt;If you charge your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack at the same time, your iPhone might charge to 80% or higher before your MagSafe Battery Pack begins charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oy1UqO"&gt;Notably, reverse charging only works (so far) with this accessory, after an upcoming software update and only while the iPhone 12 is plugged in. Google’s Pixel 5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;can operate as a Qi pad while plugged in&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung devices&lt;/a&gt; have been charging anything you slap against them for a couple of years, but now Apple users can enjoy a similar feature. Will this newfound ability also charge your AirPods, Apple Watch, or anything else in the future? Apple isn’t saying (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wji9Nr"&gt;Also, in case you missed it, one image of the battery pack revealed its capacity specs: 1460mAh, 7.62V, 11.13Wh. We’ll need to do some testing to figure out exactly how much charging it can add in real life, but it’s worth remembering that in this case, watt-hours of charging is the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/watts-in-a-name-why-were-using-watt-hours-to-compare-batteries/"&gt;more important figure to focus on&lt;/a&gt;, as seen with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/16/18185283/apple-iphone-battery-case-size"&gt;Apple’s old non-magnetic battery cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is working on Apple Pay Later to help you buy things without paying for them yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0xgJX3lgPdkm7BYKRsOH2akz8oA=/201x0:2349x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69577207/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.49.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqoVTD"&gt;Even if you haven’t signed up for the Apple Card, you may soon be able to put your purchases on Apple’s tab. Apple is teaming up with Goldman Sachs yet again to turn every Apple Pay transaction into a potential “buy now, pay later” opportunity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — no Apple Card needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RIe9Z"&gt;You know how many online checkout counters across the web tempt you to pay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/23/16516792/affirm-mobile-app-lending-money-launch-virtual-credit-card"&gt;with Affirm&lt;/a&gt; or Klarna or PayPal’s Pay In 4 instead of coughing up the full purchase price at the start,  then they charge you in installments instead? It sounds like this Apple service will be a direct competitor — with the important distinction that this will be baked into hundreds of millions of Apple devices that many people are already using to pay at gobs of physical stores, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tLQjC"&gt;You’ll pay in four interest-free installments over two weeks if you pick “Apple Pay in 4” or pay interest over several months if you pick “Apple Pay Monthly Installments,” writes &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg. &lt;/em&gt;It adds&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that there’s no credit check required, and some plans won’t have late fees. The publication doesn’t say when Apple might launch the service or how much interest it might charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PgBgW"&gt;Apple putting people in debt feels like the ultimate form of lock-in, and it might rub some the wrong way, but the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282946/apple-card-credit-post-iphone-strategy-services-business-digital-wallet-payments"&gt;a knack for sprucing up boring products in the pursuit of services revenue&lt;/a&gt;. If it’s true of Apple Pay Later the way it was true of the Apple Card, there’ll likely be plenty of people who will take Apple’s slightly friendlier terms over the financial industry’s status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fhbue"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just launched an official $99 MagSafe battery pack for the iPhone 12 lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eEfRxBW8iTYh7R0OOqdpnq9_tFI=/0x30:2052x1398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576513/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_9.56.00_AM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4KJcDV"&gt;Apple has launched the MagSafe Battery Pack for its iPhone 12 lineup. One of the magnetic batteries costs $99, and you can order one &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJWY3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;amp;sharedid=AppleMagSafeBatteryVerge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right now from Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;. For me, the website is showing delivery between July 22nd and July 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPH0mk"&gt;Apple has released battery cases for iPhones in the past, but the new pack attaches to the iPhone 12 phones thanks to embedded magnets. And it will work with all four of the phones in the iPhone 12 family — the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARo_k-GReC54LvtfihaLu6EYvzg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715091/MJWY3_AV1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One side of the MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6AepQM"&gt;While the iPhone 11 battery cases had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974475/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-camera-smart-battery-case-shortcut-button"&gt;physical camera shortcut button&lt;/a&gt;, since this accessory is just an attachable pack, that means it doesn’t come with any other features for your phone besides giving you some extra juice. But if it works like the MagSafe wireless charger, you might also be able to use the pack to top up your AirPods or other devices that support Qi wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHGFx6"&gt;Apple says the pack charges with up to 5W of power, so it won’t be the fastest way to charge your phone. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"&gt;In a support page&lt;/a&gt;, Apple also says the battery requires iOS 14.7 — a software update that’s not out yet. Since Apple’s website is showing delivery times for the battery pack for as early as July 22nd, it seems like that update will be out soon to support it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u31Zpm"&gt;Apple also offers a &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK0E3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-arizona%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;amp;sharedid=AppleMagSafeBatteryVerge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wallet that can stick magnetically onto the back of your phone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwn2Mg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 13th, 1:14PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added details of charging speed and that the pack requires iOS 14.7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s weather app won’t say it’s 69 degrees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8ZFtqx_zBsNmgKO6joOOfjyJKA=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575922/weatherapps_watermarked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A weather forecast on iOS 15 compared to the rounded forecast on iOS 14.6 | Photo: Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M4uruv"&gt;If you’re an iPhone user, the weather is always a particularly nice 70 degrees. Or 68 degrees. Any temperature but 69 degrees, actually, because it turns out that the built-in weather app on some versions of iOS — including the current version, iOS 14.6 — will refuse to display &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/06/why-69-is-the-internets-coolest-number-sex.html"&gt;the internet’s favorite number&lt;/a&gt;, even if the actual temperature in a given location is, in fact, 69 degrees, along with several other (less meme-able) numerals like 65 and 71 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WSxGM0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPPrmh"&gt;It’s not clear if this is a bug or an intentional attempt from Apple to cut down on 69-related humor. The rounding is only visible in the weather app itself: clicking through to Apple’s source data from &lt;a href="http://Weather.com"&gt;Weather.com&lt;/a&gt; will show the proper temperature, as do Apple’s home screen widgets. But the iOS weather app will refuse to show 69 degrees anywhere in the forecast, whether it’s for the current temperature, the hourly forecast for the day, or the extended forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaKu8h"&gt;A possible explanation for the issue (as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theMarcDufresne/status/1414981789052030987"&gt;pointed out by several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nannerb/status/1414981582318878722"&gt;people on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) is that Apple may be sourcing data for its iOS Weather app in Celsius and then converting it to Fahrenheit. For example, 20 degrees Celsius converts to 68 degrees Fahrenheit, while 21 degrees Celsius converts to 69.8 degrees Fahrenheit — which rounds up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The app appears to have similar issues with temperatures like 65 degrees (where 18 degrees Celsius converts to 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit, while 19 degrees Celsius is 66.2 degrees Fahrenheit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CU5IC3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10650148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vei02X"&gt;It’s not clear when Apple introduced the rounding here. A phone running iOS 11.2.1 shows accurate data of 69 degrees, as did phones running iOS 15, so it’s possible that the issue is specific to Apple’s most recent update (or has been identified and fixed already). Other weather sources, including Dark Sky — which is owned by Apple — have no issue displaying 69 degrees, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="heuj6P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Apple for additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDuY4o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, July 13th, 12:59PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added potential explanation for the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Apple’s Private Relay feature with iCloud Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJ9c9nReExFghy0D1qAUuly2oT4=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571099/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XNwXJ6"&gt;One of the more interesting new features available with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey is iCloud Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;Apple’s upgraded iCloud subscription service&lt;/a&gt; that adds a few key privacy features. Chief among those features is Private Relay, a VPN-like service that’s designed to mask your internet traffic on your devices from anyone trying to snoop in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDxn53"&gt;Here’s how to use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR0wae"&gt;To start, you’ll have to be using iOS 15, iPadOS 15, or macOS Monterey and be a subscriber to one of Apple’s iCloud plans. All &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318"&gt;paid iCloud plans&lt;/a&gt; — including the $0.99-per-month 50GB plan — are eligible, as are shared family iCloud plans or ones purchased through a shared Apple One subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdgVn7"&gt;Turning on Private Relay is extremely simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g9kVyX"&gt;On an iPhone or iPad, head to Settings &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Private Relay and then toggle on the “Private Relay” switch &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TTeoOd"&gt;On a Mac, head to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud, and check the box labeled “Private Relay”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dcwhq_PV63TgieTpsy7OMRDqLsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712561/IMG_2946.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The toggle for Private Relay in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJtHa8bKqvJZ30MYqv9Drcr5GEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712565/IMG_2947.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Private Relay limits masking your IP address within your existing country and time zone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D89MqC"&gt;Unlike most VPNs, Private Relay only offers one configurable option: the ability to choose your IP address location. Apple gives you two choices here: you can use your “general IP address” so that websites can still give you approximate location data, or you can choose a broader IP address somewhere in your country and time zone (which offers greater anonymity at the expense of more accurate online content). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFMDzO"&gt;Notably, though, Private Relay still only lets you navigate the web through your existing (rough) geographic location, so you can’t use it for more popular VPN activities — like streaming Netflix content from a different country or skirting local sports blackout rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vnmLtG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s missing a few major VPN features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qT2H4x"&gt;Apple says Private Relay is actually more secure than a traditional VPN, noting that traffic is masked twice. When you navigate to a URL in Safari, it’s first sent to Apple, which strips out your identifying IP address information, and then sends it on to a second server — maintained by an as-yet-unidentified third party — to assign a new, temporary IP address. The net result is that neither Apple, the third-party relay company, nor the website can track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MYW61"&gt;There are some limitations to Private Relay. To begin, it’ll be unavailable in a number of countries: China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apples-new-private-relay-feature-will-not-be-available-china-2021-06-07/"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this is due to regulatory limitations in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YthMoV"&gt;In addition, Private Relay only works with Safari — not other web browsers or apps — making it a far more limited option than other VPN services, especially when combined with the fact that it can’t be used for dodging geographic location limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnDmvA"&gt;But considering Private Relay is included as a free add-on for iCloud subscribers, it’s a nice addition, especially if you’re the kind of user who is more interested in the privacy benefits of a VPN for regular web browsing than more specific VPN use cases. The Safari-only limitation could help push users toward using Apple’s browser over competitors like Chrome or Firefox, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Redesigned iPad mini reportedly on track to launch this fall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zJ0aAJjD9jNtttzB5l9X8brVSD0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69569608/akrales_190318_3298_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fifth-generation iPad mini from 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5rP4CJ"&gt;Apple plans to release a new iPad mini featuring “the biggest redesign in [its] nine-year history” this fall, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-07-11/apple-card-would-rival-amex-platinum-and-chase-sapphire-reserve-kqzi5vme?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/11/ipad-mini-redesign-larger-imac-apple-silicon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new device is expected to feature slimmer bezels, a larger display, faster performance, and a design similar to Apple’s new iPad Air from last year, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/sixth-generation-ipad-mini-this-fall/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;. It could be a big shakeup for Apple’s smallest tablet, whose design has remained remarkably consistent since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3576178/apple-ipad-mini-review"&gt;its debut in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zE0Oy5"&gt;The news tallies with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s previous reporting about the upcoming device, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518167/2022-ipad-pro-wireless-charging-new-ipad-mini-2021-date"&gt;it said last month&lt;/a&gt; could ditch the home button to allow for narrower screen bezels. Reports of an iPad Air-style design suggests it could use a Touch ID sensor built into a side-mounted power button. Last year, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/14/ipad-mini-apple-glasses-kuo/"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s next iPad mini could have a screen that’s 8.5 to 9-inches in size, up from the 7.9-inch display the mini has always sported. Kuo has also previously suggested a future iPad mini &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/03/apple-14-1-inch-macbook-pro-mini-led/"&gt;could use a similar Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt; to what we recently saw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Apple’s largest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTfFwn"&gt;The new iPad mini would be the 6th generation of the tablet, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;a 2019 redesign&lt;/a&gt; that added support for the Apple Pencil stylus alongside a faster A12 processor. As well as the new iPad mini, Gurman also reports that Apple also has another Apple Silicon powered iMac on the way with a larger screen than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;recent 24-inch model&lt;/a&gt;. The new device is reportedly intended to replace the existing Intel-powered 27-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The search is over: smart trackers from Apple, Samsung, and Tile compared</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s never been easier to keep track of your keys&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Yn4hTB"&gt;This year will go down in history as the year we entered the golden age of Not Losing Your Stuff. Well, in addition to some other historic milestones, somewhere in the top 100 hits of the year will be the introduction of smart tracker tags from two major mobile device manufacturers: Samsung and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LL5zg"&gt;Tracking tags have been around for a while now, and Tile has been the best-known brand in the space. With new options from the two most popular US phone manufacturers entering the picture, tracking tags may be poised to go mainstream. If you’re thinking of picking one up but unsure where to start, then you’re in the right place. We tried out three top tracking tags — the Samsung SmartTag Plus, Apple AirTag, and Tile Pro — to see how they compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXXOP8"&gt;First, a word about the very real privacy concerns about these tracking devices. Since their introduction, critics have noted that they could all too easily be used as tools for stalkers, since they’re easy to hide in someone’s bag or car. These concerns were amplified when Apple’s AirTags arrived, given how ubiquitous Apple’s Find My network is. Apple built in certain anti-stalking safety measures at launch, but &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-thing-about-apples-airtags-is-also-the-scaries-1846786338"&gt;reporters quickly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/05/apple-airtags-stalking/"&gt;identified ways&lt;/a&gt; that these safeguards fell short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CXhCa4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With new options from the two most popular US phone manufacturers, tracking tags may be poised to go mainstream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2AwmYL"&gt;The company has addressed some issues, like shortening the length of time before an AirTag will sound an alert when it’s separated from its owner, and is working on an app that will allow Android users to find unwanted AirTags near them. But some potential for misuse will remain even with more safety measures in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="au3ILG"&gt;Apple (justifiably) attracts more scrutiny for its safety practices given the size and effectiveness of its tracking network, but it’s hardly alone in its somewhat reactive attitude toward stalking concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22392924/samsung-smartags-tracker-bixby-privacy-smartthings"&gt;Samsung introduced a SmartThings app feature&lt;/a&gt; that scans for unfamiliar SmartTags, and Tile says it’s working on a similar feature. It doesn’t help that these devices more or less live inside their own manufacturer’s walled garden — a unified, cross-platform approach is sorely needed. Anyway, it’s illegal (and highly immoral) to track someone without their knowledge, so don’t do it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayjCuN"&gt;Per usual, adding new tech to your life involves more terms and conditions to agree to. However, in this case you may have already accepted them when you set up your Apple or Samsung phone. Tile’s app, which you must download to use the Pro, presents its own separate set of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-us%2Fterms-of-service&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfRRvwHF0x2ZIq0H7G1fIytsSkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702210/ajohnson_210702_4659_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile has been the best-known brand in the tracking tag space until now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vB8PcA"&gt;Personal trackers are nothing new — GPS and cellular options have been around for quite some time, and offer more precise, real-time location tracking. They also tend to come with a higher price tag, recurring subscription or wireless data fees, and require more battery power. This newer class of Bluetooth trackers are more practical for most people, with battery life measured in months rather than days and smaller, keyring-friendly form factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhiUx0"&gt;Essentially, the three tags compared here all do the same thing. Pair it to your phone, attach it to something you want to keep track of, and you’re ready to go. When the tracker is within Bluetooth range of your phone, you can have the tag play a sound to help locate it. All three devices support out-of-range finding with their own particular device user networks, and they all include the same kind of user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlEXn2"&gt;Their main difference is whether or not they include AR-assisted finding by way of Ultra Wideband (UWB) connectivity: the Samsung and Apple tags have this and the Tile Pro does not. To take advantage of the AR feature, you’ll need a phone with UWB; on the Apple side that’s an iPhone 11 or newer, and for Samsung it’s a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, Z Fold 2, S21 Plus, or S21 Ultra. There are also compatibility differences: Apple’s tracker only works with iOS devices and Samsung’s only works with Galaxy devices (no, you can’t register it through the SmartThings iOS app, I tried), whereas Tile works on both iOS and Android.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMzWKLcxkNQ7oNoAy-D1TFh941U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702209/ajohnson_210702_4659_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTag is the least expensive of the bunch, but without a built-in keyring hole you may need to buy a holder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KkUjYi"&gt;Apple AirTag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="K8LyRt"&gt;The AirTag comes in just one flavor: a small, $29 disc shape. It’s the only one of the three to include an official IP67 rating, meaning it can survive a dunk in a bit of water. It also allows you to store your contact information so it can be read by any phone with NFC (near-field communication) — even Android phones. Setup is dead simple — just bring the tag near your iPhone and you’ll be prompted to pair the two. It’s also a little less expensive than the other two, but there’s no hole built in, so if you want to attach it to a set of keys you’ll need to pay a little more to add a holder. (We don’t really recommend drilling a hole into it, though &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FHow%2Bto%2BDrill%2Ba%2BKeyring%2BHole%2Bin%2Ban%2BAirTag%2F143068&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit has a guide&lt;/a&gt; if you insist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S0KD9T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OP3rsJ"&gt;When it’s outside the Bluetooth range of your phone, the AirTag taps into the massive network of iPhone devices using Find My to provide an approximate location. This is a huge benefit, especially in the US where iPhones abound. As long as your item is in a place with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it will likely be “seen” by an iPhone nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XmpgHp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As long as your item is in a place with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it will likely be “seen” by an iPhone nearby&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkECyk"&gt;In-range, AR-assisted finding does a good job of tracking down an object that’s out of sight. A big, easy-to-follow arrow appears on screen when the signal is strong enough (you’ll be prompted with a vague message to move around if you’re too far for a strong signal) and guides you in the right direction. I had no problem locating a tag under a couch cushion in my house. It would be helpful if the “weak signal” message indicated if the signal got stronger as you move around (Samsung’s AR finding does this) but that’s my only complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0q41aP"&gt;If you’d like to altogether avoid the headache of leaving something behind, Apple is adding a separation alert feature in iOS 15 that may help. Once set up, it will send a notification if it detects that your iPhone (and by extension, you) have gone out of range and left it behind. Tile also offers this feature with its Premium subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Zu4DCPNye2enQZo0XfHl_FbQL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702211/ajohnson_210702_4659_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmartTag Plus includes AR-assisted finding for objects in close range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="07bZ8a"&gt;Samsung SmartTag Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dHJGkw"&gt;The $39 SmartTag Plus is Samsung’s UWB-equipped tag; there’s also a non-UWB version for $10 less. The SmartTag Plus offers broadly similar Bluetooth-range finding and AR-assist as the AirTag, with a few differences. AR finding mode provides a view through the phone’s camera with guiding arrows that appear on the screen, which is a little more helpful than Apple’s arrow-only guide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="doXMn8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDi1au"&gt;You can also use the button on a SmartTag as a kind of remote starter for smart home automations if you’re invested in Samsung’s SmartThings ecosystem. On the downside, the SmartTag has the shortest battery life rating of the three trackers compared here: up to 165 days (less than six months) compared to about a year for the Tile and Apple options. SmartTags don’t offer separation alerts at the moment either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QZmIv6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the SmartTag gave me an accurate enough location that I could have driven up I-5 myself and located the tag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yBoLCQ"&gt;Out-of-range, the SmartTag Plus relies on other Galaxy devices that have chosen to participate in Samsung’s Galaxy Find network — Galaxy phone users aren’t opted in by default, and need to give consent in the SmartThings app. Samsung says that as of April 2021, there were &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745743505176533597" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more than 70 million “helper devices” participating globally&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple counts hundreds of millions of users&lt;/a&gt; in its Find My network. There are simply fewer people in the US with Galaxy phones than iPhones, so it can’t quite compete with the AirTag, but that’s a moot point anyway since nobody is likely to be comparison shopping between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2tdm2"&gt;Experiences will vary — more so than with an AirTag — but at least in the northern suburbs of Seattle, there were enough Galaxy Find users out and about to track a tag on a cross-town journey with multiple stops. Knowing the actual location of the object, er, spouse who agreed to let me track him, the SmartTag did identify his position accurately at two of three stops. It only returned a location a couple of times when he was on the interstate getting to his destination, but in a fairly busy business park and at a restaurant, the SmartTag gave me an accurate enough location that I could have driven up I-5 myself and located the tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eNM85lo7N16YWsKU7QsiGNbEksk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702206/ajohnson_210702_4659_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile’s tags work with both iOS and Android devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="quRzYe"&gt;Tile Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6mesvM"&gt;Tile has been the tracking tag category heavyweight of the last few years — at least until Samsung and Apple showed up. The Pro is the company’s highest-specced model at $34, with a bigger Bluetooth range (400 feet) and a louder maximum ring volume than other current Tile tags. There’s no Ultra Wideband here, and thus no AR-assisted finding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yAgNuq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="btTY78"&gt;Separation alerts are available as part of Tile’s $29/year Premium subscription, but all of the essential features are included with your Tile tag purchase, including out-of-range finding. This “community find” feature relies on other Tile users — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424837/tile-amazon-sidewalk-support-release-date-2021-bluetooth-tracking-airtags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as of June 14th, Amazon’s Sidewalk network&lt;/a&gt; — the way Samsung and Apple’s trackers rely on other Galaxy phones and iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WzYkQ"&gt;Even with help from Sidewalk, the Tile Pro’s peer-location network seems to lag behind Samsung and Apple’s. On the same journey up I-5 that the SmartTag Plus took, the Tile Pro returned a location ping less frequently, and only got one of the stops on the trip precisely right (it was close but across the street on another one) where the SmartTag was accurate on two locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mUmqjJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even with help from Sidewalk, the Tile Pro’s peer-location network seems to lag behind Samsung and Apple’s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OJlei"&gt;This was honestly a better performance than I was expecting, though Seattle probably has more than its usual share of Sidewalk-supporting Amazon devices for obvious reasons. Even if it’s an atypical result, it’s fair to say that the community find feature would work well enough to tell you that you really &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; lose something, even if it’s less likely that you’ll be able to hunt down its exact location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbsdOV"&gt;I do have one minor complaint to lodge against the Tile app: the subscription upsell. A couple of app menus include features that are only available with the Premium plan, and tapping them brings up a page prompting you to start a free trial to access them. I expect to see those kinds of things during setup, or if I’m using a free app like Strava, but it’s a little annoying from something I’ve already paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlbF1T"&gt;Tile also offers its trackers in a couple of different form factors, including a wallet-friendly Slim version and a small adhesive-backed Sticker tag. There are plenty of third-party cases and holders for AirTags in particular if you want to adapt it for different objects, but you can’t buy an AirTag or a SmartTag in a fundamentally different shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="btAqHr"&gt;AirTag or Tile Pro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XqsNHq"&gt;If you have an iPhone, there’s a very simple answer to this question: just get the AirTag. The Apple Find My network is so extensive (at least in the US) that you’ll have the best chance of tracking down something the tag is attached to. Maybe there’s an exception to this recommendation if you really want Tile’s subscription features or mix of form factors, but by and large this is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RWH2Kx"&gt;SmartTag Plus or Tile Pro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pbD9SM"&gt;If you have a Samsung phone you’ll probably be better off with the SmartTag Plus. The Galaxy Find network isn’t as robust as Apple’s, but it’s still ahead of Tile’s. If you already use smart home devices in Samsung’s SmartThings network, then there’s even more reason to choose SmartTag since it can act as a remote control for automations. The shorter battery life is a shame and the lack of separation notifications stinks, so if those are sticking points you could consider the Tile Pro. Otherwise, the SmartTag Plus (or non-UWB version, depending on your phone) is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YS3j0F"&gt;Tile or… ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FHfboY"&gt;If you don’t have an iPhone or a Galaxy device, your choice is between the Tile Pro and… everything else. Tile’s out-of-range network can’t compete with the number of devices Samsung and Apple have in our pockets, but it seems to be getting a healthy boost from Sidewalk, and can only get better as more people add Echo and Ring devices to their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7nh3V8"&gt;If community finding features are less important, &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en/pages/products" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chipolo is worth a look&lt;/a&gt;. We didn’t test it in this batch, but it does include separation notifications without an annual fee. Overall, the Tile Pro feels like a good compromise between paying for something more expensive and power-intensive like a cellular tracker, or a more basic, Bluetooth-only tracker. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants in on NFL Sunday Ticket</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NFL: JAN 03 Cardinals at Rams" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Owq7vq-V_FDWyTT4iUokJpfv5OQ=/0x107:3400x2374/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562937/1230461244.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iRhDMy"&gt;In the quest to get people to pay monthly for video, having the rights to stream sports, especially football, is key. Apple might finally be playing that game to spruce up Apple TV Plus: &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-in-early-talks-with-nfl-on-sunday-ticket-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the trillion-dollar phone maker has expressed early interest in securing the rights to the NFL’s Sunday Ticket package — a subscription covering every game that is not airing on local affiliates —  for its video service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJRiRn"&gt;The NFL has reportedly not entered into actual negotiations yet, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ourand_SBJ/status/1413534186208600065?s=20"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Sports Business Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s John Ourand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and Apple likely won’t be the only company competing. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; writes that other streaming competitors, like Disney’s ESPN Plus and Amazon’s Prime Video, are likely also trying to secure even more games for their platforms. Currently Sunday Ticket is held by DirecTV, but its contract is up in 2022, which means there's an opportunity to shop around for an even more lucrative deal. DirecTV is also going through its own transition, as AT&amp;amp;T plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301840/att-tpg-directv-tv-uverse-new-company-announced"&gt;spin out the satellite company&lt;/a&gt; and its other non-WarnerMedia video businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVddp6"&gt;Sunday Ticket was actually a condition for AT&amp;amp;T merging with DirecTV in the first place in 2014. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/19/5730854/att-can-bail-on-merger-if-directv-loses-nfl-sunday-ticket"&gt;gave itself an out of its then-$48.5 billion deal&lt;/a&gt; if DirecTV wasn’t able to reach an agreement with the NFL. It ultimately did, but according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, the service has mainly lost DirecTV and AT&amp;amp;T money heading into 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HjvvsK"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said it would “pay net losses” on the Sunday Ticket up to $2.5 billion over the remaining period of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ELAGP2"&gt;There’s good reason to take Apple seriously, even if it’s not ultimately able to secure the bag. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-jim-delorenzo-live-sports-streaming-841a91c7-24d9-4f69-98c9-b60dabb8f1bc.html"&gt;The company poached Jim DeLorenzo&lt;/a&gt;, the former Amazon executive in charge of leading the company’s sports efforts, in 2020. He could be very well be scheduling lunches with NFL bigwigs as I write this, though it’s not clear what a deal would look like with Apple. Amazon has developed a successful relationship with the NFL over the years, gaining exclusive rights to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417957/amazon-nfl-thursday-night-football-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, so maybe the groundwork DeLorenzo laid there will transfer over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQ58fy"&gt;Either way, the heat is on, and with Apple trying to make TV Plus even more enticing, it's yet another hand trying to exchange money for the most watched sport on US television.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best streaming device to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4898BPrHNtUJ2D0ryKE7CVuH4mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67310264/DSCF2108.7.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Getting something great only costs $50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NGkXEr"&gt;Looking for a new TV gadget to stream all of your favorite entertainment? Buying an excellent streaming device is easier in 2021 than ever before — and the prices only continue to drop and get more appealing: $50 is the sweet spot if you want a streaming stick or set-top box that can do crisp 4K resolution, Dolby Vision / HDR, and immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound. Each of the picks below has its own strengths, whether it’s a snazzier interface, better voice controls, or a more comprehensive universal search for digging through all of your services. Depending on your wants, there are several good contenders, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the best streaming device for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xj845F"&gt;Pretty much any 4K TV you buy today will come with a batch of built-in streaming apps. But they won’t always have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. (For example, my LG OLED still somehow doesn’t have HBO Max.) So a dedicated streaming device is the best way to guarantee you’ll be able to watch that show or movie everyone’s been talking about. You can spend less money on entry-level Roku or Amazon streaming players, but you’ll be better off with one of our recommendations if you want your purchase to last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pz52a6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503888"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4mn8ET"&gt;BEST STREAMING DEVICES OF 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2VmT6S"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of the Google Chromecast, the best streaming stick of 2021 for most people, resting on a soundbar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kOzUEubtlPeu7op7nTCzq0zBPLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21924603/DSCF2097_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features and fantastic price of the Chromecast with Google TV make it the best streaming stick for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9cOJvp"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best streaming stick for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3U9Abh"&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the home screen on a streaming stick should look like. That’s really the long and short of why the Chromecast with Google TV has taken the crown of best streaming player. With its new Google TV software, the company has taken a content-first approach that feels more focused and refined than what Amazon and Apple have managed in their own attempts to aggregate popular shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lr5ZDG"&gt;On a Roku or Fire TV, my instinct is always to head right for the app where I want to watch something. But with the Chromecast, I’m equally happy browsing through Google’s rows of recommendations. The Google TV software always clearly shows where content is coming from — you can pick which streaming apps get factored into these recs — and it also provides helpful information (like Rotten Tomatoes ratings) at the surface level when you’re hunting for that night’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XINYdJ"&gt;When you actually hit play, you’re punted over to Netflix or Prime Video or HBO Max just like always, but there’s no avoiding that. In terms of app selection, Google’s got all of the main players covered. You can still cast content to the Chromecast from your phone or laptop, and Google Assistant voice searches consistently work well and showcase Google’s accurate voice recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHgD8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the software on a streaming device should look like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKXPL"&gt;Everything about Google TV feels tasteful, from the fonts to the way the background color subtly shifts to match the artwork of whatever content is highlighted. And the universal Watchlist, which lets you put together a list of stuff you’re interested in from various streaming services, is super convenient — especially since you can add to it from the web or your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUEQwj"&gt;But not everything about the Chromecast with Google TV is perfect. The software can slow down from time to time, and some customers have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/07/chromecast-google-tv-data-corrupt-android-cant-load-error/"&gt;encountered significant bugs&lt;/a&gt; that Google has tried to iron out with software updates. More annoyingly, despite the hardware supporting both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, there are still very popular apps like Disney Plus — which delivers both on other platforms — that aren’t doing so on the Chromecast. HBO Max says it does Atmos, but that hasn’t been my experience. Why? Who knows, but these inconsistencies are a mark against Google. And as for the Watchlist, some services like Netflix have already started removing their shows from it. Again, that’s something Google has no control over, but it does lessen the feature’s usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e1vJvx"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, the best streaming device for ease of use, plugged into a TV." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GeG7Xng7wS70oeIPS1EBLvuW_9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9578455/akrales_171031_2100_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With its easy-to-use software, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is the best streaming device for people looking for a good, simple option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z2csvA"&gt;2. Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hOCseD"&gt;The best streaming device for people who want to keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7O9OD"&gt;It’s hard to really complain about a Roku. The company’s streaming devices are about as simple and straightforward as they come. All of your apps are laid out in a big grid, which can make the experience feel a bit siloed — but there’s no beating that ease of use. And Roku has tried to touch up and modernize the home screen a bit with new sections like “Featured Free” to highlight content you can stream without any subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qjIbaE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGj91j"&gt;Despite some occasional spats with content companies, Roku now has pretty much all of the entertainment you could want, including (most recently) HBO Max and Peacock. And the wonderfully neutral universal search remains one of the best aspects of the platform, favoring your existing subscriptions and free-to-stream options over making you pay money to rent or buy. And the company’s Roku Channel has grown into a legitimate streaming app of its own, offering a mix of ad-sponsored movies, TV shows, and live news for those days when you’re burned out on combing through Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVnPjT"&gt;The $50 Streaming Stick Plus remains the best overall pick among Roku’s hardware when you weigh price and performance. It gives you HDR, Dolby Atmos, and speedy performance. The main thing you’ll miss out on is Dolby Vision. If that’s a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, you should look at the $100 Roku Ultra set-top box instead, which also includes an Ethernet port for optional wired connectivity and a helpful remote finder feature. Plus, the Ultra’s remote has customizable shortcut buttons and a headphone jack so you can listen privately to whatever’s on-screen if you’re trying to keep quiet at night. (Other Rokus let you do the latter with the company’s mobile app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IoeY"&gt;If there’s one area where Roku falls flat, it’s probably voice search. Your voice queries for specific shows or movies should work well enough, but Roku lags Amazon and Google when it comes to natural language interactions. (And forget about using your voice to control smart home gadgets or look up entertainment-related facts.) Still, the company is adding other perks to offset that weakness. Late last year, it added support for Apple’s AirPlay, letting you easily send content from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the TV screen. Speaking of Apple…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mqu6OJ02NVqztRrNUIgGTb3A18E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541100/DSCF3875_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV 4K offers the most consistent, reliable performance of any streaming device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JRXodl"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K (second-generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWJwP1"&gt;The best streaming device overall experience (for a steep price)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="M2y4K0"&gt;It’s fair to look at the Apple TV 4K as overpriced compared to its competitors, but Apple’s set-top box still has its own set of appealing qualities. The interface is fantastic. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos across a wide variety of services, has all of the important apps checked off, and also gives you add-ons like Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness Plus (if you pay for them) that you won’t find on other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0yQqy"&gt;Apps sometimes have a higher level of polish on Apple TV and are generally better about taking advantage of everything the box can do. Another benefit of the Apple TV is privacy — to some extent. Apple itself isn’t obsessed with tracking your viewing data in the same way that a company like Roku is, but the streaming apps can still see what you’re doing. I generally think consumers aren’t particularly averse to sharing their streaming habits, but Apple’s privacy practices might matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUc2Xv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7S0fB"&gt;Even with AirPlay now on Roku, the Apple TV still wins out for people deeply invested in Apple’s ecosystem. You can use HomePods as its speakers or connect two sets of AirPods for private listening with audio sharing. You can view the feed from HomeKit security cameras or see who is at the door if you have a HomeKit video doorbell. The Apple TV still makes it easy to tap into content on a Mac in your home, and services like Apple Music and iCloud Photo Library are right there in easy reach on the TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0nOC"&gt;And with the 2021 model of the Apple TV 4K, Apple has finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;redesigned the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; with a much simpler, more intuitive button layout that adds power and mute controls. It’s larger and harder to lose in the couch cushions, too. The second-gen Apple TV 4K is also now more future-proofed as a smart home hub with the inclusion of Thread support.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K checks off all the boxes for HDR support and costs just $50, making it the best streaming stick for people in Amazon’s ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6ajwme"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mO4Da0"&gt;The best streaming stick if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iAlxyK"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is yet another popular pick in that $50 range of streaming gadgets. The latest model added support for Dolby Vision, which made it the only product to offer everything HDR (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, HDR10) for such little money — until the new Chromecast came along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HanEXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oDfmk8"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K’s software is similar to the Chromecast in that the home screen takes a content-focused approach instead of just throwing a grid of apps at you. Amazon tends to showcase its own Prime Video content more prominently than shows and movies from other services, but the newly revamped software goes a long way in improving the look and feel of the Fire TV. Alexa voice commands with the remote also work reliably, whether you’re saying “open Netflix” or asking to dim the smart lights in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0rvix"&gt;Amazon offers most major streaming apps, but there are some frustrating omissions: Vudu — a good source of Dolby Vision movies — and Peacock are both still absent from the Fire TV platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i6E5A2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351738"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JiAvz9"&gt;There’s also the $120 Fire TV Cube to consider. It essentially doubles as a streaming device and small smart speaker. Rather than make you press and hold a button to speak to Alexa like with the Stick 4K, the Cube takes a hands-free approach and has beamforming mics that respond to “Alexa” prompts just like an Echo speaker would. It also features something Amazon calls Local Voice Control, which allows it to understand more spoken commands without needing help from the cloud. The Fire TV Cube has a more powerful processor than the Fire TV Stick 4K, making it the fastest of the Fire TV bunch, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pssjk4"&gt;When it comes to their streaming capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube are on equal footing. And you could always put the money you save by going with the Stick toward one of those new sphere-shaped Echo Dots, which will sound far better than the Cube’s tinny built-in speaker. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV is a powerful Android TV streaming box that’s popular with home theater enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qJ9DFz"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ktAsFL"&gt;Best streaming device for home theater enthusiasts and gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bTK5Wu"&gt;Home theater enthusiasts, gamers, and people who like to tinker with their streaming devices have loyally stuck with Nvidia’s Shield TV and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. They can serve as excellent players like any of our other picks, but you can also go more advanced and use them for cloud gaming or set up a Plex media library (in the case of the Pro). GeForce Now and Steam Link probably do more to sell gamers on the Shield lineup versus something like Apple Arcade on the Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="useqbH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmo5EB"&gt;The Nvidia Shields currently run Android TV with Google Assistant built in, but it’s expected they’ll eventually get the same Google TV experience that’s on the Chromecast. Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling can eke out some extra detail from the shows and movies you stream, and I’d rate the included remote control (with backlit buttons, even) as the most ergonomic of them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVfT5g"&gt;But like with the Apple TV, the main hurdle here is the price. The Nvidia Shield TV costs $150, so you’re looking at spending $100 more than devices that offer most of the same functionality. You get Ethernet and a very powerful streaming device for the added premium, and you can push the Shield TV farther and make it do more than just about any of its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
