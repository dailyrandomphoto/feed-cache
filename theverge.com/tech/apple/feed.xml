    <title>The Apple TV’s touchpad swipes and misses at being a good remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SabX-zpnBqRdZwClYeBz2FzeBXs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873060/akrales_210224_4406_0066.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLMbFe"&gt;It’s rare to find a button that is almost universally hated, but the infamous touchpad on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9630952/new-apple-tv-4-review"&gt;Apple TV’s Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; might be the exception. Even over half a decade after its introduction, it stands as one of the most reviled pieces of hardware around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwJD7m"&gt;The failings of the Apple TV remote don’t just stem from a bad touchpad (and don’t get me wrong: it is bad) but from a larger misunderstanding on Apple’s part of what makes a good remote and the fundamental purpose of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvoWpW"&gt;The typical TV remote is big and ugly, but it’s also extremely easy to find and navigate thanks to differing patterns of buttons that make it clear what you’re touching even without checking. Generally speaking, no one has ever been too confused about how to find the giant rubber rocker that says “VOLUME” or what the huge, often glowing red power button does. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLS6K3kwl5u3N2_vz0zI62VUd8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326742/akrales_210224_4406_0053.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bcDXgq"&gt;Apple’s remotes have always been far simpler and smaller, but its older models still had distinct buttons for key features like navigation and controlling playback. And crucially, you could tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LfLoF"&gt;But the so-called Siri Remote broke from those designs when it was introduced alongside the fourth-generation Apple TV in 2015. The new Apple TV featured the biggest revamp of Apple’s set-top box ambitions to date, introducing its tvOS platform, an App Store, and the goal of becoming a one-stop shop for all your TV needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fVaRDb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS-style apps meant an iOS-style control scheme&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zzKoxi"&gt;The remote was designed to complement those ambitions. Most notably, the directional pad was removed and replaced with a featureless touchpad that was meant to more closely emulate the touchscreens found on iPhones and iPads. After all, the Apple TV could run iOS-style apps now, so presumably it needed an iOS-style control scheme to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3Kd2R"&gt;But in its pursuit of emulating the smartphone experience, Apple lost sight of the key elements of a good TV remote. The Siri Remote’s slimmed-down glass and aluminum design looked fantastic. In practice, though, the diminutive remote was even easier to lose than its already small predecessors, with a design that seems to be tailor-made for slipping between couch seats and underneath cushions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DBLrvP6y_4MlyyGfb7NPrHMZ8iQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326745/akrales_210224_4406_0094.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nF9oVk"&gt;The minimalist design stripped the remote down to just just a few buttons, but the virtually symmetrical layout made it nearly impossible to distinguish between those buttons in the dark (say, when watching a movie). Pick up the remote the wrong way, and instead of hitting the play / pause button to stop your show, you might hit the TV button — which boots you out of the show and takes you to Apple’s overstuffed TV app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKfXK2"&gt;Add in software updates that have changed what those buttons actually do (the TV button used to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tv-remote-home-button-changed-by-apple-2019-9#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20pressing%20the%20%22TV,rest%20of%20your%20apps%20live."&gt;work as a home button&lt;/a&gt; until Apple released the TV app in 2019), and it’s another indictment of the remote’s chase of form over function. Even Apple seems to be aware of this: when it refreshed the Siri remote for the fifth-generation Apple TV 4K, it added a white ring to the menu button to make it slightly easier to tell which side is up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvqEWo"&gt;And then there’s the touchpad. With only its matte texture serving to distinguish it from the glossy grip of the remote, it suffers from the same orientation issues as the other buttons. Pick up the remote the wrong way, and you’ll either end up swiping on useless glass when you meant to move around the OS or flinging your way through a show when you meant to just grab the remote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wrMjWx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The touchpad is just plain bad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKPeVA"&gt;Even if you can orient it the right way, the overly sensitive and opaque nature of the touchpad makes it easy to overshoot whatever it was you were trying to do in the first place. In theory, the touchpad is a useful tool for playing games, swiping through pages of apps, and effortlessly panning through a Netflix show. In practice, it’s terrible at nearly all of those tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPEDhE"&gt;The remote is such a problem that when Swiss TV and internet provider Salt started offering Apple TVs as set-top boxes, it worked with Apple to make a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/9/21002605/apple-tv-remote-salt-swiss-tv-company-replacement-buttons-normal"&gt;simpler, more traditional remote control&lt;/a&gt; to offer customers instead. One of the biggest changes is a swap from the touchpad to a regular, rubber D-pad. The touchpad promises limitless functionality, but it’s so hard to use that a &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; versatile input method is actually more useful. (The $20 Salt remotes routinely sell on eBay for nearly triple their value to disgruntled customers in other markets.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WPb0i-Ad_mYulNmI0GmqC4rG5XE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326746/akrales_210224_4406_0105.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1BJpAo"&gt;But for all those issues, the Siri Remote’s failures all stem from a common cause: the smartphone-ification of the traditional TV remote. The svelte design and touchpad interface are things that helped skyrocket the original iPhone to its massive success. But for a TV remote — a device that needs to be easily found in a sea of throw pillows and function simply without requiring that you tear your eyes away from the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; — they’re precisely the wrong traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UB7f1H"&gt;Apple made a remote control that’s an undeniably beautiful piece of hardware. Outside of the Siri Remote, how many TV remotes can claim to actually look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;? But the touchpad’s minimalism and misplaced attempt at trying to turn the entire remote into something that it’s not makes it like other failed Apple buttons before it: a stark warning of the dangers of chasing form over function. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overcast overhauls its Apple Watch app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SXtyWAMsl4ChX8JMzdaDOXkvstQ=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872032/IMG_1337_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kXVs25"&gt;A new update to popular podcast player &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm"&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt; includes a major overhaul of its Apple Watch app. The Apple Watch support is notable at a time when third-party app development for the platform is not necessarily in a great spot, though the Watch itself continues to grow in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EWM1X"&gt;Overcast’s update reorganizes the app UI from top to bottom, adding some features that otherwise were only able to be accessed through the phone version. The main screen has large buttons for settings and syncing above a scrolling list of your shows and access to the “now playing” screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoXK26"&gt;That screen now includes a button on the bottom right that takes you to more detailed info on the podcast and lets you adjust its playback speed, as well as giving you the ability to skip directly through chapters on podcasts that have them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPtCUOTDx-UFlGAdUDAdrx6Ul8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327758/overcast.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ArC1lb"&gt;Release notes for the new iOS version of Overcast, which is dubbed 2021.1, note a couple of extra changes without going into details. Other than the new Watch app, Overcast now has “improved Siri support” and “tons of under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddXyoR"&gt;Overcast is &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857"&gt;available for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and now M1-powered Macs because of their support for running iOS apps. The app is free but ad-supported, with an optional $9.99 subscription that can remove the ads.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG: New State is a futuristic new battle royale game for Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FG35rvlSegFMS6_TcQniVYhW-0w=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68871803/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Key_Art_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t2yXxQ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe is expanding with a new mobile title for iOS and Android called &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State, &lt;/em&gt;which catapults the battle royale ahead in time for a more futuristic take on the massive multiplayer genre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRcioC"&gt;Set in 2051, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; takes place years after the current &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games (which are set in approximately modern times) on a new map called Troi and promises to bring with it a slew of near-future weapons and vehicles, like drones and deployable combat shields. Based on the early images, it’s a similar vibe to fellow shooter &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s semi-futuristic military tech from games like &lt;em&gt;Black Ops 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJD19c"&gt;The new game is also set to dive deeper into the &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/"&gt;lore of the overall &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently a thing that surprisingly exists for a game whose most notable cultural signifier is the use of a cast-iron skillet as a weapon. What the time jump will mean for beloved &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; characters like &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/en/character/lunchmeat"&gt;Lunchmeat&lt;/a&gt;, though, will have to wait for the game’s release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVi79IthSp1c0u7cD0MoZHZZuoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326840/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Screenshot_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kSJ0pM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; also promises to shake up the formula for &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games, with in-game weapon customization options that will allow players to modify their weapons within a match in a way that sounds similar to &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ weapon attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCeBU6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; marks the third battle royale game under the &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; umbrella — although, unlike its mobile cousin &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; will be developed by PUBG Studio, the company behind &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, the PC and console version of the original game. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21399585/pubg-mobile-update-esports-tournament-2-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; is actually a separate title&lt;/a&gt; developed by Chinese tech giant Tencent.) And despite the mobile nature of the title, PUBG Studio is making big promises of “ultra-realistic graphics that push the limits of mobile gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccKBKW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State &lt;/em&gt;will be available on Android and iOS later in 2021, with alpha tests also set for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6FdkD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s MagSafe-compatible battery pack will stick to your iPhone on March 3rd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUkJvKxpb_JVOOPLYZf3-bXege8=/0x0:1170x780/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863057/AnkerMagSafe.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="On60Zk"&gt;Anker has released a new MagSafe-compatible battery pack that can attach directly to your iPhone to offer charging without the need for a cable, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/23/anker-magsafe-compatible-iphone-12-battery/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The Anker PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless Power Bank will launch on March 3rd for $39.99, beating Apple’s own rumored MagSafe battery product to market — with one big caveat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJlmtf"&gt;The PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless Power Bank sports a 5,000mAh battery and Anker’s usual power bank design, including an LED indicator light to let you know how much power is left in the device. The device also features USB-C output for charging with a cable as well. An extra 5,000mAh is a meaningful boost, especially for the smaller iPhone 12 mini, but it’s limited by the device’s lack of MagSafe certification. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHIYK9hTvW2-ezU0TtjFSkoGdlo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22323363/AnkerMagSafeCharger.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker’s new PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless Power Bank looks remarkably similar to its other PowerCore power banks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Oda07d"&gt;Certified devices, like Apple’s own chargers, can charge the iPhone at 15W, while the PowerCore is stuck with slower 5W charging. Its magnets may let it stick where other MagSafe accessories go, but the PowerCore can’t offer the usual MagSafe benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4tdqd"&gt;Apple’s been rumored to be developing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22290938/apple-magsafe-iphone-battery-pack-report"&gt;its own MagSafe battery accessory&lt;/a&gt; for iPhones, which would likely be capable of the faster 15W charging times. Apple’s device was initially referenced in the iOS 14.5 beta, but that reference has since been removed. Until that accessory is released (if it ever is), Anker’s new PowerCore seems like a solid option for more convenient wireless charging on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMu12T"&gt;The $39.99 PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless Power Bank was &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Wireless-Portable-Anker-PowerCore/dp/B08TW7BRTJ?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=anker+magnetic+power+bank+iphone+12&amp;amp;qid=1614091126&amp;amp;sr=8-6&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=9to5g-20&amp;amp;linkId=3d7c961c21dab3e2c1754a7f4df4b85b&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; but has since gone out of stock. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Anker about restocks of the device ahead of its March 3rd launch and will update if we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has finally added iOS’s privacy labels to Gmail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDiTaGgRPH8tpV59gVwCp7BsgcU=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859215/IMG_0879.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Pn0zK"&gt;Google has finally added Apple App Store privacy labels to its Gmail app, almost a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250648/google-apple-app-store-privacy-label"&gt;we ran an article wondering what was taking so long&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The app is the second major Google app to get the labels, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/13/22282000/google-bug-fix-ios-youtube-app-privacy-apple-gmail-docs-search-update"&gt;they were added to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; when it was updated earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaNAl"&gt;According to the privacy label, it doesn’t collect your name, physical address, or phone number (though as an email client, Gmail obviously collects your email address). Location data is also used for analytics and there are some features of the app that will request it as well. If you want to see the full label, there’s a video below that scrolls through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xqi01Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What does the app privacy label for Gmail look like? See for yourself. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LpOPfg4Iq2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LpOPfg4Iq2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1364014742419828743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jIwgfq"&gt;For contrast, here’s the app privacy information for another email app, Hey. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIoCTNloyt8hSUXVNmV2j_Uazt8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22321818/IMG_0882.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The information Hey requests fits on one page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="57dzTT"&gt;It is worth noting that Apple’s app privacy labels are meant to show all the things that the app &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; access, not what information that app &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; access. For example, an app may only use location data when it needs to show you a map, but the privacy labels don’t make that clear — it’s just a binary used/not used. Also, the information in the labels is submitted by the company itself, and Apple doesn’t make promises about its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59vquM"&gt;Strangely, Google added the labels without actually updating the Gmail app, even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277304/google-ios-apps-out-of-date-update-message"&gt;it was literally crying out for an update&lt;/a&gt; (because of a fun bug). The last time Google updated the iOS app was two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zzyIO"&gt;So far, Google’s other large apps like Maps, Photos, Docs, and Chrome haven’t gotten the labels yet. But the fact that both YouTube and Gmail have had them added indicates that Google is starting to roll them out to its bigger apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYFfnK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction February 23rd, 3:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this story said that Google shared your course location and user ID with advertisers. However, Google told us it does not share this information with advertisers. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best streaming device to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Getting something great only costs $50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="R6sqE4"&gt;Looking for a new TV gadget to stream all of your favorite entertainment? Buying an excellent streaming device is easier in 2021 than ever before — and the prices only continue to drop and get more appealing: $50 is the sweet spot if you want a streaming stick or set-top box that can do crisp 4K resolution, Dolby Vision / HDR, and immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound. Each of the picks below has its own strengths, whether it’s a snazzier interface, better voice controls, or a more comprehensive universal search for digging through all of your services. Depending on your wants, there are several good contenders, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the best streaming device for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xj845F"&gt;Pretty much any 4K TV you buy today will come with a batch of built-in streaming apps. But they won’t always have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. (For example, my LG OLED doesn’t have HBO Max.) So a dedicated streaming device is the best way to guarantee you’ll be able to watch that show or movie everyone’s been talking about. You can spend less money on entry-level Roku or Amazon streaming players, but you’ll be better off with one of our recommendations if you want your purchase to last. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features and fantastic price of the Chromecast with Google TV make it the best streaming stick for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9cOJvp"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best streaming stick for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3U9Abh"&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the home screen on a streaming stick should look like. That’s really the long and short of why the Chromecast with Google TV has taken the crown of best streaming player. With its new Google TV software, the company has taken a content-first approach that feels more focused and refined than what Amazon and Apple have managed in their own attempts to aggregate popular shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lr5ZDG"&gt;On a Roku or Fire TV, my instinct is always to head right for the app where I want to watch something. But with the Chromecast, I’m equally happy browsing through Google’s rows of recommendations. The Google TV software always clearly shows where content is coming from — you can pick which streaming apps get factored into these recs — and it also provides helpful information (like Rotten Tomatoes ratings) at the surface level when you’re hunting for that night’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XINYdJ"&gt;When you actually hit play, you’re punted over to Netflix or Prime Video or HBO Max just like always, but there’s no avoiding that. In terms of app selection, Google’s got all of the main players covered. You can still cast content to the Chromecast from your phone or laptop, and Google Assistant voice searches consistently work well and showcase Google’s accurate voice recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHgD8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the software on a streaming device should look like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKXPL"&gt;Everything about Google TV feels tasteful, from the fonts to the way the background color subtly shifts to match the artwork of whatever content is highlighted. And the universal Watchlist, which lets you put together a list of stuff you’re interested in from various streaming services, is super convenient — especially since you can add to it from the web or your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUEQwj"&gt;But not everything about the Chromecast with Google TV is perfect. The software can slow down from time to time, and some customers have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/07/chromecast-google-tv-data-corrupt-android-cant-load-error/"&gt;encountered significant bugs&lt;/a&gt; that Google has tried to iron out with software updates. More annoyingly, despite the hardware supporting both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, there are still very popular apps like Disney Plus — which delivers both on other platforms — that aren’t doing so on the Chromecast. HBO Max says it does Atmos, but that hasn’t been my experience. Why? Who knows, but these inconsistencies are a mark against Google. And as for the Watchlist, some services like Netflix have already started removing their shows from it. Again, that’s something Google has no control over, but it does lessen the feature’s usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e1vJvx"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With its easy-to-use software, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is the best streaming device for people looking for a good, simple option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z2csvA"&gt;2. Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hOCseD"&gt;The best streaming device for people who want to keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7O9OD"&gt;It’s hard to really complain about a Roku. The company’s streaming devices are about as simple and straightforward as they come. All of your apps are laid out in a big grid, which can make the experience feel a bit siloed — but there’s no beating that ease of use. And Roku has tried to touch up and modernize the home screen a bit with new sections like “Featured Free” to highlight content you can stream without any subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qjIbaE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGj91j"&gt;Despite some occasional spats with content companies, Roku now has pretty much all of the entertainment you could want, including (most recently) HBO Max and Peacock. And the wonderfully neutral universal search remains one of the best aspects of the platform, favoring your existing subscriptions and free-to-stream options over making you pay money to rent or buy. And the company’s Roku Channel has grown into a legitimate streaming app of its own, offering a mix of ad-sponsored movies, TV shows, and live news for those days when you’re burned out on combing through Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVnPjT"&gt;The $50 Streaming Stick Plus remains the best overall pick among Roku’s hardware when you weigh price and performance. It gives you HDR, Dolby Atmos, and speedy performance. The main thing you’ll miss out on is Dolby Vision. If that’s a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, you should look at the $100 Roku Ultra set-top box instead, which also includes an Ethernet port for optional wired connectivity and a helpful remote finder feature. Plus, the Ultra’s remote has customizable shortcut buttons and a headphone jack so you can listen privately to whatever’s on-screen if you’re trying to keep quiet at night. (Other Rokus let you do the latter with the company’s mobile app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IoeY"&gt;If there’s one area where Roku falls flat, it’s probably voice search. Your voice queries for specific shows or movies should work well enough, but Roku lags Amazon and Google when it comes to natural language interactions. (And forget about using your voice to control smart home gadgets or look up entertainment-related facts.) Still, the company is adding other perks to offset that weakness. Late last year, it added support for Apple’s AirPlay, letting you easily send content from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the TV screen. Speaking of Apple…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple TV 4K, the best streaming device user experience, on a table with the Siri remote." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RvuBLV2eYixMw2JxsRp5Rer4NJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19701522/cwelch_200205_3895_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s more pricey than the competition, but the Apple TV 4K offers a top-notch user experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JRXodl"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWJwP1"&gt;The best streaming device overall experience (for a steep price)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="M2y4K0"&gt;The Apple TV 4K is laughably overpriced compared to its competitors, but Apple’s set-top box still has its own set of appealing qualities. The interface is fantastic. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos across a wide variety of services, has all of the important apps checked off, and also gives you add-ons like Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness Plus (if you pay for them) that you won’t find on other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0yQqy"&gt;Apps sometimes have a higher level of polish on Apple TV and are generally better about taking advantage of everything it can do. Another benefit of the Apple TV is privacy — to some extent. Apple itself isn’t obsessed with tracking your viewing data in the same way that a company like Roku is, but the streaming apps can still see what you’re doing. I generally think consumers aren’t particularly averse to sharing their streaming habits, but Apple’s privacy practices might matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUc2Xv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351704"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7S0fB"&gt;Even with AirPlay now on Roku, the Apple TV still wins out for people deeply invested in Apple’s ecosystem. You can use HomePods as its speakers or connect two sets of AirPods for private listening with audio sharing. You can view the feed from HomeKit security cameras or see who is at the door if you have a HomeKit video doorbell. The Apple TV still makes it easy to tap into content on a Mac in your home, and services like Apple Music and iCloud Photo Library are right there in easy reach on the TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0nOC"&gt;But there’s no forgiving the infamous remote, which is cumbersome to use and too easy to lose. And it’s more difficult than ever to recommend that you spend $180 on hardware that’s now several years old. Doing so isn’t &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;; you’ve just got to know why the Apple TV 4K is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Yh1ylb"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQ6Oml67NEpEL1BJiRk4Z7fw5Iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13360395/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K checks off all the boxes for HDR support and costs just $50, making it the best streaming stick for people in Amazon’s ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6ajwme"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mO4Da0"&gt;The best streaming stick if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iAlxyK"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is yet another popular pick in that $50 range of streaming gadgets. The latest model added support for Dolby Vision, which made it the only product to offer everything HDR (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, HDR10) for such little money — until the new Chromecast came along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HanEXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oDfmk8"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K’s software is similar to the Chromecast in that the home screen takes a content-focused approach instead of just throwing a grid of apps at you. Amazon tends to showcase its own Prime Video content more prominently than shows and movies from other services, but the newly revamped software goes a long way in improving the look and feel of the Fire TV. Alexa voice commands with the remote also work reliably, whether you’re saying “open Netflix” or asking to dim the smart lights in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0rvix"&gt;Amazon offers most major streaming apps, but there are some frustrating omissions: Vudu — a good source of Dolby Vision movies — and Peacock are both still absent from the Fire TV platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i6E5A2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351738"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JiAvz9"&gt;There’s also the $120 Fire TV Cube to consider. It essentially doubles as a streaming device and small smart speaker. Rather than make you press and hold a button to speak to Alexa like with the Stick 4K, the Cube takes a hands-free approach and has beamforming mics that respond to “Alexa” prompts just like an Echo speaker would. It also features something Amazon calls Local Voice Control, which allows it to understand more spoken commands without needing help from the cloud. The Fire TV Cube has a more powerful processor than the Fire TV Stick 4K, making it the fastest of the Fire TV bunch, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pssjk4"&gt;When it comes to their streaming capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube are on equal footing. And you could always put the money you save by going with the Stick toward one of those new sphere-shaped Echo Dots, which will sound far better than the Cube’s tinny built-in speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zkClUu"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia’s Shield TV, the best streaming player for home theater experts and gamers, pictured on a table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dEmAuOHlgj4pGSulYPpS4vSMAlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19324253/DSCF4370.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV is a powerful Android TV streaming box that’s popular with home theater enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qJ9DFz"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ktAsFL"&gt;Best streaming device for home theater enthusiasts and gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bTK5Wu"&gt;Home theater enthusiasts, gamers, and people who like to tinker with their streaming devices have loyally stuck with Nvidia’s Shield TV and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. They can serve as excellent players like any of our other picks, but you can also go more advanced and use them for cloud gaming or set up a Plex media library (in the case of the Pro). GeForce Now and Steam Link probably do more to sell gamers on the Shield lineup versus something like Apple Arcade on the Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="useqbH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmo5EB"&gt;The Nvidia Shields currently run Android TV with Google Assistant built in, but it’s expected they’ll eventually get the same Google TV experience that’s on the Chromecast. Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling can eke out some extra detail from the shows and movies you stream, and I’d rate the included remote control (with backlit buttons, even) as the most ergonomic of them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVfT5g"&gt;But like with the Apple TV, the main hurdle here is the price. The Nvidia Shield TV costs $150, so you’re looking at spending $100 more than devices that offer most of the same functionality. You get Ethernet and a very powerful streaming device for the added premium, and you can push the Shield TV farther and make it do more than just about any of its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sophisticated hackers snuck sleeper malware into nearly 30,000 Macs</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="avO70x"&gt;There’s a popular stereotype that Apple’s computers are largely immune to malware. Not only is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/12/21134681/mac-pc-virus-malware-malwarebytes"&gt;is that incorrect&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that sophisticated hacker(s) might have been toying with the idea of a heist or drop nasty enough they’d have needed to cover their tracks. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/new-malware-found-on-30000-macs-has-security-pros-stumped/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, security researchers at Malwarebytes and Red Canary discovered a mysterious piece of malware hiding on nearly 30,000 Macs, one designed to deliver an as-yet-unknown payload, and with a self-destruction mechanism that might remove any trace that it ever existed. They’re calling it Silver Sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQyTEK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://redcanary.com/blog/clipping-silver-sparrows-wings/"&gt;Red Canary’s own blog post&lt;/a&gt; goes into more detail, including how they discovered multiple versions targeting not only Intel, but also newer Macs based on Apple’s own M1 chip — which is quite the thing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;given how new Apple’s M1 computers are&lt;/a&gt; and how few vulnerabilities have been discovered yet. It was &lt;a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x62.html"&gt;literally just one week ago&lt;/a&gt; that Objective-See security researcher Patrick Wardle published a story about the first piece of malware discovered in the wild targeting Apple Silicon, and now we have two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EPGdK"&gt;Thankfully, Silver Sparrow was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;able to cover its tracks before being outed, there’s no indication it was used to do any damage, and Red Canary writes that Apple has already revoked the binaries (which should theoretically keep you from accidentally installing it yourself). But the idea damage could have been done isn’t theoretical: they actually found these strains of malware on Macs in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BeOzBK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Given all of this, Silver Sparrow is uniquely positioned to deliver a potentially impactful payload at a moment’s notice, so we wanted to share everything we know with the broader infosec community sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;— Red Canary (@redcanary) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1362558570601058305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJrIqw"&gt;Researchers warn that Apple’s transition from Intel to its own silicon may make it easy for other bad actors to slip malware through the cracks, too: you can read quotes from several of them &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-m1-malware/"&gt;in this &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AhyRCz"&gt;Apple subpoenaed Valve in November as part of its ongoing litigation with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games, and it’s demanding that Valve provide extensive sales data for more than 400 games, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.346.0.pdf"&gt;new filing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/apple-subpoenas-valve-as-part-of-its-legal-battle-with-epic-valve-fights-back/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSU7P8"&gt;The move comes amid Apple’s ongoing fight over Epic’s efforts to avoid paying iOS App Store fees. Apple argues that Valve’s data is necessary to calculate the size of the market of Epic’s “available distribution channels,” as Epic could theoretically offer its games through Steam in addition to other digital marketplaces. But the data is also immensely valuable in assessing the marketplace for games and apps — a space in which Apple’s iOS App Store continues to compete with Valve’s Steam marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNayho"&gt;Valve contends that Apple’s demands are extraordinary and is contesting the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ClS0x"&gt;In one request, Apple calls on Valve to procure documents that show the company’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="P9LoK1"&gt;(a) total yearly sales of apps and in-app products; (b) annual advertising revenues from Steam; (c) annual sales of external products attributable to Steam; (d) annual revenues from Steam; and (e) annual earnings (whether gross or net) from Steam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="L1Vjcl"&gt;Apple argues that this data is “crucial” to help it determine “the total size of the market for Epic’s available digital distribution channels.” The courts have already asked Samsung to provide “almost identical” information, Apple said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="df5Ni3"&gt;In addition, Apple &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; demands that Valve procure documents that show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6Zp6Fl"&gt;(a) the name of each App on Steam; (b) the date range when the App was available on Steam; and (c) the price of the App and any in-app product available on Steam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GWQb3Z"&gt;Valve argues that the requests are overly broad. According to Valve’s position statement in the filing, “Apple gave Valve a list of 436 video games it says are available on the Epic Game Store and Steam, and (a) demanded Valve identify, from 2015 to the present, every version and all digital content or items for each of these games on Steam, then (b) provide exhaustive information about all of them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWZ132"&gt;The requested information includes dates on sale, price changes, gross revenues for “game version and item, broken down individually,” and Valve’s revenues “related to these versions, content and items.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxB5sP"&gt;Valve argues these demands would “impose an extraordinary burden on Valve to query, process and combine a massive amount of to create the documents Apple seeks” and that it does not keep this data as part of the “ordinary course of business.” (The filing also notes that Apple had reduced its request for data from “all 30,000+ games on Steam over ten years” to “436 games over six years.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrLaX"&gt;Valve also argues that “much of what Apple seeks is sales and pricing information for third party games,” but that the company is taking a “shortcut” by subpoenaing Valve instead of getting the information directly from third-party developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMd1qW"&gt;On Wednesday, Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286998/epic-games-apple-european-comission-antitrust-complaint-app-store-fortnite"&gt;filed a formal antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Apple with the European Commission, arguing that Apple has “not just harmed but completely eliminated competition in app distribution and payment processes.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Magic Keyboard is still $100 off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2WwO3t"&gt;With the right keyboard accessory, you can transform your iPad into a laptop. Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the 11-inch iPad Pro and fourth-generation iPad Air can add a laptop-like experience to either tablet. It includes a set of backlit keys and a trackpad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YprKv7"&gt;At $300, the Magic Keyboard accessory is not cheap, but you can sometimes find it at a much lower price. It is currently going for $199 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Magic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2nd-generation%2F984505060&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LDuKNu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cm7W5h"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new TV for your home, Best Buy has an incredible deal: you can buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728939351250604130" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hisense’s 75-inch 4K LED TV (model H6510G) for only $600&lt;/a&gt;, which is $400 off its usual price of $1,000. The model includes Android TV software built in, four HDMI ports, plus a panel that supports Dolby Vision, HDR 10, and HLG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BUysEF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="As8ore"&gt;Over at Walmart, you can grab a new pair of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-White-Charging-Case-Included%2F245851301%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds for $49&lt;/a&gt; in white. Despite the product being almost three years old, at $49 this is a good alternative for people looking for a decent pair of wireless earbuds without shelling out too much cash. As pointed out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255221/samsung-galaxy-buds-headphones-truly-wireless-review-price-specs-features"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Buds feature a six-hour battery life, a comfortable design, and include better sound isolation compared to Apple’s standard AirPods. The Galaxy Buds also include a company case that supports wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stop your emails from being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHKkuFlkTI9-ornuyWoyTQgbwg8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841883/acastro_190703_1777_pixel_tracking_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmDbQw"&gt;All of those obnoxious marketing emails that crowd your inbox aren’t just pushing a product. They’re also tracking whether you’ve opened the email, when you opened it, and where you were at the time by using software like MailChimp to embed tracking software into the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f75NZ"&gt;How does it work? A single tracking pixel is embedded into the email, usually (but not always) hidden within an image or a link. When the email is opened, code within the pixel sends the info back to the company’s server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYBZIp"&gt;There have been some attempts to restrict the amount of information that can be transmitted this way. For example, since 2014, &lt;a href="https://gmail.googleblog.com/2013/12/images-now-showing.html"&gt;Google has served all images through its own proxy servers&lt;/a&gt;, which could hide your location from at least some tracking applications. And extensions such as &lt;a href="https://uglyemail.com/"&gt;Ugly Email&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelblock/jmpmfcjnflbcoidlgapblgpgbilinlem"&gt;PixelBlock&lt;/a&gt; have been developed to block trackers on Chrome and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6EFgJ"&gt;There is also a simple basic step you can take to avoid trackers: stop your email from automatically loading images since images are where the majority of these pixels hide. You won’t be able to avoid all of the trackers that can hide in your email this way, but you will stop many of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjXsAd"&gt;Here’s how to do it in the major desktop and mobile email apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="91Fgwl"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Gmail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zbqpz9"&gt;Click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to access your settings, and click on “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZEfys0"&gt;In the “General” tab (the first one), scroll down to “Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z0QTtq"&gt;Select “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VeQHzw"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on “Save Changes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="yRek5v"&gt;Note that this will also turn off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282636/amp-gmail-shopping-rsvp-forms-inbox-google-beta"&gt;Gmail’s dynamic email feature&lt;/a&gt;, which makes emails more interactive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading gmail" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rt4n2w6dt0YA29AkQaJs88b8OSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278777/Gmail_settings.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XrhZKY"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Microsoft Outlook (Office 365):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MIRvx9"&gt;Click on “File” &amp;gt; “Options.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="132JwF"&gt;In the “Outlook Options” window, select “Trust Center.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bgp9g6"&gt;Click on the “Trust Center Settings” button. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8dvLox"&gt;Check the boxes labeled “Don’t download pictures automatically in standard HTML messages or RSS items” and “Don’t download pictures in encrypted or signed HTML email messages.” You can make a number of exceptions to the first item if you want by checking the boxes underneath it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Microsoft Outlook " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5oSbMQ9LNmjTkrf0o1boDgulmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278781/outlook_6.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sN1ICl"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Apple Mail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0n9f5S"&gt;Select “Mail” &amp;gt; “Preferences.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A7ND3F"&gt;Click on the “Viewing” tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qwEieV"&gt;Uncheck “Load remote content in messages.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Apple Mail: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3aKO2_n5Ebb00LdepxXPrCAzEn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278801/Apple_Mail_preferences_2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HHDXvZ"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Android Gmail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c5Wulc"&gt;Tap on the three lines in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R8HSTQ"&gt;Scroll down to and select “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KjX4Gw"&gt;Tap on the email account that you want to work with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g1X0ro"&gt;Scroll down to and select “Images.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEYbil"&gt;Tap on “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Android Gmail: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0WEEv9FyZisUtRpDpCK4ZFZ-3Xo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278832/Gmail_a__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Android Gmail: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SIPHfcdjyw0EzWrK6Vq0BMMkdco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278833/Gmail_2__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xbW3d5"&gt;Disable image autoloading in iOS Gmail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eUXclZ"&gt;Open Gmail for iOS, tap the hamburger menu in the upper left, and scroll down to settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dr88Ar"&gt;Tap the account you want to personalize, and tap into “Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xTabJG"&gt;Switch from “Always display external images” to “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lo9CuX"&gt;Note that for those wishing to do this on Gmail’s mobile client, it appears it will only work for personal accounts and not enterprise ones managed through G Suite, for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="M1JF9m"&gt;Disable image autoloading on iOS Mail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MIPm7O"&gt;Tap on “Settings” &amp;gt; “Mail.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8CgUR7"&gt;Find the “Messages” section and toggle off “Load Remote Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading on an iPhone: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8J0Rc6S3VmfrsQIy1rnx9Ne4Fwg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278978/IMG_2A872FA43FDA_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading on an iPhone: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wqH9jGDkO4JBmuzkqV8X-MeiqBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278984/IMG_DFD17EB54AF5_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1Qtvj"&gt;Another option is to use an email client such as &lt;a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks remote images by default; the application allows you to download embedded content on an individual basis or allow pictures from contacts that you trust not to send hidden code in their images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06msoO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 3rd, 2019, 3:47PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include additional information about email clients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbvWNJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 3rd, 2019, 7:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include directions for disabling image autoloading on Gmail for iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Bwbn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 17th, 2021, 5:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instructions for Microsoft Mail have been removed, and a few instructions updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
