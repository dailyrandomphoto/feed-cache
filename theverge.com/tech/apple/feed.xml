    <title>Rep. Ken Buck is the new face of Republican antitrust</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Meet the Republican behind the House’s bipartisan antitrust deal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XvYWU2"&gt;In Congress, pretty much everything moves at a glacial pace. But legislation targeting the market power of large tech companies is picking up an unusual amount of bipartisan momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JNGHV"&gt;After nearly two years of investigations into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, the House Judiciary Committee pushed through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;a package of six bills&lt;/a&gt; last month that would force these companies to unwind anti-competitive mergers and make the data they obtain on users more portable, in an effort to spur greater competition in the market. The package was surprising in its size and scope, but even more surprising — it was bipartisan. Colorado Rep. Ken Buck, the top Republican on the antitrust subcommittee, played a large role in building that coalition, which has put him at the leading edge of Republican tech policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjrWFV"&gt;On June 30th, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; met with Buck in his office on Capitol Hill for a brief interview in between House floor votes. We discussed last month’s markup, the congressman’s relationship with the rest of the Republican caucus, and how he’s “very lonely” up in his office where tech lobbyists purportedly refuse to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm1YJC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfSQyV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your initial reaction to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549025/big-tech-antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google-house-judiciary-jim-jordan"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last month’s markup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XMdxT"&gt;Tired, tired. Twenty-nine hours was a lot of time. I thought there were some really good ideas. And as I said from the beginning, this is a starting point and this is how the legislative process should work. We did an 18-month investigation. We drafted bills. We floated them to members. We filed them. They were available to members. In fact, I sent them to all the Republican members on the committee. And then we moved forward with a process with people who had different ideas. I thought it was a very positive process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKj3Sh"&gt;Some of the ideas were just poison pills that were designed to cause division, but most of the ideas proposed in amendments were really positive, and those bills will change again before they hit the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZG0up"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last year, you authored your “Third Way” report detailing the ways in which you disagreed with the majority’s solutions. Can you describe your evolution from authoring that report to supporting the Democrat-led measures last month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8O6ctc"&gt;The bills we presented take a scalpel to the issues that are necessary. What we’re trying to do is slow the monopolization of these four companies in the marketplace to encourage competition. We required the burden to flip on mergers which would slow down the growth of these companies, but at the same time we talk about portability and other things that would encourage competition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SIKTpk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking back from the investigation and pushing for this effort to be bipartisan, what were those conversations with members like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q7jqc"&gt;My evolution from the very beginning was that the market will take care of this. Throughout the investigation, I saw how these companies are acting. I was very concerned and I realized we need to do something. But we don’t want to have the unintended consequence of shutting down the economy and hurting airlines and banks and all the other sectors that do have competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6BEwL"&gt;I think the bills are consistent with the Third Way report. But I also said, I’m opposed to overturning the American Express case. I pointed out some areas that I thought were bad policy in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOiyGf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We heard from Speaker Pelosi that she supports the measures and wants to move forward. But a couple days later, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said that they need more work. How long do you see this process taking and what needs to get done to prepare these bills for the floor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DfsCd"&gt;We take the ideas from the members in the markup. We work on the bills and probably after the August recess, we send the bills out to members again. And those will be managers’ amendments that will move forward with the floor vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3kDPQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the markup, we saw some California Democrats oppose the bills over privacy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ap7cCW"&gt;And the California Republicans, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umnyaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do you think privacy has a place in these bills?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCgCNO"&gt;Yes. The Section 230 censorship issues are under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The issue of privacy, I think in some areas, is in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The way to encourage privacy is to have competition in the marketplace and allow competitors like DuckDuckGo to say they won’t sell our data and you can choose to use that search engine. Or you can use Google’s search engine, and on page 23 of their user agreement, you can agree to allow them to sell your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwOwsh"&gt;The consumers will demand that privacy be taken into account, and some of them don’t care. Some of them do, but the marketplace will address these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIKOMt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It sounds like you agree that privacy is a competition issue. How do you include language in these bills to implement stronger privacy protections?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFrnbc"&gt;How do you implement that? That’s the problem. You don’t want government coming in and saying this kind of speech is not something that you can sell. There is cybersecurity privacy, where we absolutely want to protect from Russian hackers or whoever’s out there. But there’s also the privacy an individual decides to give up. That’s an individual right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="otQ2Am"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What Big Tech wants is to run the clock”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UaDkDY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve mentioned in the past that these bills are just the first step in taking on Big Tech. Many members of your caucus seem to disagree. I listened to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) try to force Section 230 reforms into these bills. How do you plan to meet these requests from other members as you move forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzRrqC"&gt;Section 230 is another committee and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) is working on that. I think that Jim has a lot of good ideas that I will support, but they just don’t belong in these bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fvgtb"&gt;The Democrats aren’t going to pass these 230 reforms. The Republicans who are opposed to these bills want to add it to the bill so the Dems don’t vote for it. And that’s not going to happen. What Big Tech wants is to run the clock. If they can get to the end of this Congress and if Republicans are in charge who don’t like these bills, these bills will never hit the floor. This is the opportunity to get this passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="888Azg"&gt;Jim has been a hero of mine for years, and I love the guy. We disagree about an issue. I don’t go to motive at all with Jim. I just think he and I see this issue differently. He’s been very respectful of me and in different groups that we’ve talked in and I try to be as respectful as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NONIKO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see these moving forward in the Senate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIotLJ"&gt;The likelihood is that you get most Democrats and some Republicans to get over that 60-vote margin. I think there will be some Republican opposition in the Senate. I actually think the Senate works much better in terms of collegial communication than the House does. They’ll be working through these issues in a healthy way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnEmrz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you’re optimistic we’ll see these bills approved over the next few years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMCMSD"&gt;I’m optimistic, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cAh7b2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m very lonely”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rd5FAT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the lobbying effort been like with these big tech companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hE9Cvp"&gt;I hear secondhand what it’s like. Nobody bothers coming in and talking to me. I’m very lonely. I love interviews like this because the reality is that the Big Tech people know this is not a friendly forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0Rg3V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your take on the court throwing out the Federal Trade Commission’s complaint against Facebook last week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSwtov"&gt;It indicates that there is even greater need for the definition of market than there previously was. The judge said in the opinion that it’s easy to define what the tobacco market is. It’s harder to define what the Facebook market is. And the FTC hasn’t done that. So these bills have a definition in place that would address that very issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWM5UM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your opinion on Lina Khan? She’s already moving forward with an aggressive antitrust agenda as FTC chair, and the conservative commissioners seem to think she’s overreaching.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrZkCx"&gt;The challenge is she doesn’t have a voting record. It’s hard to identify her in any particular group, which is good and bad. I look forward to working with her. I’ve had conversations with her. I think she is supportive of what we’re trying to do here. I have stressed in conversations that it’s essential that the FTC work in a bipartisan manner to reinforce the bipartisanship that’s coming out of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj1pX7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the FTC and the Justice Department will be strong enough to take on these companies without this legislation being passed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="K6B6Ml"&gt;Updating laws that are more than 100 years old is really important. We have to amend the laws to appropriately address this issue. The lightbulb hadn’t even been invented when the Sherman Act was passed in 1888. To think that you can click on a computer screen and get something delivered the next day is completely different. The laws have to be updated in order for law enforcement to be effective. It’s a constitutional issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcYxiq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V489p8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kensington’s StudioCaddy is a home for all your Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rycBrR7aOwJrl9DuitSd79rka5U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69544950/DSCF7728_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The StudioCaddy has USB-A and USB-C charging ports on the side.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwwjSr"&gt;Following the recent release of the StudioDock, an opulent stand that turns the iPad Pro into a mini desktop computer, Kensington is expanding its Apple-focused offerings today with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-StudioCaddy-Wireless-Charging-K59090WW/dp/B094Q4XNG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$179.99 StudioCaddy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an unusual product with a simple goal: it’s meant to be the place where all your Apple devices can live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnRsii"&gt;The StudioCaddy is comprised of two halves that attach magnetically. The first half is a basic metal stand that you can slot a closed MacBook into, and there’s also a rubberized shelf out front designed to hold an iPad. The second half attaches onto the front and includes two Qi wireless chargers, one vertical for an iPhone and one horizontal with a recess that you can put an AirPods case into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OaHm9J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hu7DlM"&gt;You could, of course, use the StudioCaddy with many combinations of Windows ultrabook, Android tablet and phone, and Qi-equipped wireless earbuds. Kensington is focusing on the Apple ecosystem, though — the product’s full name is actually “StudioCaddy with Qi Wireless Charging for Apple Devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXi8ru"&gt;The StudioCaddy feels very well built, and each stand is sturdy enough not to get knocked around a desk. The wireless charging stand also has USB-C and USB-A ports for extra power, providing up to 20W over USB-C — enough to charge an iPad (but not a MacBook Pro) reasonably quickly, or even an Apple Watch if you want to complete the set. That’s useful, although the external AC adapter is a little bulkier than I’d prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcNyZH"&gt;While I’ve found many vertical Qi chargers don’t work with my iPhone 12 Mini, Kensington has included a swappable part that lifts the phone to raise its wireless charging coils to the right level. It’s also recommended for use with smaller phones like the iPhone SE or the 11 Pro, though I found various larger Android devices would also charge just fine with it in place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0k8GSB6lgerRCT9b2dvTboX7sQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22700978/DSCF7727_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The StudioCaddy is designed to hold a MacBook and iPad while wirelessly charging an iPhone and AirPods.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HVa9ll"&gt;The main idea with the StudioCaddy is that you can save a lot of desk space by storing all your Apple devices in the same place. In practice, though, I’m not sure that people would need their iPhone charger to be attached to their laptop. Until recently I almost always used my MacBook Pro in “clamshell” mode on another stand, and I put it out of the way to save space, which the StudioCaddy does well. But I’d rather have the iPhone charging in front of me at my desk so I can see notifications coming in, so the benefit of the all-in-one approach is mostly lost on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh5KY6"&gt;If your desk setup allows it, which mine does not, it could be neat to put the StudioCaddy next to your monitor with your phone facing you and your MacBook in clamshell mode. That’s quite a lot of horizontal space to give up, however. You could also just use the StudioCaddy’s two halves independently of one another, and then you’d be left with a good wireless charger and a good MacBook/iPad stand. But there are lots of other options out there for both of those use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL3UUb"&gt;You know your own desk situation better than I do, and I can recommend the StudioCaddy if you think it’d be a decent fit. It’s a well-made, versatile product that does what it sets out to do, and most people with a lot of Apple devices could probably make good use out of it. It’s not cheap, though, so you’d have to be sure it was a better option for you than replicating all the functionality with separate products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAyPeN"&gt;The StudioCaddy will be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-StudioCaddy-Wireless-Charging-K59090WW/dp/B094Q4XNG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to order&lt;/a&gt; from today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Many Saints of Newark, Foundation, Beckett, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6F3nE015CItdqc1LFXCKEa6d2c=/169x0:1338x779/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541060/michael_gandolfini.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Michael Gandolfini stars as Tony Soprano in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAFfeGRbWLQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7EQHx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; returned to its very weird and funny roots this week and introduced Mandy Patinkin as a — let’s say “unconventional” judge, and it’s as if my favorite character from &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; got a new job. I know everyone is probably maxed out on how many streaming channels they can/want to subscribe to, but &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; is reason enough to at least check out Paramount Plus. And I have no idea what’s going to happen on the next episode of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; but (mild spoiler ahead!) I can’t imagine the two characters who got pruned will stay pruned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2awLf"&gt;This week we finally get a first look at the prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos &lt;/em&gt;and a new look at the new&lt;em&gt; Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt; show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0roKoN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAFfeGRbWLQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qOwkcG"&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PySsLR"&gt;In this prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Gandolfini plays Tony Soprano, the iconic role that won his father James multiple awards. Michael is a young Tony in what &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/many-saints-of-newark-trailer-sopranos-movie-alan-taylor"&gt;director Alan Taylor&lt;/a&gt; says is the story of Dickie Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola)— father of &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;’ Christopher— the man who made Tony into who he became. We get a glimpse of Vera Farmiga as Livia, who looks like she plays the matriarch as ice cold as the late, great Nancy Marchand did. Leslie Odom Jr., Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll, and Ray Liotta also star in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and HBO Max October 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w4sDcb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPT_PNucTWE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="olT7eW"&gt;Beckett&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TVfA1V"&gt;An American tourist vacationing in Greece gets into a car accident, and when he wakes up, he’s embroiled in a conspiracy and people are shooting at him. Mr. Beckett does not appear to have the same skill set as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKaB5dvQ4g&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;Jason Bourne&lt;/a&gt;, however, which will probably make things a bit more difficult as he tries to figure out what the hell is going on and attempts to get to the US Embassy. John David Washington and Alicia Vikander star in &lt;em&gt;Beckett,&lt;/em&gt; which hits Netflix August 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pKjod3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvOAA1U0li8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ncYdoF"&gt;Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1KMEPh"&gt;The second teaser trailer for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; finally gives us a release date for this long-awaited series based on the Isaac Asimov novels. The downfall of the Galactic Empire has been predicted by Hari Seldon (Jared Harris), so it has to build a foundation to preserve mankind’s knowledge. Along with Harris, Lee Pace stars as Brother Day, and Lou Llobell as Gaal Dornick. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; premieres September 24th on Apple TV Plus, with new episodes every Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lplJZ7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXdEeRBh9Zk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KEjKlH"&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="umjdTq"&gt;We got a teaser of the Kevin Smith revival of He-Man’s adventures in June, and now we get the full trailer. It’s not a retelling of the He-Man story, but rather picks up where the original TV show concluded in 1985. Chris Wood, Mark Hamill, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lena Headley, and Mark Hamill (as Skeletor) voice characters in &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe,&lt;/em&gt; which debuts on Netflix July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uUUatE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BSSoD73TSk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fao446"&gt;Jolt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9jN8Qt"&gt;This trailer has Kate Beckinsale kicking things and beating people up but she isn’t a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKHL5PyAPzs&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonyPicturesEntertainment"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;; instead she has a rare disorder that makes her rage out if she doesn’t get regular shock treatments from Stanley Tucci. Naturally she meets a guy who doesn’t freak out at her shocking condition (sorry) and of course he gets killed and the cops think she did it so then she has to do some revenge-kicking. Bobby Cannavale, Jai Courtney, Laverne Cox, and Susan Sarandon also star in &lt;em&gt;Jolt&lt;/em&gt; which comes to Amazon Prime Video July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Researcher finds certain network names can disable Wi-Fi on iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7qweLoqpMkgRNJe-alrQ6FnoMCE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540789/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9xZla"&gt;A security researcher has found that certain Wi-Fi networks with the percent symbol (%) in their names can disable Wi-Fi on iPhones and other iOS devices. Carl Schou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vm_call/status/1411630091038203909?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that if an iPhone comes within range of a network named %secretclub%power, the device won’t be able to use Wi-Fi or any related features, and even after resetting network settings, the bug may continue to render Wi-Fi on the device unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VB7vyX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You can permanently disable any iOS device's WiFI by hosting a public WiFi named %secretclub%power&lt;br&gt;Resetting network settings is not guaranteed to restore functionality.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/infosec?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#infosec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/0day?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#0day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Carl Schou (@vm_call) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vm_call/status/1411630091038203909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aiJve1"&gt;A few weeks ago, Schou and his not-for-profit group, &lt;a href="https://secret.club/"&gt;Secret Club&lt;/a&gt;, which reverse-engineers software for research purposes,&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/"&gt; found that if an iPhone connected&lt;/a&gt; to a network with the SSiD name %p%s%s%s%s%n it would cause a bug in iOS’ networking stack that would disable its Wi-Fi, and system networking features like AirDrop would become unusable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NikSyL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; offered&lt;/a&gt; a possible explanation for the weird bug: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QmbFJV"&gt;the ‘%[character]’ syntax is commonly used in programming languages to format variables into an output string. In C, the ‘%n’ specifier means to save the number of characters written into the format string out to a variable passed to the string format function. The Wi-Fi subsystem probably passes the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) unsanitized to some internal library that is performing string formatting, which in turn causes an arbitrary memory write and buffer overflow. This will lead to memory corruption and the iOS watchdog will kill the process, hence effectively disabling Wi-Fi for the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="az5wDQ"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple to see if it’s working on a fix, and will update if we hear back from them. But as&lt;em&gt; 9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes, the bug can likely be avoided by not connecting to Wi-Fi networks with percent symbols in their names. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music is missing one major thing: a classic iPod to go with it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGh4pkF2WCmY3l5Jly55D9HUqUM=/0x0:5861x3907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540186/DSCF2292.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6Hwop"&gt;Earlier this year, I did something weird: I bought an iPod 5th generation, originally manufactured back in 2006. I got it mostly as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/22/17039896/ipod-diy-upgrade-battery-memory-hack"&gt;fun thing to mod&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve actually been using it on a near-daily basis. The experience has brought me to the conclusion that Apple should bring back the iPod, but updated for the modern age. It should keep the click-wheel of course, but I can’t stop thinking about how good an iPod, designed for the age of music streaming, AirPods, and high-res displays would be. I know that might sound silly, but let me explain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jic8nB"&gt;There are a few reasons why Apple should make a new iPod. For one, it would allow the company to capitalize on some nostalgia for the iPod age that seems to be coming around, based on recent iPod-themed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;web players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/28/20986886/iphone-app-ipod-classic-click-wheel-elvin-hu-developer"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/1/22260540/ipod-mod-portable-spotify-player-click-wheel-project"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgCPcV"&gt;The other, perhaps more obvious reason, is that the iPod is a music-centric device, and Apple literally has a service called Apple Music. The company is currently in love with services revenue, but many of its devices just aren’t that great at playing music. The iPhone makes it difficult to plug in many types of headphones, and Siri interrupts what you’re listening to when you’re asking it to do something simple that doesn’t really warrant an audible response (like turning on HomeKit-powered lights, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0FeZe"&gt;Most of, if not all, of Apple’s devices also can’t play the highest-end lossless files &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;that Apple Music can now deliver&lt;/a&gt; without additional hardware. This means that Apple doesn’t sell something it can point to and say “this is the best Apple Music experience you can get, period.” An iPod could be just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCZSDU"&gt;While Apple Music should be tightly integrated into a modern iPod, it would also be great if it could play music from other services, and if it had a totally Classic mode that just played files synced from a computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqksbh"&gt;Not only would opening the iPod up avoid some terrible optics for a company that’s being scrutinized by the government and competitors (like Spotify) for abusing its role as a platform and service designer, but it would also help avoid some of the weirdness that comes with streaming music. A lot of the times I use my iPod these days are because Apple Music is acting up, forcing me to restart the app because it claims that content is unauthorized, or completely fritzing out when trying to play the lossless music Apple recently introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgVvWG"&gt;(Seriously, is anyone else having this problem? Randomly, but very often, the song I’m trying to listen to will devolve into a flurry of high-pitched, digital-sounding squeals, like I’m listening to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6tFRzt-QvA"&gt;a 100 Gecs song&lt;/a&gt; playing on a Discman that’s being vigorously shaken.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjgX2T"&gt;Of course, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipod-touch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F4%2F22561092%2Fapple-bring-back-ipods-2021-music-services" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;does still sell an iPod&lt;/a&gt;, after all these years: the iPod Touch. Now, don’t get me wrong, the iPod Touch is a very good device, especially for children, and people who just want a non-expensive iOS device. But that’s just the thing — the iPod Touch isn’t a purpose-driven music player, it’s an iPhone without the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGVBSl"&gt;But so what? That just means it can use its headphone jack to listen to tunes from Apple Music, as well as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Prime Music, and anything else, as well as play games, surf the web, read books, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGdvcs"&gt;And that’s the rub for me: the iPod Touch is a good computing device, one that Apple should arguably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/28/18642381/apple-ipod-touch-update-iphone-7-processor"&gt;update more often&lt;/a&gt;, but sometimes the best tool for a job isn’t the one that can do everything. It’s the one that’s designed to do one thing really well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MjcC3m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPod Touch is a good device, but sometimes the best tool isn’t the one that can do everything&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XS8dx"&gt;For example, when I’m listening to music on an iOS device I often find that I’m not actually &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to the music, but scrolling through Twitter with it on in the background. That doesn’t happen with my 2006 iPod. The focus that comes with something that’s not offering you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU"&gt;everything, all of the time&lt;/a&gt;, is the same reason some people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444637/kobo-elipsa-e-reader-giant-screen-price-release-date-stylus"&gt;prefer e-readers&lt;/a&gt; over just reading on a tablet or phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3L4ka"&gt;And, practically speaking, making a dedicated portable music player without a smartphone OS and touchscreen would mean that Apple wasn’t competing as much with Android-powered players from the likes of &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/audio-components/hi-res-audio/p/nwa105-b"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Resolution-Lossless-Bluetooth-Spotify/dp/B07L8P8QDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fiio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8iK0s"&gt;There’s also the matter of hardware — if Apple made a new iPod designed for just listening to music, it wouldn’t have to make it powerful enough to run 3D games or Safari, and could instead put resources to a better DAC and amp (perhaps one that could play Apple Music’s aforementioned 24 bit, 192 kHz lossless files). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgxBsf"&gt;I don’t think that a new iPod would ever reach the dizzying heights of popularity that the older models did. Most people are perfectly content to listen to music on their phones — if they weren’t, Apple probably wouldn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/27/16050420/apple-ipod-nano-shuffle-discontinued"&gt;stopped selling iPods&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. However, Apple’s a big company — it could stand to make a niche, music-focused device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434783/apple-homepod-stock-problems-discontinued-sale"&gt;even if its last one didn’t do so well&lt;/a&gt;. And as an old iPod enthusiast, it coming out with a new one would be literal music to my ears (I had to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USYUkK"&gt;P.S. — I’ve also found the Apple Music experience on the Apple Watch to be pretty mediocre, and I don’t want to take my phone on a run. I’m not saying there’s room for an iPod Shuffle with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522993/apple-siri-on-device-speech-recognition-no-internet-wwdc"&gt;the new offline Siri&lt;/a&gt; instead of VoiceOver, but...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internal Apple survey shows concern about hybrid work model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VJ1sL_BooPYAjFRe2TFOW0P1_DQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534632/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GdAIoV"&gt;An internal survey designed by Apple employees shows respondents want the option to work from home and fear their colleagues may have to leave if the company forces people back to the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEnm38"&gt;In the survey, which was sent out in early June, nearly 90 percent of respondents said they “strongly agree” with the statement “location-flexible working options are a very important issue to me.” A total of 1,749 people answered the question. Employees defined “location-flexible” as the option to work from home indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKJjwy"&gt;The news comes on the heels of Tim Cook’s announcement that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple will be rolling out a new hybrid work model&lt;/a&gt; that will require employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. While the move is a big shift for Apple, which discouraged remote work prior to the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;it’s still too strict for some workers&lt;/a&gt;. They say that without the option to work from home whenever they want, some will be forced to resign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obip8K"&gt;The survey is not scientific — it was sent out in a Slack channel for employees to discuss remote work, and only a tiny fraction of Apple’s 147,000-person workforce likely even knew it existed. But the fact that well over a thousand employees participated in a grassroots survey that wasn’t sanctioned by Apple executives is significant. It hints at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a shift in Apple’s famously hierarchical culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvY73t"&gt;In response to the statement “I am worried that some of my colleagues will have to leave Apple due to LACK of location-flexible work options,” 58.5 percent said they “strongly agree.” A total of 1,743 people answered the question. A smaller portion — 36.7 percent — said they are worried &lt;em&gt;they’ll&lt;/em&gt; have to resign due to the lack of flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSIdpP"&gt;Employees sent the survey results to Cook and Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, on June 14th. They included a video with personal testimonies from 24 Apple workers on why remote working options are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nts8Qm"&gt;Two weeks later, Apple sent out a video &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;doubling down on the hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G19vHQ"&gt;The video irked some employees, who felt executives hadn’t listened to their perspective. Even employees who don’t want to work from home forever say the company needs to consider more flexibility while &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/world/asia/virus-delta-variant-global.html"&gt;the Delta variant continues to surge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4E0oqS"&gt;While Apple is encouraging employees to get vaccinated, it’s not requiring everyone to wear masks in the office, saying instead that “choosing to wear a mask in places where protocols have been lifted is a personal decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsKatx"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly trying a ‘retail flex’ work-from-home program for store employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTS4UOxf8ngm7iYOViexxXAdujA=/0x154:3036x2178/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531620/IMG_20171003_180359.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91L5C2"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a program called “Retail Flex,” which will give its store employees the chance to work from home some weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/apple-to-test-hybrid-work-from-store-and-home-for-retail-staff"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; Mark Gurman. According to the report, the employees would be remotely handling things like tech support and online sales part of the time, and working at the store as usual at other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuXefm"&gt;Having employees who traditionally work in a store transitioning to a remote role, even if it’s only a partial change, is a big shift, likely brought on by the pandemic. It doesn’t seem like Apple is just jumping into it. The company is reportedly starting a pilot program that will last at least six months, with participating employees being paid the same salary, plus some extra for internet and office equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OleH27"&gt;If Apple does end up adopting a model that sees fewer employees working retail, it likely won’t be alone. With the US starting to enter its post-pandemic stage, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/how-coronavirus-pandemic-forever-altered-retail.html"&gt;physical stores will have to contend&lt;/a&gt; with the new habits people have formed of shopping online and doing in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQbKMM"&gt;For its non-retail staff, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;will require at least some office time&lt;/a&gt;, with employees having to return to the office at least three days a week. Some of Apple’s workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;pushed back against having to return to the office&lt;/a&gt;, but the company will reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;still go through&lt;/a&gt; with the hybrid work model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dKmIm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to imagine many retail employees working from home during the iPhone launch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTSWdZ"&gt;There’s an interesting contrast with Apple potentially lowering the number of retail employees it has working at most given times, and the other retail moves it’s been making. Over the past few years, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16296460/apple-self-love-iphonex-iphone8-event"&gt;rebranding some of its stores as “town halls”&lt;/a&gt; where events and classes can take place, and it just recently restored two historic buildings &lt;a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-palazzo-reborn-inside-apples-stunning-new-store-in-via-del-corso-rome/"&gt;in Rome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-tower-theatre-opens-thursday-in-downtown-los-angeles/"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; into decadent stores. Now, with news of this plan, it seems like there could be fewer employees around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipapZ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;does say that Apple’s plan is to scale employee presence with retail demand — it’s hard to imagine many employees scheduling work-from-home weeks during the iPhone launch — but we may be soon see the first steps toward a different, more online-focused Apple Store experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the tvOS 15 beta on Apple TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIyMLvWhtpqhoZXAlkrSFk2uxUs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531553/DSCF3875_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bi79e4"&gt;The next big software update for Apple TV will arrive with tvOS 15. While it won’t become widely available until later this year, users who are part of Apple’s public beta program can now take it for a spin ahead of time. It’s possible and even likely that Apple will continue tinkering with tvOS 15 features ahead of its official launch, but particularly for those looking to test-drive Apple’s forthcoming SharePlay feature, the public beta has officially landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx63fz"&gt;The goodies arriving in tvOS 15 that Apple has disclosed so far are small — you’re not going to notice a massive redesign of the tvOS interface, for example — but they’re not insignificant, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgo0ei"&gt;Though, a warning: once you install tvOS 15 on a newer Apple TV 4K box, there’s no turning back. Uninstalling the beta from your Apple TV device may not be possible with newer models. Resetting an Apple TV HD requires &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/reset-apple-tv-atvbf9db0a52/tvos"&gt;connecting a USB-C cable&lt;/a&gt; to your computer (I’ll describe the process more thoroughly later), which isn’t possible on the Apple TV 4K boxes. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Apple to ask about whether it’s possible to revert back to tvOS 14 on newer Apple TVs and will update this guide if we hear back, but a simple factory reset doesn’t cut it. (This is the case with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22558944/watchos-beta-install-how-to"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt; as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SgbbwS"&gt;WHAT ARE THE NEW FEATURES ON tvOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ebM5qU"&gt;For one, tvOS 15 will bring support for SharePlay to Apple TV, allowing users to stream movies and TV shows with others over FaceTime on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. It’s Apple’s spin on group watch features that have largely been supported by individual services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4gSHm"&gt;There was just a handful of streaming services that Apple confirmed during WWDC would support the tool — Disney Plus, Twitch, Hulu, and Prime Video included — but we’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;likely see wider support&lt;/a&gt; before tvOS officially rolls out later this year, as Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month that the feature will be available to any streaming service that wants to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYXbu7"&gt;Two new rows will appear in the Apple TV app in tvOS 15 as well: For All of You and Shared with You. When enabled, Shared with You will populate content that’s been shared with a user through Messages — for example, if a friend recommends &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lisey’s Story&lt;/em&gt; from Apple TV Plus. (Though you’ll need to enable it using another Apple device, and I couldn’t seem to set it up this way.) For All of You, meanwhile, will surface content that Apple believes would be a good fit for everyone in the household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuXTVz"&gt;Some additional features coming to Apple TV in tvOS 15 include support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max as well as on-screen connectivity notifications for AirPods. Additionally, HomeKit will allow users to view multiple camera feeds at once. And lastly, the update will support pairing two HomePod mini speakers to an Apple TV 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKaZG3"&gt;WHAT DEVICES ARE SUPPORTED FOR tvOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W1o1cA"&gt;Apple TV 4K (2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bkDwMg"&gt;Apple TV 4K (2017)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kaLnAz"&gt;Apple TV HD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hMkR9v"&gt;HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE tvOS 15 BETA&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the settings menu, toggle on “Get Public Beta Updates.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vx0KXZ"&gt;On your computer, sign up for &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta program&lt;/a&gt;, or sign in if you’re an existing member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rFbzTY"&gt;Once you’re signed in, navigate to the tvOS tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UM82hE"&gt;Scroll down to the “Get Started” section of the tvOS beta page and &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/enroll#tvos"&gt;enroll your Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pCtpwq"&gt;Now head for the settings menu on your Apple TV and select “Users and Accounts.” Make sure you’re signed in with the same Apple ID you used to register for the beta program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uDuuym"&gt;From the settings menu, select “System” &amp;gt; “Software Update,” and toggle on “Get Public Beta Updates”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AjrqKU"&gt;Once this setting is enabled, update your Apple TV from your system settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6KSLzZ"&gt;How to restore your Apple TV HD to its factory settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Pq3lqu"&gt;If the beta isn’t working for you, you can &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/reset-apple-tv-atvbf9db0a52/tvos"&gt;restore an Apple TV HD&lt;/a&gt; (but again, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the Apple TV 4K) to its factory settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jPNroI"&gt;Disconnect both the HDMI and power cables from the box, then connect it to your computer using a USB-C cable. Apple suggests connecting it to a Mac running macOS Catalina or later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0XLP6g"&gt;Open Finder from your computer, and choose “Restore” from the Apple TV menu &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Dn6Uc8"&gt;If you’re attempting to reset your box with a PC, you’ll need to use iTunes to restore the Apple box from the Source list. The same goes for Macs running Mojave or older.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 15’s new Live Text feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Grz1iv2Q-EqgdejaZyXhstVLLIM=/311x0:2249x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531103/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_3.24.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xDK9Nx"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;now available in public beta&lt;/a&gt;, which means that today you can try out all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;biggest features coming to the iPhone&lt;/a&gt; this fall. That includes Live Text, the most technically impressive feature in the update, which allows you to pull text, email addresses, phone numbers, and more from pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJ8tcg"&gt;Live Text works with both handwritten and typed text, and supports English, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Portuguese, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. It’s also important to remember that iOS 15 is still in beta, which means that Apple could tweak or change how Live Text works in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpYxEg"&gt;Live Text works in a few different ways on iOS, depending on what you’re trying to use it for and where in the OS you are. Here are all the different ways you can use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYeuj4"&gt;With text fields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_-4CyMdFNBnctjnp2raX6GOmuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694122/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new “Text from Camera” option in the text select menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SKoALRc81vn5sgQ2uh0tGV3l7Ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694125/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Live Text works when importing text directly into a messaging field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pwjojp"&gt;The most powerful — and useful — way to use Live Text is with virtually any text field on iOS. Whether you’re writing a text message to a friend, an email, or something in the notes app, you can add text that you copied from an image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WegPR2"&gt;Once you’ve got the text you want (see below), tapping on the text field (as you would when accessing the pop-up select / copy / paste menu that’s been on iOS for years) brings up an additional option: text from camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXuh82"&gt;Tapping that new button will bring up a smaller camera window, which you can point at any block of text. iOS will then highlight the block of text it’s selecting, and you can drop it in just by hitting the “insert” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SY7pXg"&gt;(You might want to proofread things, of course, before you send or post it — Live Text is pretty good, but its not perfect, especially when working with handwritten text.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qX2cWjC_E_3p4yiYCYuyQqOCqV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694093/IMG_2826.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text pulling text from the camera app’s live preview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6TmP4cBBPKSaemzq6soNwG4k3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694094/IMG_2825.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text in the Photos app, pulling handwritten text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Db9ALA"&gt;In the camera app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PVkw3d"&gt;If you have an iPhone XS or newer, you can also use Live Text directly in the camera app in real time. Just open the camera app and tap the live text button that appears in the corner of the viewfinder (it’ll pop up contextually when you’re pointing it at text) to grab text that you can then copy and paste. You can also interact with it directly in the case of phone numbers, email addresses, and links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2RbLOQ"&gt;In Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tRNnpQ"&gt;If you’re viewing any pictures with text in them in the Photos app, you can select and interact with text there. It works just like selecting actual text anywhere else on iOS: tap and hold on the text in an image and you’ll see the familiar-looking blue highlights pop up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g-kF4ZNrLZ53OdaTJ_stZRdbRmE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694096/IMG_2827.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text’s “Show Text” option in Safari on iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-bVwPQgkk47K66Xw4fIh44mL0is=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694100/IMG_2824.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text pulling text from a screenshot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZiGX9k"&gt;In Safari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hhf0VN"&gt;Text can also be selected directly from images on the web in Safari. To grab text, tap and hold on an image, and hit the “Show Text” button, which will allow you to highlight and interact with text here.&lt;/p&gt;
