    <title>Apple Watch flags multiple types of irregular heartbeats, study shows  </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="btdYqJ"&gt;People who get irregular pulse notifications on an Apple Watch but don’t have atrial fibrillation — the condition the feature focuses on detecting — could still have another type of problem with their heartbeat, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIRCEP.121.010063"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwctQo"&gt;The findings show that even if someone with a concerning alert from their Apple Watch doesn’t get an atrial fibrillation diagnosis, they may not be in the clear, says study author Marco Perez, the director of the Inherited Arrhythmia Clinic at Stanford University Medical Center. “Even if you didn’t find atrial fibrillation, we were finding a lot of people who had something else that probably needed some clinical attention,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIkRfb"&gt;The analysis, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;, was done using data from the Apple Heart Study, which was designed to test the Apple Watch’s ability to detect irregular heart rhythms. It launched in 2017 and included over 400,000 participants. In the study, anyone who got an irregular pulse notification from the watch was sent a clinical ECG patch, which could monitor their heart rhythm over a longer period of time. About 2,000 participants got an irregular pulse notification, and an earlier analysis showed that around &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1901183"&gt;a third of those people&lt;/a&gt; who then wore an ECG patch had atrial fibrillation show up during that monitoring period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpZsC6"&gt;This new study looked at the ECG patch data from the remaining participants that &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; have atrial fibrillation detected. “If we didn’t find atrial fibrillation — what did we find?” Perez says. Around 40 percent of those people had some other type of irregular pulse, including premature atrial contractions (extra heartbeats coming from the top of the heart) and premature ventricular contractions (extra heartbeats from the bottom of the heart). “They had a lot of these extra heartbeats,” he says. “Those are things that we pay attention to.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apUjzJ"&gt;Cardiologists still don’t have a good grasp on how dangerous those types of frequent extra heartbeats can be, and often don’t agree on how or if they should be treated, Perez says. They’ve been linked to the development of atrial fibrillation and heart failure, but there isn’t a clear understanding of the best way to manage them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWmqT4"&gt;The study also showed that almost a third of study participants who did not have atrial fibrillation detected on the ECG patch said that they eventually went on to get the condition diagnosed outside of the study. So even if someone doesn’t get a diagnosis on an initial evaluation, it may make sense to keep an eye on them going forward. “We probably have to start thinking about the best strategy for following those patients over time,” Perez says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a63Ifo"&gt;Right now, there’s a wide range of responses to these types of alerts. If someone tells a cardiologist that they had an irregular pulse notification, the doctor might do a quick, 10-second check on an ECG in the office. Other doctors might send them home with a patch for a week. Still others, if there are other factors that make them suspicious, might want to do longer-term monitoring. The technology is still new and the approach is still evolving, Perez says.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsmnP9"&gt;Additional research will help refine the approach. But for now, this study implies that people who get irregular pulse warnings should keep an eye on their heart health, Perez says. “There might very well be something that is going on that could cause you to have an irregular pulse, and could be a sign of something wrong with your heart.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KY8K5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmhRf8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Backbone releases free adapter and 3D-print files for iPhone 13 Pro camera bump issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pTzJYYDGcJV2im_LTmgwbvwrlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913581/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hk174V"&gt;Backbone Labs has acknowledged the issue that hampers the use of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;excellent iPhone gaming controller&lt;/a&gt; with the new iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691301/iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-backbone-one-gaming-controller-accessory"&gt;As we noticed last week&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone 13 Pro’s thicker camera bump means the phone doesn’t sit neatly in the Backbone One controller, either sticking out on one side or causing the bridge on the back to slightly buckle. It’s not unusable, but it’s not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV1mXY"&gt;“We spent a tremendous amount of time meticulously crafting every surface of Backbone One (both bits and atoms) and even designing universal support for the iPhones available when it was released,” a Backbone representative wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Backbone/comments/pvhl98/backbone_one_iphone_13_pro_pro_max_adapter/"&gt;official post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we’re disappointed in the situation at hand. Several folks on the team even upgraded to 13 Pro Max for a better gaming experience, and while the fit may be acceptable for some users, it’s not as good as we’d like it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WquSRF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0nAvVr"&gt;To address this, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2Fadapter%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22695887%2Fbackbone-controller-iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-3d-printed-adapter" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Backbone has designed an adapter&lt;/a&gt; that is intended to improve the experience with the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. Ordering one will require the latest version of the Backbone app. Once you boot into it, you should see a pop-up that will guide you through the process of ordering one. Otherwise, you can open the app, then go to Settings, find the Help button, then click “Request Adapter.” It’s free to order, but you’ll pay shipping fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZFzsm"&gt;Backbone has also released open-source 3D printable files for the adapter, if you’d prefer to go that route. &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4977709"&gt;The files are hosted on Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;. It says on its site that “UPS offers printing services, there are tons of free local printers at libraries, and websites like Shapeways allow you to order prints to your doorstep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwUaUy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 30th, 8:42AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Backbone has added a support page that details the installation process for the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max adapter. Additionally, it has steps for Backbone One owners, both current and new, to redeem a free adapter or 3D print it themselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find your lost iPhone — even if it’s off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxmdXDJ2xj6wpidTTrR5CzNWgyg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925408/vpavic_4547_20210421_0021.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJ0xk1"&gt;Apple’s Find My app has been a very useful (and reassuring) feature, allowing you to locate a misplaced (or stolen) phone so that you can retrieve it (or contact the authorities, if that’s safer). With the expansion of Find My to a variety of other objects, especially via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, it’s become even more useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMV5J8"&gt;And now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; brings with it the capability to locate your phone even if the battery has run out or it’s been turned off — if you’ve got the right phone — the utility of Find My has become even greater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECF20O"&gt;You will be able to locate a shut-off phone if you have the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hdzDEF"&gt;iPhone 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="83xhGf"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro / iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oFLhI1"&gt;iPhone 12 / iPhone 12 Mini&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XJvpcX"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro / iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EgrF78"&gt;iPhone 13 / iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BlZysq"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro / iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0gkbP2"&gt;You’ll know that this feature is active if, when you shut your phone down, you see the phrase “iPhone Findable After Power Off” under the power-down toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hv0yZ6"&gt;Activate the Find My app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="czJIfR"&gt;If you’re new to the iPhone or have never set up the Find My app yet, here’s how you start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zIfTal"&gt;Go to your settings, tap on your name, and then on “Find My.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LuzA3e"&gt;Tap on “Find My iPhone.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mIyfi6"&gt;Toggle “Find My iPhone” on. If you have upgraded to iOS 15, you can also activate “Find My network,” which will let you find your phone even if it’s offline. “Send Last Location” will send the location of your iPhone to your Apple account when the battery is about to die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turn on the Find My feature in your settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hEyLTj__UBAbTD4HpxYhdYbZFn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884575/IMG_49615EE7ED8B_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn on the Find My feature in your settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turn on “Find My network” to find your phone when it’s off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RNDYVuILGJl6ncQVRmWvCChpZxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884577/IMG_E77E43DD93EA_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn on “Find My network” to find your phone when it’s off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IAs1td"&gt;And that’s it! After that, if you can’t find your iPhone, then you can track it either by using the Find My app on a Mac (or another iPhone, if you have one) or on any browser by going to &lt;a href="http://iCloud.com/find"&gt;iCloud.com/find&lt;/a&gt; and signing in using your Apple ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WCkuy"&gt;If you’re using the web version, then you’ll see a green dot that locates your iPhone. Select the dot and then the circled “i” (for information), and you’ll be given the choice of having your phone play a sound, erasing it, or putting it on “Lost Mode.” In “Lost Mode,” you can enter a phone number where you can be reached and a message (“Please return this phone asap!”). After that, the phone will be locked until you reenter its passcode.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Find My app lets you locate your phone, send a notification, or erase it. (Note: the map has been blurred for privacy reasons.)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DtyCr1Ryk_qdHRUm_kBoMOlC5oE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884619/Screen_Shot_2021_09_28_at_10.10.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Find My app lets you locate your phone, send a notification, or erase it. (Note: the map has been blurred for privacy reasons.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XMD6QL"&gt;If you’re using the Find My app, you’ll get basically the same features (except in a more aesthetically pleasing form), along with map directions on how to get to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTXF7S"&gt;And yes — if you’re using iOS 15 on your iPhone, you will be able to locate it even if it’s run out of battery power or has been shut off. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Find My can locate a phone even if it’s off — as long as it has iOS 15 installed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Gh52_nYw0SlvCzEQB_hNMpsde4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884670/Screen_Shot_2021_09_27_at_4.50.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My can locate a phone even if it’s off — as long as it has iOS 15 installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SZblTv"&gt;(Note: you can also use the Find My app to help with your own security — to share your location with individuals and send recurring notifications of when you leave and arrive. You can find directions for setting that up in our article “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676312/ios-iphone-apple-location-tracking-turn-off-on"&gt;How to use iPhone’s location tracking&lt;/a&gt;.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPzGxS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 29th, 2021, 3:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add information on which iPhones can be found after power off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can finally rate Apple’s apps on the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucAA2Huwjoixhj4Wik797kZ8HK0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69927350/acastro_210831_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mzwh7q"&gt;For years, Apple has let you redownload many built-in apps from the App Store that you may have deleted, but store listings for those apps had a distinct difference from others: there was no way to leave a rating or review. That appears to have changed recently, though, as you can now review Apple’s apps in the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Q3gr"&gt;In a cursory, unscientific scan of some of Apple’s apps, many of them don’t have overwhelmingly positive scores. Files, Apple Maps, and Home all had ratings between three and three-and-a-half stars. Apple News is currently sitting at 2.3 stars. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/rate-and-review-apple-iphone-built-in-apps/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; observed&lt;/a&gt;, Podcasts has a whopping two-star rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fnx7HA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There aren’t a lot of ratings yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qWZKo6"&gt;That said, most of Apple’s apps just don’t have many ratings — many don’t break triple digits — meaning the current reviews represent an infinitesimally small sample of the huge number of iOS users who are out there. (To give you a sense of just how large the iOS ecosystem is, Apple said in January that there were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021"&gt;more than a billion iPhones in active use&lt;/a&gt;.) It also means that Apple’s apps have far fewer ratings than well-known apps like Gmail (347K), Facebook (1.1 million), and TikTok (10 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luPjyO"&gt;But even if there are only a few ratings right now, I still think the change is a good one, and I’m curious to see how ratings shake out for Apple’s apps over time. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to start drafting my review of Apple Mail where I publicly beg for a built-in snooze function.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can charge your iPhone 13 Pro Max much faster with the right power brick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OnfHZ51hQMWJc91fwiQdne0eQIE=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69927111/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="text-container"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro Max can charge a bit faster than other models, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byIt3SmVfyg"&gt;according to tests done by YouTuber ChargerLAB&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1441706758607552518"&gt;backed up&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/785/785771.htm"&gt;other tests&lt;/a&gt;), which show that the phone sips up to 27 watts of power when plugged into a compatible charging brick. If you have a 13 Pro Max and want to fill up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;massive battery&lt;/a&gt; as fast as possible, you may want to look into getting a 30W charger that, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205"&gt;tests cited by @duanrui1205&lt;/a&gt;, can charge it from zero to full in less than 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__aifbjt1xnnj"&gt;This appears to be an upgrade from the previous generation — &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/02/what-can-i-use-to-charge-iphone-12/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 12 caps out at around 22W charging speeds. That’s about a 5W boost, which is nothing to sneeze at. The benefit of a bigger charger is limited to the Pro Max, according to @duanrui1205, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1442424092238352396?s=20"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt; that the smaller iPhone 13 Pro could only charge at 20W. All of this goes out the window if you’re charging wirelessly or with Apple’s MagSafe puck — you’ll&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"&gt; be limited to 15W at most&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyzvo0"&gt;If you’re looking for a 30W brick to charge your Pro Max a bit faster, it’s probably worth looking around your house first: Apple includes 30W chargers with its new MacBook Air, and the 61W charger that comes with MacBook Pros could also provide the 27 watts your phone craves. You can check any other chargers in your house by reading the regulatory text that’s usually printed near the prongs — if it doesn’t outright say the wattage, you can figure it out by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#Overview"&gt;multiplying the amps and voltage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nMrhUB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10780536"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ADsxCo"&gt;If your search for a 30W charger didn’t turn up anything, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMY1W2AM%2FA%2F30w-usb-c-power-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F29%2F22700491%2Fiphone-13-pro-max-faster-charge-times-27w-charging-brick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple will happily sell you one&lt;/a&gt;. You can also find plenty of third-party ones, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Adapter-Compact-Foldable/dp/B091DS2M8X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s tiny Nano II GaN brick&lt;/a&gt;. One thing to note when looking at chargers is the charge rates they support — to get the 27W charging, the iPhone is looking for 9V at three amps, according to ChargerLAB’s video (which shows one 30W charger &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/byIt3SmVfyg?t=309"&gt;that’s only charging the iPhone at 18W&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 ‘unlock with Apple Watch’ bug fixed in iOS beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The buttons are unchanged on the Apple Watch Series 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v2L1cr9xo_3HsyPQNPHTY9v9Cs8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924432/vpavic_200929_4216_0111.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cYRrZl"&gt;Apple has reportedly fixed the issue that broke the “unlock with Apple Watch” feature on iPhone 13 models. The feature, which lets Apple Watch users unlock their iPhones without a password when wearing a mask, now works again as of the second iOS 15.1 beta, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/28/ios-15-1-beta-2-fixes-unlock-with-apple-watch-bug-for-iphone-13-users/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yH0EIC"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22694679/apple-fix-issue-unlock-apple-watch-feature-iphone-13"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; on its support page a few days ago that it was working on this problem. I’ve run into the issue myself on my personal iPhone 13 Pro and can confirm that it’s been pretty annoying after having gotten used to the feature since it was introduced earlier this year. Newer iPhones don’t have fingerprint readers, so the only way to unlock them when your mask interferes with Face ID is by using a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ftf1oh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 is here, but we’re still waiting on a few new features","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PWIhrY"&gt;There’s no word on when iOS 15.1 will be released to the public, but it’ll likely contain more than just this fix. SharePlay, one of the most vaunted new additions to the OS back when it was announced at WWDC in June, missed the original iOS 15 release but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686897/ios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card"&gt;appeared in the first 15.1 beta&lt;/a&gt;. The feature lets you share music and video content over a FaceTime call. iOS 15.1 also looks set to allow you to add proof of vaccination status to the Wallet app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says the iPad Mini’s jelly scrolling isn’t a problem that needs to be fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WEGUNYfPxzjse8L3u8t9hvwNPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922596/vpavic_210924_4766_0047.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NhqQno"&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/2021-ipad-mini-suffers-from-uneven-jelly-scrolling-in-portrait-mode/"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it thinks the “jelly scroll” effect some users have noticed on the new iPad Mini is normal LCD behavior that the company won’t have to fix. The effect, also known as skewing, can make it seem like one half of the display is slightly behind the other while you're scrolling, and it’s most apparent while using the iPad Mini in portrait mode. &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn noted the issue in a tweet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt; of the device published this morning. Despite our requests before and after publishing the review, the company did not respond or comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cFw9a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; explains that the issue happens because the iPad starts drawing the lines on one side of the screen, and it takes time to go from one side to the other. A tiny amount of time, yes, but it can be noticeable depending on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3bKrD"&gt;You can see what it looks like below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="91zdci"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is is slow-mo video of scrolling on the iPad Min i slowed down EVEN MORE in a frame-by-frame step through. Notice how the right moves up faster than the left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In normal usage you barely see it, but every now and then it become noticeable. In landscape it goes away entirely &lt;a href="https://t.co/iq9LGJzsDI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iq9LGJzsDI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1440678843589689346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmPztH"&gt;If you want to see how LCD screens refresh in shocking detail, The Slow Mo Guys on YouTube &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3BJU2drrtCM?t=250"&gt;have done a video&lt;/a&gt; showing how it works with TVs and iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CW2ggO"&gt;Apple is correct in stating this effect is common in LCD displays. It’s very possible that the screen you’re reading this on right now would display the same effect if you &lt;a href="https://www.testufo.com/scanskew"&gt;loaded up a webpage that tests for it&lt;/a&gt; — my laptop shows it quite strongly. The reason it sticks out on the iPad Mini, though, is that it’s frequently used in alignments where the problem is most apparent — it’s not likely to be an issue on a landscape display where you’re scrolling vertically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCjgTe"&gt;This effect also happens with many video cameras, for largely the same reasons: if you pan fast enough, straight items like poles and trees will slant to one side, as the data is read from the top of the camera’s sensor to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lRD3l"&gt;While the effect is common (and subtle on the iPad Mini, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;we don’t think it’s a deal-breaker&lt;/a&gt; given how good the screen is otherwise and the inclusion of USB-C), it seems noticeably worse on this particular model than other recent iPads. It also feels unusual that Apple isn’t concerned about it while managing to avoid jelly scrolling on both higher-end iPad models and even my previous-generation iPad Mini (which retailed for significantly less than the new model). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPad Mini 2021 review: a little different</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The middle child of the iOS lineup&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="61X6W8"&gt;The complete redesign of the $499 2021 iPad Mini has a lot of people taking a second look at it — myself included. The allure of a smaller iPad appeals to more than just the pilots and doctors Apple cites as popular users. It appeals to me. The iPad Mini occupies a middle space between the phone and full-size iPads, which turns out to be exactly what I’m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62espm"&gt;It’s tempting to think of the iPad Mini as just a smaller iPad, or as just a bigger iPhone. It is both of those things and yet neither. It’s the middle child of Apple’s iOS lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="32h5Fw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10776922"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3p-vKHrb6XdcJ31r3kexPmlDOXI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883440/vpavic_210924_4766_0022_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini works with the second-generation Apple Pencil, which charges by sticking to the side of the iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QyjtPg"&gt;The iPad Mini has been redesigned to match the look and feel of the iPad Pros and iPad Air. That means it has flat sides and more squared-off edges, but more importantly it means that the screen is larger, going closer to the edge and filling out the device at 8.3-inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91C4SL"&gt;Apple also updated the processor to the top-of-the-line A15 Bionic — though I suspect the main reason for that is so that it won’t need to give it a spec bump for a few years. 5G also comes along for the ride, but not the ultra-fast mmWave flavor (no big loss there, given how rare mmWave really is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drPaPn"&gt;But the star of the show is the bigger screen. It’s surrounded by smaller, even bezels all around the front of the device. I do wish they were a little smaller, but I think doing that would significantly add to the cost of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz33yw"&gt;Given that the base model is already 500 bucks for a mere 64GB of storage, I prefer the tradeoff Apple made. The only other storage option is 256GB, which runs $649 (5G versions cost more still).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8UBYc"&gt;The screen also isn’t quite up to the quality you’ll get on the iPad Pro models. It’s high-enough resolution, but when scrolling in portrait mode I can see just a little bit of a jelly effect, where one side moves ever-so-slightly faster than the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMpRAr"&gt;It’s a common thing on a lot of screens, you can test it on your own screen at &lt;a href="https://www.testufo.com/scanskew"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;. It’s usually not noticeable because it often happens vertically instead of horizontally. When I use the iPad Mini in landscape, I can’t see it. I don’t think it’s a big problem, but it’s there. I’ve asked Apple for comment and will update if there’s a reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPEZiD"&gt;If I had an actual gripe about the screen, it would be that it doesn’t get bright enough to comfortably use outdoors in bright sunlight. But the truth is I don’t have any real complaints — I love having the slightly bigger screen than prior Minis and it looks nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNxPMBfksjIU9H1070teRLjzCx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882360/vpavic_210924_4766_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad Mini has a single rear camera, like the iPad Air.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FZfgJh"&gt;The rest of the redesign is what you’d expect. It supports the second-generation Apple Pencil, which can attach and charge magnetically to the side of the Mini. Apple had to move the volume buttons over to a different spot to accommodate that. It also improved the cameras — the front facing one now supports the Center Stage feature which tracks you and keeps your face centered during video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxTQFR"&gt;Battery life is okay but not amazing. Unless I’m using a big iPad as my all-day work computer, it seems like it can last a week between charging. The Mini isn’t quite that good. It’s pushing it to get a full day of constant use, but lighter use does get me through a couple of days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVHrr3p0267UGeehmUinTHtJdgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882366/vpavic_210924_4766_0061.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple ditched the home button this generation, so the Touch ID sensor is located in the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8smglyVlw43AQk9JSP9yqCmy5G0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882364/vpavic_210924_4766_0043.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The squared off sides bring the Mini in line with the iPad Pro and iPad Air’s designs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2SFNR"&gt;You unlock the iPad mini by resting your finger on the Touch ID sensor on the power button, just like the iPad Air. The speakers are nice and loud. It uses USB-C like a modern device should and therefore is compatible with a wider array of accessories than iOS devices that use the Lightning port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHRnEK"&gt;It also lacks a headphone jack, which is unsurprising but I think worth bringing up here because it could keep some people from buying this device to hand off to a kid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpETYF"&gt;Speaking of things that everybody just seems to have accepted but is actually a genuine problem that deserves continued pressure: support for multiple users. Apple continues to refuse to allow iPads to support multiple user accounts (outside of specific education settings, anyway). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xX0Ww2"&gt;I still find it punitive — not every family can afford (or wants) to buy an iPad for every person in the household and sharing a device can be a real hassle. Tablets that run Android, Amazon Fire OS, Windows, and even Chrome OS support multiple user profiles. The fact that the otherwise best line of tablets out there does not is flat out ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYDatO"&gt;The other iPadOS concern with the iPad Mini is that Apple doesn’t seem to have fully thought through what it means for it to be running on a smaller display. There are places where some buttons or text are cut off. In landscape mode, the keyboard is almost comically large and hides too much of what you’re trying to look at. And all too often buttons and icons end up being so tiny that — as &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/jobs-7-tablets-should-come-with-sandpaper-so-users-can-file-down-their-fingers"&gt;Steve Jobs once joked&lt;/a&gt; — you sometimes feel like you need to sand your fingers down to tap them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_eGxB260KXMqNs9WmLxtaqUsWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882365/vpavic_210924_4766_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad Mini can be comfortably held for a long time — like when you’re reading a book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yAQeU5"&gt;That was a lot of complaints. But despite all of them I dearly love the iPad Mini and have gone so far as to replace my iPad Pro with one. If anybody asked me if they should do the same I would be loathe to say yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNuqc2"&gt;Instead, I would respond with another question: do you know exactly why you want to have a smaller iPad instead of a big phone or a full-size iPad? Because the iPad Mini is not very good at the things those are good at, and it’s only really better than those things in a few specific ways. I just happen to care a lot about one of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvnPq5"&gt;There are specific niche use cases for an iPad Mini. If you do computing work in the field and need something more portable, the iPad Mini makes a ton of sense — maybe more so now that it works with USB-C accessories. Apple’s marketing around pilots using it isn’t fluff, either — it’s a genuinely useful and much used device in small aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7Wl43"&gt;But the iPad Mini is worse than larger iPads for a lot of the things people want to use iPads for. The screen is smaller for videos and too cramped for multitasking when you’re doing a lot of work. It’s more expensive than the base $329 iPad (also recently refreshed with better specs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5fe7j"&gt;It doesn’t have a smart connector for keyboards, which means you’re on your own to find a Bluetooth keyboard that you like. (As an aside: why are all portable Bluetooth keyboards so terrible? Somebody please make something better than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Fkeys-to-go.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22696652%2Fipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XMM1XJV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FFVVDJ8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ugh&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7O4guI"&gt;For me, what the iPad Mini is best at is as an evening device, the thing I putter around the house with instead of my phone. I don’t just mean that it’s a “content consumption” device, either — though of course that’s a big part of it. I can do some work on this thing, but it’s constraining enough that I do less of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cdM6iTHJ17tEVxmHM1RmYf16iIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882359/vpavic_210924_4766_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Apple iPad Mini&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="B5UNyg"&gt;I like the iPad Mini because it can do all the multitasking tricks a big iPad can do, but most of the time I end up using it like a giant phone. I like it better than a giant phone because the screen is even bigger still than that device. (Though why Apple doesn’t add some sort of split-screen to the iPhone Pro Max phones is beyond me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXgk0m"&gt;Most of all, I like the iPad Mini because its physical size changes my relationship with the content I’m engaging with on the screen and — most importantly — with what’s happening around me. I physically can hold it further away from my eyes, which as a human body in the real world opens me up more than a phone does. I’m not hunched over in a one-on-one with a screen nor am I fully immersed in something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TQE6Z"&gt;It’s in between, and as such it means I’m simply more approachable to the people around me to talk, to look up, to stand up and wander over to the kitchen. Like the Galaxy Z Fold, it’s a device that requires more intentionality to use than a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="fRgBWB"&gt;The iPad Mini is not just a small iPad. Even though the change in screen size doesn’t change how the software works (to its detriment), it does change how you use the software. That’s why it’s great for me — and it’s why my advice to anybody considering one is to think about whether or not it would truly be great for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boPWF3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ex-Apple designer Jony Ive is now designing expensive things for Ferrari, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple CEO Tim Cook Delivers Keynote At Annual Worldwide Developers Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unbyAtUbdpgDErIUr2vAsZrqs1c=/0x0:4692x3128/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916598/1153510444.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2e3eIe"&gt;LoveFrom, the design firm headed by Jony Ive and Marc Newson, &lt;a href="https://www.exor.com/press-releases/2021-09-27/exor-ferrari-and-lovefrom-announce-creative-partnership"&gt;has entered into a creative partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Ferrari and Ferrari’s holding company Exor to design presumably automotive-related projects and explore “the business of luxury” (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-27/ferrari-exor-partner-with-ex-apple-design-chief-jony-ive-s-firm?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). LoveFrom’s output has remained somewhat unknown &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761736/jony-ive-apple-leave-iphone-chief-design-officer-lovefrom-company-quit"&gt;since Ive left Apple to start the design firm in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and Ferrari marks just the second high-profile partnership for the company following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527824/apple-designer-jony-ive-airbnb-hired-lovefrom"&gt;a separate deal with Airbnb last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJuxlb"&gt;Details on what LoveFrom is actually doing for the luxury carmaker or Exor are slim. “The first expression of this new partnership will bring together Ferrari’s legendary performance and excellence with LoveFrom’s unrivalled experience and creativity that has defined extraordinary world changing products,” Exor writes, without explaining what the companies will do together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yDUwvO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whatever LoveFrom works on, it’ll probably be expensive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S7eVHC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c2436fb5-d857-4aff-b81e-30141879711c"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that partnership includes contributions to Ferrari’s first electric car, which the company &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ferrari-ev-bumped-to-2025/"&gt;plans to introduce in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Ferrari also has a connection to a current Apple executive in Eddy Cue; Apple’s senior vice president of services &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ferrari-ev-bumped-to-2025/"&gt;sits on Ferrari’s board of directors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKCyBv"&gt;Both Jony Ive and Marc Newson have well-documented opinions about modern cars — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/2/16/8045625/jony-ive-apple-modern-car-design-is-shocking"&gt;they’re “insipid”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/14/9154871/apple-marc-newson-hates-modern-car-design"&gt;“at the bottom of a trough”&lt;/a&gt; — so it would be fascinating to see what they would do with an electric Prancing Horse. But it seems just as possible LoveFrom creates a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2022-ready-to-wear/ferrari"&gt;five-figure jacket or handbag instead&lt;/a&gt;. Like with Airbnb, the one thing that can be guaranteed is an exchange of clout. Ferrari and Exor are, at least in part, paying to attach their brands to the good design taste for which Ive and Newson are known. Maybe that’s worth more than connecting them to any one specific project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7xY21"&gt;What’s more certain is that it helps raise the profile of the duo’s design firm which, until now, remained even more ethereal than Ive’s hardware designs for Apple. The company and its work are so hard to grasp that the first result in a Google search of “LoveFrom” &lt;a href="https://lovefrom.style/"&gt;is a fan site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pzRn1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are our favorite MagSafe-compatible cases for the iPhone 13 </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xPF2ZE"&gt;Now that your brand-spanking-new iPhone 13 has arrived (or is on the way), it’s time to start thinking about protecting your baby. After all, it’s only a matter of time before your phone falls out of your pocket or makes contact with your keys, so it’s worth the extra investment now to prevent future damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CujTbM"&gt;Although MagSafe as an iPhone accessory standard is already a year old, Apple is off to a slow start building out its accessory ecosystem. Since its October 2020 launch event, Apple has only launched a dozen official MagSafe products: from the iconic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; puck to the 2021 &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMM0Q3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-golden-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Leather Wallet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KebrqK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPhone 13 Mini still gets slower MagSafe charging speeds ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"},{"title":"The Lightning port isn’t about convenience; it’s about control ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22690338/apple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe"},{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3z5diJ"&gt;Of course, third-party accessory makers are eager to make MagSafe products, too. Unfortunately, Apple is famously tight-fisted with its proprietary technology, even though its &lt;a href="https://mfi.apple.com/"&gt;MFi program&lt;/a&gt; is designed to license and control these very products. So third-party accessories like battery packs and chargers can only attach to the official MagSafe products and charge at 7.5W, rather than the 15W wireless charging standard that Apple-approved accessories can achieve. But third-party accessories tend to be cheaper in price and offer more selection than the official lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34HE13"&gt;In case you’re on the hunt for cases that will work with your official &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;, here are the top 10 third-party iPhone 13 cases that caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="p5LwVN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771970"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
