    <title>A show about Gawker proved too hot for Apple to handle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OuhDsLWx-0TnonkXLoi3zjdjnCU=/74x0:1451x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68514003/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBwXnT"&gt;Apple has killed an upcoming Apple TV Plus show about &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt;, a now-defunct news organization, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/business/media/apple-gawker-tim-cook.html"&gt;a report by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The show, called &lt;em&gt;Scraper&lt;/em&gt;, is one to add to the list of stories about Apple killing projects that touch things that are too sensitive or edgy for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpiG4e"&gt;When Tim Cook found out that Apple was working on the show, he reportedly sent an email saying that he was surprised to hear about it. He also mentioned he disliked Gawker. Although Apple has decided to kill the project, the show is back on the market, where another distributor could buy and finance it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iUD5oT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple executives have stepped in to steer their TV service away from controversy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qJbxxa"&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple executives have stepped in to steer their TV service away from controversy. In 2018 Apple reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-sex-please-were-apple-iphone-giant-seeks-tv-success-on-its-own-terms-1537588880"&gt;killed a movie about Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt; for having gratuitous violence and sex, and Apple executive Eddy Cue has reportedly said that the service will never do two things: “hardcore nudity and China”. Apple directed show-runners to avoid portraying China in a negative light, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/apple-china-tv-protesters-hong-kong-tim-cook"&gt;Buzzfeed has reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqxZkY"&gt;The executive who bought the show, Layne Eskridge, is leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unkwOG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; was inherently controversial — as Tim Cook personally knew. &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; outed him as gay in 2008. The Gawker Media Group&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;included several blogs; in 2010, one of them, &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-apple-lost-the-iphone-4-5520438"&gt;found and leaked the iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt; before it was launched. (Later, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/police-seize-jason-chens-computers-5524843"&gt;the reporter’s home was raided by police.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1QCL6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; is appealing as a show precisely because the blog has such a mixed legacy. It was one of the media outlets that &lt;a href="https://gawker.com/who-wants-to-remember-bill-cosbys-multiple-sex-assaul-1515923178"&gt;revived interest in Bill Cosby&lt;/a&gt;, who was later convicted of aggravated indecent assault. It also reported on rumored misconduct by Louis CK and &lt;a href="http://defamer.gawker.com/tell-us-what-you-know-about-harvey-weinsteins-open-sec-1695071092"&gt;Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JAHlR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker &lt;/em&gt;alums Max Read and Cord Jefferson are attached to the show. Jefferson has also written for &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Good Place&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Master of None. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVk0I9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt;, it seems, was born to bring controversy to everything it touched — even four years after its death.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.3 turns the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max into even better cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZTf4Wwz-AsxzbgiJBpQXh7JPM8=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511660/bfarsace_201106_4269_028.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0yKiG"&gt;If you’ve got an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max and consider yourself something of a photographer, the latest iOS update will help you get the most out of your phone’s cameras. That’s because it includes the new ProRAW feature that Apple first announced back at its October event. ProRAW combines the editing flexibility of RAW with Apple’s computational photography tricks like Smart HDR and Deep Fusion for the first time. You no longer have to choose between the flexibility of a standard RAW file and a JPEG or HEIC file that has all of Apple’s computational magic but limited potential for post-processing because ProRAW gives you both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn29Fn"&gt;Shooting RAW photos on an iPhone is nothing new; for some time now, apps like Halide and Adobe Lightroom have let you capture all of the data the iPhone’s sensor can gather. And all of the usual benefits of RAW are here with ProRAW — vastly improved control over white balance is always the biggest factor for me — but it gives you greater leeway with adjusting exposure, sharpness, dynamic range, and more. You can make better adjustments to facial tone in a portrait or nail the exposure in a landscape shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHU4fB"&gt;But standard RAW images can look very grainy out of the iPhone since, well, these are still small smartphone camera sensors, and they’re without any computational photography optimization. Now, you should notice all the same detail as before but with less noise. That’s because ProRAW images do the same multiframe image processing as ordinary iPhone shots. Even with that, you get around 14 stops of dynamic range to work with in editing software. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnaQ11QShvs"&gt;This video from Josh Stunell on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of illustrating the differences between RAW and ProRAW:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3RPjZ"&gt;ProRAW can be used with all of the rear cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max — it’s not going to suddenly turn the ultrawide into a magic lens, but anything helps — and it also works in night mode. You can even access the depth mapping information captured by the sensor to make portrait mode-style adjustments after the fact, provided your editing app allows you to control it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXbqRsJXIdQky0lT_oSOdnY1foA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022559/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can shoot ProRAW images with all three of the cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1x51ON"&gt;How to use ProRAW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F4ih6B"&gt;To use ProRAW, first, you’ve got to enable it under the camera options in the settings menu. After that, you’ll see a “RAW” button appear at the upper-right of the camera viewfinder, which is how you can quickly toggle ProRAW on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLtObT"&gt;I should emphasize that while it’s easy to switch this on, you’re definitely not going to want to use ProRAW all the time. Files average around 25MB in size, which is dramatically larger than your everyday iPhone images. This is a feature best reserved for those very intentional photos with people you care about or at places that matter. ProRAW images appear in the camera roll like normal, but if you try to share them in apps like Instagram, you’ll get an error message. So you’ll want to export them as either a smaller JPEG or HEIC file first before sending them to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBt331"&gt;Another nice thing about ProRAW is since it uses Adobe’s widely supported DNG file format, there is already a plethora of apps that can open and edit the files without any update. But apps that use Apple’s own RAW converter will offer even more control since they’ll be able to access tone and distance mapping. Halide has already released an update to get the most out of ProRAW, and I’d expect others like Pixelmator, Darkroom, and Affinity Photo to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NP2Oib"&gt;Apps that have their own RAW converter, namely Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and Capture One, can edit the DNG files today but won’t have all of the same capabilities as those that use Apple’s RAW converter. It’s possible Adobe and others will update their conversion tools in the future to make them work better with ProRAW. You can, of course, also just edit the images inside the Apple Photos app, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_l3ZTohF359m1aD2dhoBqv9yx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169707/IMG_0912_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sample ProRAW image edited in Darkroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBvhVB"&gt;If you want to share a ProRAW image, there are various ways to go about it depending on what you’re trying to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wDL3C4"&gt;If you want to transfer an Apple ProRAW to the computer: ensure the photo is unedited, then either AirDrop or plug the device into USB and use Image Capture or the Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sQEb3m"&gt;If you want to share an edited ProRAW photo:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;edit the photo in the Photos app, then AirDrop, email, or send via Messages. A JPG with the edits will be shared. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VP6iXO"&gt;If you want to email a ProRAW DNG to someone: open the Photos app first and use the share button to share via Mail. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ayEVZd"&gt;If you edit a ProRAW and want both the original DNG file and the edited JPG: use Image Capture or Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZbkyu"&gt;If a ProRAW is edited but you want to transfer a DNG: duplicate the photo, then revert the edits (makes it an unedited file). A DNG can then be AirDropped, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ic83mC"&gt;If you used a third-party app that can take RAW+JPG, and you want both: use Image Capture to grab each file individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="U7m9E1"&gt;I’ve been trying out ProRAW on my iPhone 12 Pro Max over the last few days, and I’m already appreciating the difference it can make. It’s just plain easier to get the most from a photo — retrieve highlights, boost shadows, fix the white balance, etc. — if you’re willing to put in the work of editing after the fact.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch expands its range of cardio fitness measurements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MZF_p6rHzWWg5qcqiTmTQIcUPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511554/apple_watch_series_6_dbohn_834.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8LbAqT"&gt;Apple is expanding the range of cardiorespiratory fitness that can be measured on the Apple Watch. Starting today, the Health app will classify users as having “high,” “above average,” “below average,” or “low” cardio fitness. Low levels will trigger a notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxcYAI"&gt;The Watch tracks fitness through a metric called VO2 max, which is the amount of oxygen your body consumes during movement or exercise. The Apple Watch was already tracking average and high VO2 max for users during exercise. This update expands the range it measures and allows users to see their levels when they’re walking around, not just when they’re working out. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38tz_1zBSHM870lZ1KB5AZTTpMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169614/Apple_iphone12_health_cardiofitness_high_12142020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find Cardio Fitness in the Health app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e16ONH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F12%2Fcardio-fitness-notifications-are-available-today-on-apple-watch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174552%2Fapple-watch-fitness-cardio-alerts#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it tracks lower ranges of VO2 max by using Watch sensors like the heart rate monitor and accelerometer. Typically, VO2 max is calculated using specialized equipment in a lab while someone exercises on a treadmill or other piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHMICi"&gt;“Apple Watch now brings estimation of low cardio fitness levels from clinics directly to a user’s wrist, so people have more insight into how they can improve their long-term health through daily activity,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F12%2Fcardio-fitness-notifications-are-available-today-on-apple-watch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174552%2Fapple-watch-fitness-cardio-alerts#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5neNBn"&gt;Wearing a Watch is certainly less time-intensive than going into a lab, but it may not be as accurate. &lt;a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20856601/can-your-watch-estimate-your-vo2-max/#:~:text=As%20the%20AHA%20statement%20noted,during%20a%2012%2Dminute%20run."&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; comparing Garmin and Polar smartwatches to typical lab testing found that the watches tended to be off by about 5 percent. Apple does not report how well the Watch compares to traditional, clinical VO2 max measurement methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNNMSA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9ZsDM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83GKo4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KipPia1gaxnOLI5WAvLtRaxJMmM=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511532/Apple_fitnessplus_applewatch_iphone12_hiit_workout_12142020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ExdzK"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163126/apple-fitness-plus-launch-date-subscription-service-price"&gt;Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; service is officially out now, marking the launch of the company’s latest subscription service. Fitness Plus offers a variety of guided workouts (similar to competitors like Peloton) and costs $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1uP46"&gt;At launch, the service features workouts in 10 categories: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), strength, yoga, dance, core, cycling, treadmill (for both running and walking), rowing, and “mindful cooldown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Is0lNI"&gt;To actually use Fitness Plus, you’ll need — at minimum — an Apple Watch Series 3 (or newer) running the just-released watchOS 7.2 update paired to an iPhone 6S (or newer) running the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22163752/ios-14-3-proraw-airpods-max-fitness-plus-available-now-download"&gt;also-just-released iOS 14.3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3613O"&gt;If you’re planning to use an iPad or Apple TV to view Fitness Plus videos, you’ll also need to have those devices updated to iOS 14.3 or tvOS 14.3, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pONw5l"&gt;Once you’ve updated your iPhone and Apple Watch, Fitness Plus can be accessed through a new tab in the Fitness app that’s preinstalled on your phone. iPad users will be able to download &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitness/id1208224953"&gt;the Fitness app from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, while Apple TV users will automatically see the app installed once they’ve updated to tvOS 14.3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i1f3q"&gt;Existing Apple Watch owners can get a one-month free trial of Fitness Plus, while customers who buy an Apple Watch Series 3 (or newer) can get three months of free service. A single Fitness Plus subscription can be shared with up to six users through Apple’s Family Sharing service, and it’s also included in the Apple One Premier plan (which includes Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, and 2TB of iCloud storage for $29.95 per month).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.3 has arrived with ProRAW for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 Pro camera app in use" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2qMsMMZNsBnOi0Z23G2uJ_9sEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510836/akrales_201017_4238_0016.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;With iOS 14.3, the iPhone 12 Pro camera app will support a new kind of RAW image capture | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TnaGT5"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.3 has arrived, giving iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max owners the ProRAW feature that was promised when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21504764/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-screen-size-5g-features-price-release-date"&gt;devices were announced&lt;/a&gt;. Other features in this update include search improvements for the Apple TV app, support for Fitness Plus  — Apple’s new subscription-based workout service — and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;recently announced AirPods Max headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iIXoU"&gt;iPhones have long been able to capture RAW images, but doing so has meant giving up the benefits of all the computational magic that happens when shooting a standard image with the native camera app. ProRAW is designed to address that: it’s a format that combines the computational benefits of Apple’s image processing with the post-processing flexibility of a RAW file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqPupH"&gt;In iOS 14.3, Apple is flipping the ProRAW “on” switch for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max — and those two devices only. With the update installed, ProRAW image capture and editing will be enabled in the native camera and photos apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Y0fbua"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro review: ahead of its time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: the best smartphone camera you can get","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oth5QR"&gt;This update also addresses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169881/apple-iphone-ios-14-text-messages-no-notifications-bug"&gt;an irritating bug&lt;/a&gt; where some users weren’t getting notifications for new incoming messages. And on the lighter side, Siri gets an update with hundreds of animal, instruments, and vehicle sounds. The new feature works on HomePod, iPhones and iPads; just ask Siri what sound a humpback whale makes and you’ll get a demonstration. If you’re on an iPhone or iPad, you’ll also get a visual to go along with the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLTutb"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/08/ios-14-3-release-candidate-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, 14.3 also makes it easier to customize app icons since home screen shortcuts no longer need to open the Shortcuts app. Other iOS 14.3 highlights include the ability to record video at 25fps, updates to Apple TV app search and a new Apple TV Plus tab, front-facing camera mirroring in still photos for devices from the iPhone 6S and newer, and new Cycle Tracking features in the Health app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches new App Store privacy labels so you can see how iOS apps use your data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foLTsv1S9sSgbk_TvqGmKOS1qiA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510737/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nyix9w"&gt;Apple is making good on its promise to provide more transparency around iOS app data collection with the launch of new privacy labels on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzS8jj"&gt;The company first announced its intention to provide these so-called “nutrition label” privacy disclosures &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;back in June during WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, and last month Apple disclosed that developers would have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551926/apple-privacy-developers-nutrition-labels-app-store-ios-14"&gt;provide this information by December 8th&lt;/a&gt; or risk losing the ability to update their apps. Now, following that deadline, Apple is launching the feature officially for all iOS device owners running the latest version of iOS 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q6tEa"&gt;Apple says the new labels will be required for apps on all of its platforms — that includes iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — and they will have to be up to date and accurate every time a developer submits a new update. Apple is also holding itself to the same standard, something the company clarified last week when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;Facebook-owned WhatsApp criticized the company&lt;/a&gt; for an apparent inconsistency in its requirements, before Apple said it, too, will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165959/apple-privacy-nutrition-labels-all-apps-preinstalled-messages-web"&gt;provide labels for all its own software&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cszf52"&gt;The company’s own first-party apps will all have the same disclosures on their App Store product pages. In the event an app doesn’t have an App Store product page because it cannot be removed, like the Messages app, Apple says it will be providing privacy label information on the web. Every piece of software on the App Store will also have its privacy label viewable on the web, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p6KlEhLz0kQr5rC5lJ6tl5cQVTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168998/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_10.33.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R49pJY"&gt;As for how the labels are structured, Apple has broken down data collection into three categories: “data used to track you,” “data linked to you,” and “data not linked to you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Mg0q"&gt;Tracking in this context means the app developer is linking data from the app — like personal information, or data collected from your device, such as location data — with other data from other companies’ apps or websites for the purpose of targeted advertising or some other ad-related metric. Apple says it’s also using the term tracking here to mean sharing user or device information with companies that sell it, like data brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7m37s"&gt;The “data linked to you” portion of the label is any data that can be used to identify you. That means data gleaned from using the app or having an account with the service or platform, and any data pulled from the device itself that could be used to create a profile for advertising purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKBRDn"&gt;“Data not linked to you” is the portion of the privacy label that clarifies when certain data types, like location data or browsing history, are not being linked to you in any identifiable fashion. Apple has specific, developer-focused information on the new labels &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/"&gt;at its developer portal page&lt;/a&gt;, with more general information available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapple.com%2Fprivacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174017%2Fapple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the consumer-facing page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFjT8f"&gt;This isn’t the last of Apple’s major privacy changes coming with iOS 14. The company intends to release a new privacy feature requiring developers to ask for explicit permission to track iOS device users across apps and websites using a unique device identifier, called an IDFA (or Identification for Advertisers) code. The plan was to require this with the launch of iOS 14, but Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;announced in September&lt;/a&gt; that it would delay the feature until some time next year, to give developers more time to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is offering two-hour delivery for just $5 for a limited time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4CjD4Dc-aHIXVZevPiiPAw2S2Xg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510623/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8bGSNF"&gt;Apple is offering two-hour delivery for just $5 on “eligible in-stock items” from its retail stores. If you need to get a gift for an Apple-loving person in your life this holiday season, that $5 shipping could be a handy way to get that gift in a pinch. The company says it offers scheduled courier delivery of eligible items “in most metros.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQkRCI"&gt;That low $5 fee won’t last forever, though — in the fine print on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fshipping-pickup&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174360%2Fapple-two-hour-delivery-price-holidays#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it’s a limited time offer. And you can’t use it on customized Macs, engraved products, or orders paid with financing or by bank transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAVkF1"&gt;If you don’t need your purchase within two hours, Apple says it offers free next-day delivery on any in-stock Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, or Apple Watch, and free two-day delivery on “almost everything else.” The company also has a useful guide that lists &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fholiday-shipping&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174360%2Fapple-two-hour-delivery-price-holidays#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;when you’ll need to order a product&lt;/a&gt; in order to get it by December 24th with free shipping, though some items, like the HomePod mini, are already unavailable for delivery by Christmas Eve with free shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9st2en"&gt;Apple is also allowing you to initiate returns for “eligible products received between November 10, 2020 and December 25, 2020” until January 8th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020: bad year, good gadgets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OQqLTrxs-WRnsuQMaVYmqYyoRIE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68509995/VRG_ILLO_4320_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Game hardware and laptops both started promising new generations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="if2UI8"&gt;It doesn’t feel right to praise much of anything in 2020, but here goes: the gadgets were good. In a year when many of us have been more dependent than ever on our screens to stay connected, do our jobs, and just stay sane, the technology behind them has been better than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdyWAj"&gt;Big tech promised generational changes in consumer technology this year. The new Macs and the new gaming hardware we got in 2020 really have kicked off noticeably different and better eras in computing. I don’t like using grandiose phrases like “eras in computing,” but there’s really no other way to put it. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony, and AMD &lt;em&gt;actually delivered&lt;/em&gt; on their bombastic claims. That’s not usually how it goes. It’s a little bewildering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwVwTa"&gt;So yes, there were the usual hits and misses in this year’s gadgets, but what’s different is the hits were blockbusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7vIpR"&gt;The biggest star has to be the M1 chip in Apple’s new laptops and the Mac Mini. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;very nearly gave the MacBook Air a perfect score&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, a processor transition means app incompatibility problems that go on for years, but you have to go to strange edge cases to find apps that just don’t work. Normally, apps designed for the old chips run slow, but in some cases, they run faster on the M1. Normally, speed improvements and battery improvements are measured in single percentage points, but these laptops are astonishingly fast and last forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="UnRvkH"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="M1 MacBook Pro and Air review: Apple delivers|96773" data-volume-uuid="6412f55d2" data-volume-id="96773" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-402" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9l52"&gt;It’s hard to express what a big deal this is. More than once, we would have to double- and triple-check our test results because they seemed too good to be true. I do not know how Windows PCs are going to respond. Thus far, emulated apps that run in Windows on Arm have been slow and buggy, while Intel-based machines are unlikely to match the M1’s battery life. It’s going to be a tough row for the entire PC industry to hoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNU2EG"&gt;Then there’s the new slate of gaming hardware, which all seemed to land at once and which all seem to be impossible to find at any retail site. Before this year, getting 4K, HDR, and high refresh rates all at the same time was a stretch goal at best. After 2020, it’s accessible on PC or console (assuming you can find the hardware in stock and buy it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snHnKU"&gt;The new graphics cards from both Nvidia and AMD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;force away the trade-offs gamers usually have to make in their graphics settings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-reviewhttps://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and S&lt;/a&gt; don’t have a slate of next-gen launch titles, but they have competently and quietly made existing games run faster and look better. And they also have a ton of potential for the future with Microsoft’s Game Pass Ultimate subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="iEsayI"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="PlayStation 5 Review: a next-gen feel|96572" data-volume-uuid="eae294ab6" data-volume-id="96572" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-864" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uXiAyI"&gt;The Playstation 5, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;surprised us all by having a new controller that offers some genuinely new and engaging experiences&lt;/a&gt;. It seems weird to enthuse about haptics and trigger resistance, but you really can feel the difference. The PS5’s fundamentals as a console are also strong — though the design of course remains polarizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9kKAs"&gt;Taken as a whole, the new PC graphics cards and the new consoles really do represent the beginning of a set of next-gen gaming experiences. And unlike the last time we got a big console refresh, it doesn’t seem like any of them have significantly stumbled out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGeWA1"&gt;The phones of 2020 were also great. It’s hard to remember because it was a thousand years ago, but Samsung’s Galaxy S20 line launched in March as the first flagship 5G phones. It’s weird to suggest that anything Samsung does is quiet, but the S20 and S20 plus were just quietly the best Android phones this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TgPWVL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Samsung Galaxy S20 review: better than the Ultra|75203" data-volume-uuid="dc391ca04" data-volume-id="75203" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-439" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSFjkN"&gt;5G turned out to be the most explicit claim to making something “next generation” that did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pan out. In the US especially, 5G is only slightly better than 4G for people who can find a signal in the first place. Even so, the phones that were meant to usher in the 5G era were great — not because they had 5G, but because they were simply well-made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yabrti"&gt;The new iPhones were also great — and launched along with a confident claim that “5G is real now.” But as with Samsung’s phones, the iPhone 12 lineup is great despite 5G, not because of it. The iPhone 12 mini, in particular, finally made a top-tier phone available to people who have felt that everything since the iPhone 5S was too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GytRYJ"&gt;Hell, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 finally made good on the promise of the original&lt;/a&gt;. Overpriced and blingy? Yes. But also a really good little tablet that folds up. I know at least one &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor who I shall not name (it’s not me) who bought one and loves it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovOg71"&gt;Then there are the gadgets that don’t purport to be next-gen anything but nevertheless were simply &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG G14 Zephyrus gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;GoPro Hero 9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550181/dji-mavic-mini-2-drone-4k-price-release-date-battery-life"&gt;DJI’s Mini 2 drone getting OcuSync wireless&lt;/a&gt; and its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21517121/dji-ronin-s2-sc2-rs2-rsc2-gimbals-announced-price"&gt;Ronan gimbals getting built-in focus wheels&lt;/a&gt;; Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514758/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;Mario Kart Live Home Circuit remote control AR cars&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof S3 e-bike&lt;/a&gt;; Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;WH-1000XM4 headphones&lt;/a&gt;; and Dell’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;latest XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. Even smart speakers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; significantly improved their sound while Apple finally hit a reasonable price point with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="t6bq6y"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="The Verge’s favorite gadgets of 2020|96860" data-volume-uuid="a521f8b3f" data-volume-id="96860" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-736" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2Zovz"&gt;I wish I could tell you what ties this year’s wave of good gadgets into a coherent trend. It wouldn’t be right to tie any of this to the pandemic — the lead times on everything mentioned here are such that they would have begun development well before lockdown. Certainly there was an effort to make “next-gen” products feel worthy of the description, but I don’t think that explains it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GdJ5B3"&gt;If I’m honest, I think it’s just luck. A bunch of technologies happened to mature around the same time and a bunch of companies happened to be ready to do something with them. In a year when so many things have gone predictably bad, it’s nice that this one small thing was unpredictably nice. The gadgets were good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDBY5b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FA7S3S"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KP7G9F"&gt;Workers at an iPhone production plant in India reportedly smashed windows and set fire to vehicles to protest reductions in pay, the &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/violence-breaks-out-at-wistron-corps-iphone-manufacturing-plant-near-bengaluru/articleshow/79691511.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times of India &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The incidents began Saturday at a facility run by Taiwan manufacturing company Wistron Corporation, where the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/24/iphone-se-assembled-in-india/"&gt; iPhone SE is assembled.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIUGQr"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/angry-at-delayed-payments-employees-ransack-narsapura-plant-where-iphones-are-made-7102392/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian Express&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; during a shift change workers who said they had seen their pay reduced damaged the offices, some furniture, and factory equipment before things escalated outside. A local official told the &lt;em&gt;Express &lt;/em&gt;that police were investigating the incident. About 2,000 workers were involved in the protest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5ncnBF"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15651842/apple-iphone-india-assembling-begun"&gt;began assembling iPhones in India &lt;/a&gt;in 2017, where it &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-tops-indias-premium-smartphone-market-with-a-756-share"&gt;tops the premium smartphone&lt;/a&gt; market. However, it only has about a 1 percent share of the total smartphone market in the country, since the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-apple-wistron/apple-supplier-wistron-to-assemble-key-iphone-component-in-new-india-plant-sources-idUSKBN1ZX0F6"&gt;iPhone’s price tag puts it out of reach&lt;/a&gt; for many Indian consumers. &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/india-surpassed-usa-become-second-largest-smartphone-market-world-reaching-158-million-shipments-2019/"&gt;India was the second-biggest smartphone market&lt;/a&gt; in the world in 2019, ahead of the US and second only to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POOpJN"&gt;Wistron opened the plant near Bengaluru earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/business/technology/wistron-to-assemble-key-apple-iphone-component-in-india-sources-801036.html"&gt;part of a multimillion dollar investment&lt;/a&gt; by the company in India. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iPhone has an aggravating text notifications bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FqOH0y"&gt;If you’ve noticed that you’re receiving SMS texts and iMessages from people but aren’t getting any notifications about them, you’re not alone. Far from it. I’m one of many people experiencing an annoying bug where messages come through fine — but without any pop-up notification or even the usual red badge to indicate that there’s a new message waiting to be read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsOeVu"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/13/iphone-12-missing-sms-text-messages/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; wrote about increasing reports of the problem&lt;/a&gt; on the new iPhone 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max phones. But it seems to also be affecting people with older iPhones as well, so this is looking more and more like an iOS 14 issue. What’s more aggravating about the glitch is that it doesn't &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; happen. I’ve noticed some messages pop up on my lock screen like normal, but others just quietly roll in with me being none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfDAlB"&gt;People in that very large &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; thread have tried to come up with workarounds like turning off Messages on a Mac, or deleting and re-adding contacts. Some are noticing they get notifications if they completely force close the Messages app every time after sending a text. And in other cases, the missing notifications are only happening for pinned conversations, and unpinning contacts seems to do the trick. There are sporadic reports of success with these short-term fixes, but they aren’t working for everyone. There’s also &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251815788"&gt;this 42-page thread on the company’s support forums&lt;/a&gt; about the ongoing frustrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o91b1E"&gt;Those dealing with the issue are understandably disappointed that Apple hasn’t released a thorough fix yet. This is pretty fundamental stuff, and it’s probably causing some awkward conversations between couples or friends when messages just sit there for hours without the recipient knowing they came. And if you’re hoping that all will be well when iOS 14.3 releases next week, I wouldn’t be so sure. Early reports indicate that the no-text-notifications bug remains present — at least in some cases — in the second release candidate build of iOS 14.3 that Apple pushed out to public beta testers yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A4RJ9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Apple for more information on the status of this bug and the company’s plans to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
