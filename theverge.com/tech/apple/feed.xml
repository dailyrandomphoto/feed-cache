    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 review: time and time again</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A bigger screen and faster charging are nice, but not reasons to upgrade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="r78a4Q"&gt;The most important questions to ask about the new Apple Watch Series 7 aren’t about the Apple Watch Series 7, they’re about the Apple Watch you may already have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbnGfL"&gt;That’s a gentle way of saying that if there’s nothing wrong with your current watch, there’s nothing in the Series 7 that should compel you to upgrade. If you’ve been waiting for some key feature before buying your first Apple Watch, I don’t know that it’s here, either. I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;wrote very nearly the same thing last year about the Series 6&lt;/a&gt; and I think that’s just what we should expect from the Apple Watch series going forward: iterative updates that will be great when you replace your current watch, but not a reason to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxqaof"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; great. The larger screen and faster charging are the two headline features and both are welcome. The Apple Watch is in a class entirely of its own right now. Nothing else is as good for iPhone users and nothing like it is available for Android users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rr2QCi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10803240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen is 20 percent larger on the Apple Watch Series 7" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFtnb290teD_pSpxCtzldF4z6RE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908902/vpavic_211006_4796_0039.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen is 20 percent larger on the Apple Watch Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PE3CaZ"&gt;Apple Watch design and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3WRkBW"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 didn’t get the major redesign that had been rumored. Instead, it looks almost identical to previous Apple Watches and maintains compatibility with all previous Apple Watch straps, although there are incredibly subtle changes in its overall size and curves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5lOXW"&gt;There are new color options available, including midnight (which apparently has a hint of blue in it), starlight (a cross between silver and gold), and a dark green. Apple sent me the green one and in most light it just looks gray — but every now and then it’ll pop and look visibly green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="zrbgNb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bigger screen isn’t a reason to upgrade on its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 7 (left) and Series 5 (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/77CIVaV1KTdYeOe_pX865bYXJyQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908911/vpavic_211006_4796_0094.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 (left) and Series 5 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The front glass is thicker and more crack resistant, with a “refractive” edge and smaller bezels." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xM7yM8Zskz023avG3FK7K9F8Vbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908913/vpavic_211006_4796_0110.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The front glass is thicker and more crack resistant, with a “refractive” edge and smaller bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JFRGJH"&gt;The biggest change is the screen; it’s 20 percent larger than the last few iterations of the Apple Watch. It does the thing all screen upgrades tend to do: make the older screen with its larger bezels look small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8gyzF"&gt;When Apple first made the screen bigger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17875882/new-apple-watch-series-4-review-ekg-bands-screen-price"&gt;way back on the Apple Watch Series 4&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it made an appreciable difference in the experience and would even be worth upgrading for. Here, on the Series 7, I just think the screen is really nice and looks better, but isn’t enough to justify an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxje9k"&gt;Apple has kept the always-on screen and says that it is brighter in ambient mode when indoors. That is: the overall max brightness hasn’t changed, but when you’re inside, the screen should look a little less dim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGHWO4"&gt;The other design change on the Series 7 is that it’s more durable. The front crystal on all models is thicker and stronger against cracking. (It’s also more refractive, so you can catch a glimpse of some pixels at extreme angles.) The whole watch adds IP6X dust resistance for the first time and maintains the same water resistance to 50 meters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxcE07"&gt;Apple didn’t add any new health sensors to the Series 7. It still tracks heart rate and has a blood oxygen monitor and EKG. None of these sensors should be used for diagnostic purposes as the Apple Watch is not a medical device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7 charges faster but has the same overall battery life." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9NguEoxluYKwrSjCZzXL_9ZraI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908901/vpavic_211006_4796_0032_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 charges faster but has the same overall battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jUuETH"&gt;Apple Watch charging and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6hmjtu"&gt;Apple is still targeting 18 hours of battery life on the Apple Watch Series 7. It’s enough to get through a day — maybe two if you turn off the always-on screen and don’t work out. In my tests, those numbers are borne out. I need to charge the Series 7 only a little less often than I need to charge my old Series 5 (which is starting to lose its battery capacity a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlwDN6"&gt;I wish Apple had done more to improve battery life on the Series 7, especially since this is technically a redesign. I would have even taken the same size screen as last year’s model if it had meant getting longer battery life instead. There’s nothing &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with the Apple Watch’s battery life, but I do wish that it aimed higher like the new iPhones did this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7WklxI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Faster charging is nice, but I was hoping for more battery life&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2KC2rF"&gt;Instead, we got faster charging thanks to a redesigned charging puck that also uses USB-C. Lots of people have those wall adapters but may need to pick up a second one (or a multi-charger), since it’s not included in the box. (As an aside, the actual plug part of the Apple Watch charger is longer now, which Apple says is to manage heat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8HzHt"&gt;The charging is faster. Apple claims it’s 33 percent faster than the older cable and that sounds right to me. I have been able to juice up 20 percent in just ten minutes several times and it has been easier to top off to a full charge in the morning while I putter around with coffee and breakfast. It makes it slightly more convenient to use the watch for sleep tracking since it’s easier to fit a quick charging session in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR96Ld"&gt;Still and all, I would have preferred standard Qi charging to faster charging (if I had to choose). Qi charging mats are cheap and plentiful now, but integrating an Apple Watch charger adds cost and complexity. Older Apple Watch chargers will work just fine with the Series 7, but at the slightly slower charging speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are a few Series 7 exclusive features in WatchOS 8, including a keyboard." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pMVHZYvkBKwH28N7OxsRRj5YsDI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908905/vpavic_211006_4796_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are a few Series 7 exclusive features in WatchOS 8, including a keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHHCCf"&gt;WatchOS 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CV85Vt"&gt;There are a few features in WatchOS 8 that are exclusive to the Series 7, ostensibly because its larger screen makes them possible. The watch can fit just a little more text when reading a message, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Umfs96"&gt;The two watchfaces custom to the Series 7 are called “Contour” and “Modular Duo.” The former just puts numbers out on the edges of the screen and would apparently look bad on screens with larger bezels, while the latter allows you to have two full-width complications stacked instead of just one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1uxTv"&gt;The larger screen also allows for a new text-entry option: a miniature keyboard. You can tap or swipe on it and as long as autocorrect is doing its thing correctly, it works fine. It’s about as good as any smartwatch keyboard I’ve used, but I still prefer dictating messages via Siri whenever possible. I wish I could compare it to the FlickType app that was kicked out of the App Store in January 2019, but it’s not back (and there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22676706/apple-watch-swipe-keyboard-flicktype-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;lawsuit pending&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="VfJzvf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can finally set multiple timers in WatchOS 8 (but not on iOS 15)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Modular Duo face lets the Series 7 (right) have two full-width complications. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P0FGiHFxbhMUUAiOXnPFVa00vJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908909/vpavic_211006_4796_0084.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Modular Duo face lets the Series 7 (right) have two full-width complications. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Contour watch face is exclusive to the Series 7." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1izd5PwAiJ8EuI3ro7gZ9xU2PK8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908910/vpavic_211006_4796_0090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Contour watchface is exclusive to the Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L3Nlnp"&gt;Those are the Series 7-specific features, but WatchOS 8 has a few more things worth covering. It’s able to auto-detect outdoor bike workouts — and in my testing it managed to do that very well, even when I was hitting stoplights at every block. I wish Apple would make it easier to integrate the Watch’s workout data with cadence or power sensors on a bike, but cyclists are still on their own to figure out how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Au4ZXk"&gt;Apple says it’s also adjusting your calorie metrics if the watch believes you’re riding an e-bike. There’s no setting for it, it just detects if your heart rate is suspiciously low and your speed is remarkably high as you cruise up a hill. There’s also no indicator in your results if your calorie metrics were adjusted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAau3a"&gt;WatchOS 8 has a redesigned photos app and lets you send photos directly from the watch. It has an updated “Mindfulness” app with a “Reflect” feature that gives you some kind of prompt to meditate on, like “Recall a challenge you’ve overcome” and “Think about what sparks your creative energy.” As you can probably tell from the unnecessary scare quotes in the previous sentence, I don’t like it. I think meditation is a deeply personal — and for many people spiritual or religious — thing, and so I recoil whenever I see tech companies reducing the practice down to anodyne apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY7h6u"&gt;I’ve left the best for last: the Apple Watch lets you set multiple timers. You can set them in the timer app. You can set them with Siri. You can use Siri to name each timer. You can see all your timers stacked one after the other. It’s magical. It’s wonderful. It’s hilarious that it took until 2021 to make this happen and even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; hilarious that the iPhone itself &lt;em&gt;still can’t do it&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXp6kk"&gt;Seriously, though, multiple timers on the Apple Watch is great, especially for cooking. It means I don’t need to stay within earshot of the smart speaker in my kitchen if I’ve got something in the oven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7 in green." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HzI7QElmyePeOV3IGRw5j3oxyGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908899/vpavic_211006_4796_0029.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 in green.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iyi6xQ"&gt;I have said this every year for several years now because it’s true every year: the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch for iPhone users, by far. There are fitness trackers that fulfill niches not filled by the Apple Watch like Garmins for more serious athletes or Fitbits for people who want something simpler. But as a general computer-on-your-wrist, the Apple Watch Series 7 is challenged only by older Apple Watches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3zFWYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Still the best smartwatch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YghhQR"&gt;If you have one of those older Apple Watches, I don’t think there’s anything here that should compel an upgrade. All the new features are very nice but not necessary. If there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something that’s bothering you about your current watch, then by all means go for it if you can afford it. Also, while the Series 3 is still kicking around for cheap, I don’t think it’s a great buy anymore. The Apple Watch SE is a better value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIc4JH"&gt;There’s no reason that we should have an expectation of major year-on-year updates for the Apple Watch. These smaller iterations might not be what we’ve been hoping for — a big redesign with much more battery — but that doesn’t make the Series 7 bad on its own merits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="vaBJsW"&gt;It’s a great watch — again, the best smartwatch. If it’s time for you to replace your watch (or buy your first one), you’ll love it. If it’s not time to replace your watch, it’s not time to replace your watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="1A6fiL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10803297"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple exploring AirPods that take your temperature and monitor posture: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cOI7_9H7qLMFVkk_kc1jSClRIuk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988163/akrales_161216_1332_A_0259_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NMjpHH"&gt;Apple is reportedly exploring new health-focused features for its AirPods, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-studying-potential-of-airpods-as-health-device-11634122800"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Features might include using the earbuds to take wearers’ temperature, monitor their posture, and improve their hearing. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that it’s not clear if the latter function differs significantly from AirPods’ existing “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;Conversation Boost&lt;/a&gt;” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zGsMO"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, these functions “aren’t expected by next year and might never be rolled out to consumers or the timing could change.” In other words, it sounds like the iPhone maker is just exploring these new health features, rather than actively working on integrating them with products due out in the next year or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJnoTc"&gt;Adding these sensors would make sense for Apple. The company has increasingly marketed its products on the strength of their health and fitness applications, though so far, most of this attention has been focused on the Apple Watch. Reports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; suggested the company was looking into adding various sensors to the wearable, including monitoring blood pressure, temperature, sleep quality, blood oxygen, and blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srnaZf"&gt;Integrating health features into commercial products is tricky work, though, mostly because of the difficulty in meeting the high bar of medical regulatory standards. This inevitably leads to delays. It was &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in June, for example, that the next Apple Watch would add temperature monitoring, but this function never appeared in September’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RF0o5J"&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t include much detail about Apple’s plans for the AirPods. Taking temperature from someone’s ear is commonplace, though, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40438857/i-tried-five-high-tech-solutions-that-promised-to-fix-my-terrible-posture-did-they-work"&gt;many posture devices&lt;/a&gt; on the market that use digital sensors to alert wearers when they’re slouching. Apple has already shown it’s interested in using AirPods as a hearing assistant of some sort, though the earbuds are not actually approved for this purpose by the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly can’t get enough chips for the iPhone 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UIk7a3dRnllE-5WPncwjzWcYPYc=/0x0:2028x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986132/vpavic_210916_4760_0082.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfElgh"&gt;The chip shortage is hitting the iPhone 13, with Apple reportedly unable to get enough parts to hit its planned manufacturing goals, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-aapl-to-cut-iphone-production-targets-due-to-chip-shortage?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple had originally planned to produce 90 million iPhones in the final months of 2021, but it’s reportedly slashing that number by 10 million (or around 11 percent) due to supply issues with chips from Broadcom and Texas Instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy8ePE"&gt;While the primary A15 Bionic SoC on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro is manufactured by TSMC, there are plenty of other chip-based components inside the phone that come from other sources. As iFixit’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B13%2BPro%2BFull%2BChip%2BID%2F144993&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F12%2F22723209%2Fapple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;thorough teardown of the iPhone 13 Pro’s logic board&lt;/a&gt; shows, Texas Instruments and Broadcom are responsible for several key components, including chips that handle display power management, Face ID’s laser array, USB connectivity, wireless power, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yaz8Ky"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The shadow of the chip shortage is looming over tech’s big quarter","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6KZnLs"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"&gt;already warned&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-tesla-to-take-hit-from-chip-shortage-a-sign-of-problems-intensity-11627474416"&gt;company’s Q3 earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that it might see chip supply issues, noting that “we’ll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we’re dealt.” But it seems that even with Apple’s best efforts and favorable relationships with suppliers, it just can’t get the physical components together that it needs to make enough iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19nqBT"&gt;It’s likely that Apple will eventually manage to get production up, but the slashed manufacturing estimate means that it’ll probably be even more difficult to find an (already tough to get ahold of) iPhone 13 in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to transfer your Google Authenticator 2FA to a new phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google apps 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QjVD9k3z6qn6JMeGSQem9PSIWf8=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67344098/1008258386.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by S3studio/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fpM5Ry"&gt;Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the best and easiest ways to keep your online accounts secure. It works by issuing an authentication code on your phone when somebody tries to access the account; if that person doesn’t have the code, they (or you) don’t get in. By using a 2FA app, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, you can prevent somebody from accessing your data by getting your password. (You can have a code texted to you, but that is considered far less secure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564381/community-hacking-sim-hijacking-cryptocurrency"&gt;due to the rise of so-called SIM hacking&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czgQrl"&gt;There is, of course, a catch. Because 2FA uses a key specific to your phone, if you lose or break your phone, you can’t simply reinstall the app on your new phone and go on from there. You need to transfer the key code for that phone as well as the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="URpdzV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to set up two-factor authentication on all your online accounts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/17/15772142/how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7PpqsB"&gt;Different authentication apps handle this in different ways. In this article, I’m going to look at Google Authenticator, including the easiest way to transfer the app to a new phone if you do have access to the old one, and how you can prepare for a possible problem (like a broken phone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Is3Vpn"&gt;Google Authenticator lets you establish 2FA by using your phone to scan a QR code generated by the app on a separate device or by entering a key code. It’s a relatively easy process — unless you find you have to move the app to a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02bKEg"&gt;Because 2FA uses security keys that are specific to each piece of hardware, you can’t simply reinstall Google Authenticator on your new phone and use it to log in. Instead, you have to transfer the keys to your new app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsZK4D"&gt;The easiest method, especially if you use 2FA with several apps, is to use the Authenticator app’s dedicated transfer feature to move your keys from one phone to the other. However, there are two assumptions here: first, that you have access to both the old and new phone, and second, that you have Android devices. If either of these assumptions doesn’t work for your situation, there are other methods you can use, which we’ll cover next. But first, the easy method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XquXdx"&gt;Transfer your Authenticator keys via Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VDaOp7"&gt;If you’ve got two Android phones, you can transfer your accounts to a new phone by exporting them via a QR code generated by the Authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="87Arix"&gt;Install Google Authenticator on your new phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tzp7zN"&gt;Tap “Get started.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u8otzk"&gt;Tap “Scan a QR code.” You’ll get a grid and instructions to “Place QR code within red lines.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cQRq8O"&gt;Open Google Authenticator on your older phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c1Iuv5"&gt;Tap on the three dots on the top right of the screen and select “Transfer accounts”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VsTg7c"&gt;Select “Export accounts.” You may be asked to verify your identity via a fingerprint, password, or another method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iLMidD"&gt;Uncheck which accounts you don’t want to export. Tap “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hvE9GK"&gt;You’ll be shown a QR code. Center it in the grid in your new phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xJTRaf"&gt;You should see the imported app now listed in your Google Authenticator app in the new phone. (Note: the app will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be deleted from your old phone.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zx8ufp"&gt;Alternative method #1: Use your backup codes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TyE2Kk"&gt;When you first set up Google Authenticator, you may be given a set of backup codes and asked to print them out or otherwise save them. And you definitely do want to save them; print them out and put them somewhere safe or create a PDF and save it where nobody else can access it. If your phone goes south, these codes will be a good way to reestablish authentication on your new phone — assuming, of course, you haven’t misplaced the codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSjHAl"&gt;This is also the way to reestablish your keys on a new iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3obrx"&gt;If you missed that step during the installation, you can get those backup codes anyway. For that, you have to &lt;a href="https://myaccount.google.com/"&gt;go into your Google account&lt;/a&gt; and then follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4qZ6C0"&gt;Click on “Security” in the left-hand column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nu4Jy8"&gt;Scroll down to and select “2-Step Verification.” You’ll probably have to enter your password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pX2cHM"&gt;Scroll down to “Backup Codes” and click on “Show Codes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Show Codes” to get your ten backup codes for your Google account. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjOPbBjbxGfCYoaXJJsk4QjXWBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920572/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_10.40.23_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Show Codes” to get your ten backup codes for your Google account. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fK3y9x"&gt;You’ll get a list of 10 codes. Each code can be used once; if you use them all, you can get more by clicking on “Show Codes” and then on “Get New Codes.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UDvz7q"&gt;Alternative method #2: Take a screenshot of the barcode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fmnJtp"&gt;One way to create a backup in case you lose your phone is to take and save a screenshot of the barcode that is created for each 2FA-secured app. If you’ve mislaid your backup codes, but you’ve saved a screenshot of the QR barcode that you originally used to create your app’s authentication, you can use that screenshot to establish your credentials on a new phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbuGUo"&gt;Just throw the screenshot up on your computer, install Google Authenticator on your new phone, and use the plus sign on the app to scan the barcode. (You can also enter the setup key code if that’s what you saved.) Do this for each of your apps, and you’ll be all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkGcse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 12th, 2021, 11:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on September 2nd, 2020; the directions for transferring between Android phones have been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces October 18th event after months of Mac rumors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple October 18th event invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/POOvNv7zsPYLW-WxI4c3CpaPjmU=/92x0:1328x824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69984773/image__7_.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xRoatW"&gt;Apple’s next hardware event will take place on October 18th, according to invites it sent out today. The company is widely expected to use its second fall event to launch a pair of new MacBooks, a redesigned higher-end Mac Mini, and possibly a pair of third-generation AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4gYMr"&gt;The invite video teases one word: Unleashed. As seen below in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from Apple marketing exec Greg Joswiak, it appears in a dotted font that could hint at mini LED tech on the way. The “special” event will stream live on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/"&gt;Apple.com&lt;/a&gt; at 1PM ET / 10AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTTWne"&gt;There have been reports for months that Apple is on the cusp of releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models&lt;/a&gt;. The new MacBooks would be the latest step in Apple’s transition away from Intel chips, replacing them with an Arm-based processor called the M1X that Apple designs itself. The new chip could boost performance compared to the M1 chip that debuted last year, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-set-for-first-macbook-pro-revamp-in-five-years-on-oct-18?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt; the M1X has ten CPU cores compared to the M1’s eight, plus graphics processors with 16 or 32 cores compared to seven or eight in M1-equipped machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8HShL"&gt;Other anticipated features include the return of fan-favorite MacBook features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;magnetic MagSafe charging&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;HDMI port, and an SD card slot&lt;/a&gt;. The maligned OLED touch bar, mercifully, could be on the way out. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1447700808821260292?s=20"&gt;Gurman recently noted&lt;/a&gt; that stock of the company’s existing MacBook Pro appears to be running low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A370IL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Unleashed! These next six days are going to speed by. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppleEvent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0ops2bVPvl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0ops2bVPvl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IisHHU"&gt;Rumors suggest that the same M1X processor will feature in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;redesigned higher-end Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The new machine will reportedly have more ports than last year’s M1 model, with two Thunderbolt / USB 4 Type-C ports and two USB Type-A ports. The changes should make the new Mac Mini much better suited to power users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlrkgz"&gt;Finally, Apple may announce a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;pair of redesigned AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, representing the third generation of the company’s original true wireless earbuds. The AirPods are expected to adopt a design similar to the AirPods Pro, with shorter stems and a redesigned charging case. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says it’s dropping Material Design components on iOS in favor of Apple’s UIKit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_d2JPeeoLspqwU5NWsblSUfPouE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69982999/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EtzZAf"&gt;Google is phasing out its use of Material Design user interface components for its iOS apps in favor of leaning more on Apple’s own UIKit. The company says the result of the switch should be less work for its iOS development team, but, more importantly, it’s likely the change will mean that Google’s iOS apps will feel less like interlopers on Apple devices. Instead of obeying Android’s UI conventions, they should look and feel more like they belong on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZafr9"&gt;The change was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/featherless/status/1446151509549387781"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; by Jeff Verkoeyen, engineer lead for Google Design on Apple’s platforms. I recommend reading the full thread if you’re interested, but Verkoeyen says his team “shifted the open source Material components libraries for iOS into maintenance mode” earlier this year. Material Design is Google’s in-house set of design conventions, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5841044/material-design-new-google-interface-2014"&gt;introduced in 2014&lt;/a&gt; in order to unify the look and feel of its apps and services across mobile devices, Chrome OS, and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8w0gsG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This year my team shifted the open source Material components libraries for iOS into maintenance mode. Why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A  ...&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Verkoeyen (@featherless) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/featherless/status/1446151509549387781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="lRkPxb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This evolution of how we approach design for Apple platforms has enabled us to marry the best of UIKit with the highlights of Google's design language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The result? Many custom components simply aren't needed anymore. And the ones that are, they now get more attention and focus.&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Verkoeyen (@featherless) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/featherless/status/1446151524934107137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Dyg4Zp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The time we're saving not building custom code is now invested in the long tail of UX details that really make products feel great on Apple platforms. To paraphrase Lucas Pope, we're "swimming in a sea of minor things", and I couldn't be more excited about this new direction.&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Verkoeyen (@featherless) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/featherless/status/1446151530508398596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wzR3QC"&gt;Verkoeyen said Google developed its own Material Design components for iOS, but, over time, found that these have been “slowly drifting further and further from Apple platform fundamentals because those fundaments were also evolving year over year.” Instead of creating work for itself by filling those gaps, Verkoeyen says Google has now decided to use Apple’s own UIKit for it iOS apps. He notes that doing so will “result in much tighter integrations with the OS than what we can reasonably achieve via custom solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6phvRk"&gt;Verkoeyen’s phrasing is somewhat oblique here, but many are &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2021/10/googles-apps-to-embrace-ios-on-ios/"&gt;interpreting&lt;/a&gt; the thread — including that mention of “tighter integrations” — as meaning that Google’s iOS apps will, in the future, follow more of the design conventions of Apple’s mobile OS. That might mean using fewer custom buttons that look like they belong on Android, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCt1qG"&gt;As long-time Apple journalist Jason Snell &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2021/10/googles-apps-to-embrace-ios-on-ios/"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;: “This is good news. It’s good for Google’s developers, who no longer have to build that custom code. And more importantly, it’s good for people who use Google’s apps on iOS, because with any luck they’ll be updated faster, work better, and feel more like proper iOS apps, not invaders from some other platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp3l8A"&gt;The proof of the pudding is in the eating, though, and until Google actually starts updating it iOS apps over the coming years, we won’t really know how it plans to marry the two design approaches. Let’s hope it does the right thing, and just makes things easiest for users. We will see.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C port on an iPhone X.&lt;/em&gt; | Ken Pillonel (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAekbJf4Gsw" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VfmGgU"&gt;Apple hasn’t created a USB-C iPhone despite years of rumors, but that hasn’t stopped a robotics engineering student from creating one. Ken Pillonel has placed a working USB-C port inside an iPhone X, allowing the phone to charge and transfer data over USB-C instead of Lightning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTV91e"&gt;Pillonel has spent months on the project in his spare time, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/11/iphone-gets-usb-c-thanks-to-creative-robotics-engineer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and opened up plenty of USB-C and Lightning cables to get to his final goal of a USB-C iPhone. Pillonel originally created &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCEzdj_8YwU"&gt;a simple prototype&lt;/a&gt; in May that allowed an iPhone battery to be charged over the USB-C port. The proof of concept was rather large and didn’t fit inside an iPhone, so the next stage was to remove all the wires and squeeze it inside. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZW5bEZwG-y8Mu1A5XrwHbW8zQec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920198/usbciphone.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Ken Pillonel (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAekbJf4Gsw" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C port on an iPhone X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2IOb6v"&gt;Pillonel reverse-engineered Apple’s custom C94 connector, creating his own flexible PCB design that fits inside an iPhone. Pillonel revealed the flexible cable in a final teaser video this week, demonstrating how the iPhone X with USB-C charges and transfers data. A full video is currently being edited, which will detail exactly how Pillonel managed to reverse-engineer the C94 connector and fit his custom PCB inside the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAzNxU"&gt;The USB-C iPhone comes just weeks after the European Commission announced plans to force smartphone and other electronics manufacturers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;fit a common USB-C charging port&lt;/a&gt; on their devices. Apple could be forced to create an iPhone with USB-C in the next couple of years, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"&gt;launch a portless iPhone&lt;/a&gt; that relies on wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BiVcz"&gt;It’s not clear whether Pillonel plans to release details of his custom flexible PCB so others can attempt the modification. He’s currently studying for a master’s degree in robotics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, EPFL. He has previously used his talents to &lt;a href="https://kenp.io/galaxy_fold_car/"&gt;modify a car mount for Samsung’s Galaxy Fold&lt;/a&gt;, releasing a 3D printed mod to allow a Xiaomi Mi Wireless Car Charger to work with the Galaxy Fold.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $850.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release later this year — and we’ll highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5M7S6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $850. The $1,249 512GB configuration is also on sale in all three colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,100, its best price to date. These deals can come and go quickly, though, we expect more to come as the holiday shopping season draws near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The touch bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s geared more toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $120 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,179. The larger, 512GB variant is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $1,349, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjmE4B"&gt;While there have been rumors throughout the year of a r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/9/22526584/apple-m1x-macbook-pro-wwdc-2021-youtube-tags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;edesigned MacBook Pro, one with an M1X processor and additional ports&lt;/a&gt;, we might not see it until further into the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch, mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Windows bootcamp-ready Ice Lake processors, the current scissor-switch keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in several configurations at Amazon, including one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th-gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999 and one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th-gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,700, which is $300 off the list price. You can also pick up the model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage and a 10th-gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; for $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. There are several configurations available with more storage and speedier processors — you can also get the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FTNGNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,695 at Amaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, for instance — but deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $799&lt;/a&gt;. B&amp;amp;H Photo is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;matching Amazon’s current price&lt;/a&gt; for the 512GB model, though, no other retailers are at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 15.0.2 with some Find My fixes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJ0CrmeKrfc3RniV9709J3cIJ0s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69980678/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fu32v"&gt;Apple released iOS 15.0.2 on Monday, and it has some important bug fixes, including a couple specific to Find My. For the iPad and iPhone, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212846"&gt;it also fixes a security flaw&lt;/a&gt; that Apple says may already be under attack, so update ASAP. Credited to an anonymous researcher, CVE-2021-30883 could allow an attacker to exploit the IOMobileFrameBuffer to “execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges,” and take over your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhHCdF"&gt;On my iPhone 12 Mini, the update clocks in at 531.1MB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8yv5S"&gt;Here are the patch notes from Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FopdTk"&gt;This update includes bug fixes for your iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3MJUf"&gt;Photos saved to your library from Messages could be deleted after removing the associated thread or message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5CT2w"&gt;iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe may not connect to Find My&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMpUfp"&gt;AirTag might not appear in the Find My Items tab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7QEnL"&gt;CarPlay may fail to open audio apps or disconnect during playback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0DXbL"&gt;Device restore or update may fail when using Finder or iTunes for iPhone 13 models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="J3QrME"&gt;iPadOS 15.0.2 is also out. Here’s what’s included in that, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/11/ios-15-0-2-release-bug-fixes-features/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="g9dGNd"&gt;Photos saved to your library from Messages could be deleted after removing the associated thread or message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viecq8"&gt;AirTag might not appear in the Find My Items tab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZHtKI"&gt;Device restore or update may fail when using Finder or iTunes for iPad mini (6th generation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MFXd1s"&gt;Apple released iOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;on September 20th&lt;/a&gt;, and already updated it once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704524/apple-ios-15-0-1-update-fix-iphone-13-watch-unlock-bug"&gt;to iOS 15.0.1&lt;/a&gt; to fix an issue where people couldn’t use their Apple Watch to unlock their iPhone 13 while wearing a mask. Apple is also testing iOS 15.1 in beta, which currently includes features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686897/ios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card"&gt;SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, support for adding a COVID-19 vaccination card to Apple Wallet, and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713135/iphone-13-camera-features-prores-macro-ios-15-1-beta-3"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro camera features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juV9qt"&gt;Apple posted watchOS 8.0.1 on Monday, too. According to Apple, here’s what’s fixed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jXq4WQ"&gt;Software update progress may not be displayed accurately for some Apple Watch Series 3 users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aelWgd"&gt;Accessibility settings may not have been available for some Apple Watch Series 3 users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jKrbSj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is appealing the Epic Games ruling it originally called a ‘resounding victory’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rw1L-2fRK2yD6eV4lSRtlNc_Ofs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69972129/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple is appealing the Epic Games ruling | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HXBaCg"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;potentially billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; and some control over the App Store at stake, Apple has filed for an appeal of the ruling in its major trial against Epic. While Apple largely won that case (the company went so far as to call the ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling"&gt;a “resounding victory”&lt;/a&gt;) with Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruling in favor of Apple in nine of the ten claims Epic brought against the company, it did lose in one important way: the judge found that Apple violated California’s anti-steering rules, and demanded that Apple let developers link to outside payment systems. That policy would have taken over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, but it may be pushed out beyond that — and it seems that’s the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzMH0j"&gt;As part of the appeal, Apple is asking for a stay to prevent the company from having to implement the new anti-steering rules, arguing that it “will allow Apple to protect consumers and safeguard its platform while the company works through the complex and rapidly evolving legal, technological, and economic issues.” And the company’s arguments there are pretty revealing if we’re reading the document right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yxijeu"&gt;For instance, Apple claims that the new anti-steering rule is unnecessary because the company had already agreed to delete the offending section of its App Store Guidelines in the &lt;em&gt;Cameron v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;settlement, but that’s news to us: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt;, Apple only agreed to “clarify” that app developers were allowed to communicate with consenting customers, not link to outside payment systems. That clarification was widely seen by developers as a red herring. At the time, Apple didn’t say anything about deleting a section of its App Store Guidelines entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yPUaOe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple and Epic both lost today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling"},{"title":"The future of the App Store depends on the difference between a ‘button’ and an ‘external link’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"},{"title":"What comes next for the App Store?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671574/epic-apple-app-store-new-rules-meaning-ruling-decision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fPZLBZ"&gt;It also seems like Apple is genuinely afraid that the court order &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; force them to open up the App Store to alternate payment mechanisms, despite what some Apple pundits have claimed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;A button might actually be a button&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="32fHay"&gt;Links and buttons to alternate payment mechanisms are fraught with risk. Users who click on a payment link embedded in an app—particularly one distributed through the curated App Store—will expect to be led to a webpage where they can securely provide their payment information, email address, or other personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2k0SHS"&gt;Apple goes on to argue that if it were forced to allow app developers to link to external payment systems, it wouldn’t be able to protect users from fraud: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="07eXrO"&gt;While Apple could examine the links in the version of the app submitted for review, there is nothing stopping a developer from changing the landing point for that link or altering the content of the destination webpage. Additionally, Apple currently has no ability to determine whether a user who clicks on an external link actually received the products or features she paid for. Apple already receives hundreds of thousands of reports each day from users, and allowing links to external payment options would only increase this burden. In essence, the introduction of external payment links, particularly without sufficient time to test and evaluate the security implications, will lead to the very same security concerns that Apple combats with the use of IAP more generally, which the Court agreed were legitimate, procompetitive reasons for the design of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9GgANe"&gt;There are a number of open questions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;about how well Apple protects App Store users&lt;/a&gt; — it was only this past week that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;added a feature to easily report obvious App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67W2hL"&gt;The company even cites a blog post from (and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s story about) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714677/apple-in-app-payment-competitor-paddle-epic-ruling"&gt;Paddle, a would-be rival to Apple’s in-app payments that emerged after the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt;, using it to illustrate one possible threat to consumers. Not because of its lower fees, of course, but because “In contrast to Apple’s strict rules surrounding privacy, that developer intends to provide access to user email addresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSOivG"&gt;Other arguments are raised as well, which you can read in full in the document embedded at the bottom of this post. Overall, the company says that the “precipitous implementation of this aspect of the injunction would upset the careful balance between developers and customers provided by the App Store, and would irreparably harm both Apple and consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCH4s7"&gt;Apple also cites a previous case, &lt;em&gt;Ohio v. AmEx&lt;/em&gt;, as evidence that transaction platforms like the App Store can promote competition despite steering restrictions. (AmEx doesn’t double as a software marketplace, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ay66qJ"&gt;It’s important to note that Apple has only filed for appeal; we don’t know if the court will grant the appeal — and the stay— just yet. When the ruling originally hit in in September, Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt; that it hadn’t decided whether to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xc5yqh"&gt;For its part, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"&gt;Epic announced its intent to appeal&lt;/a&gt; on the same day Judge Gonzalez Rogers issued her order and permanent injunction against Apple. It was clear from the beginning that Epic wasn’t happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nQVyH"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney issued his response to the appeal, and it’s pretty much what you’d expect: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wDiEtX"&gt;
