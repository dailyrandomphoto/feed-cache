    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5KVNDf"&gt;If you’re lucky enough to have unwrapped a new iPhone as a holiday gift this year, you’ll probably want to install some new apps on it. Fortunately, we’re here to help with some suggestions. We’ve included great apps that are just generally fun or useful to have on your phone, and apps that you should download to replace the default ones that Apple ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4WfKA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used games, apps, and entertainment. Check out our app picks for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951417"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942553"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android phones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21943103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21952855"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M1-equipped Macs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; our favorite mobile games from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942272"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21934070"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and our top choices for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929534"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gaming PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941056"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929530"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox One and Series X / S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21938238"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We’ve also listed our favorite streaming shows on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178393/disney-plus-hulu-espn-plus-best-shows-movies-recommendations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175140/best-netflix-shows-2020-streaming-recommendations-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; some &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951428"&gt;&lt;em&gt;great sci-fi books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163667/2020-favorite-best-podcasts-tech-culture-apple-google-stitcher-soundcloud-spotify"&gt;&lt;em&gt;exciting new podcasts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. (Note: pricing was accurate at the time of publishing but may change.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i8kcAu"&gt;Widgetsmith&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Widgetsmith" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZZPBGFqsKZGX5S79l307TcK7A4I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22181017/widgetsmith.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Widgetsmith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xj3tPk"&gt;With iOS 14, Apple made it easier to customize the way your iPhone looks, offering new widgets and easier methods for setting custom application icons. One of the biggest names around when it comes to iPhone widgets is Widgetsmith, which lets users add photos, text, quotes, and more. Combine it with some clever icon swaps (now easier than ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;in the latest iOS update&lt;/a&gt;) and the right wallpaper, and you’ve got the customized iPhone of your dreams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dkkQGT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Widgetsmith","description":"Free from the App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widgetsmith/id1523682319"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="RuMHMi"&gt;Libby&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Libby" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4PhnwvZ3fRmx3EuW-ON3A3RYzx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22181016/libby.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Libby&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eUey65"&gt;It’s tough to make it out to libraries right now, but if you’ve got a smartphone, you can get to the next best thing: Libby, which lets you borrow ebooks and audiobooks from your local library for free right from your phone. Plus, the app itself is a great digital reading app in its own right, so you can enjoy books even without a dedicated device like a Kindle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uEnlb1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Libby","description":"Free from the App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/libby-by-overdrive/id1076402606"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Jv9c7q"&gt;TikTok  &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="TikTok" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Jh5mAJIbw11wUyINn_BAXNs5Cc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542053/tiktok.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dMB0ln"&gt;TikTok has exploded in popularity in 2020 to become one of the biggest social media networks on the planet, with everything from internet memes, comedy sketches, and even a full-fledged &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical. In other words, it’s the most fun place on the internet right now. Add in an algorithm that seems to almost magically show you videos perfectly tailored to your interests, and you’ve got almost endless content to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="alwuTU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"TikTok","description":"Free from the App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id835599320?mt=8"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="0Pmrat"&gt;Tweetbot&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tweetbot " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gl332awjktISm0Iy6Bb2EryV0u0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542054/tweetbot.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tweetbot&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Iwt0zO"&gt;Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service / entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZnWF7H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Tweetbot","description":"$4.99 from the App Store","label":"Buy now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-5-for-twitter/id1018355599"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Ax7ugh"&gt;Paprika Recipe Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Paprika Recipe Manager " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwOgHFVcW_-bIEZPt7CRaWzz6h8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542055/paprika.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paprika Recipe Manager &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Igj0u1"&gt;The internet is basically the best cookbook ever made, with recipes for whatever dish, dessert, or drink you want to create just a click away. Paprika lets you paste in links for those recipes, pulls out the crucial information (ingredients, directions, servings) from the sometimes endless stories and histories that food blogs insist on including, and saves the info in your own digital cookbook to pull up whenever you need it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="d41xW0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Paprika Recipe Manager","description":"$4.99 from App Store","label":"Buy now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222868?ls=1"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="2hwDNs"&gt;Halide Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Halide Camera " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SY6Y4zJeOkbjcKOJEohB97lvx-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542087/halide.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halide Camera &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mxn5Rv"&gt;The cameras on the new iPhones are better than ever before, and a lot of that is thanks to the helpful AI-powered algorithms that work to perfect your shots. If you have a little more photographic know-how, though, you might want an app like Halide, which is designed to let you push the cameras to the limit. It also supports all the latest features of Apple’s new iPhones, including the iPhone 12 Pro’s ProRAW format, perfect for taking your photography to the next level. With an annual subscription, it’s not free, but if you’re big on iPhone photography, it’s worth the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5DKhPa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Halide Camera","description":"$11.99 / year from the App Store","label":"Buy now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide/id885697368"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="NwFZ2y"&gt;Darkroom &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Darkroom " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilglCwjREQw02xgoYyJYFv34ewE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22181015/darkroom.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Darkroom&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Na7S7W"&gt;Of course, photography is only half the equation. Editing is just as important (if not more so), and Darkroom is one of the best apps around, with support for RAW and ProRAW photos, along with the option to edit photos in batches. Best of all, it’s free, although there’s also a monthly subscription option for additional features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u8bcak"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Darkroom","description":"Free from the App Store / add-ons available","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/darkroom-photo-video-editor/id953286746#?platform=iphone"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="4FftIk"&gt;Authy&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Authy " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yVFCmEYTwgnQoCxf2oOFm3YlZbo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542091/authy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Authy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GwEEA5"&gt;Security time! Do you secure your internet accounts with two-factor authentication? If so, great; Authy is the app you’ll want to use for authentication codes. If not, &lt;em&gt;go set up two-factor authentication now! &lt;/em&gt;And when you do, use Authy, which does a better job of storing and keeping track of all those authentication codes than other apps like Google Authenticator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7LvcxA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Authy","description":"Free from the App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fd9JfP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Xcwsih"&gt;Lastpass / 1Password&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lastpass / 1Password   " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/esBWRXFZ_52HWbM3LsRISI9yDCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542085/lastpass.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Lastpass / 1Password&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qmxWHA"&gt;Speaking of internet security, you should probably start using a password manager instead of just entering the same password for all your accounts. LastPass and 1Password are the two best options around, each with different pros, cons, and costs. Setting up a new phone is the perfect time to set up some more security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qoxSxU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"LastPass","description":"Free from the App Store; $3 / month for premium version","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/app/id324613447"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="SpjtOY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"1Password","description":"Free from the App Store; $3.99 for premium version","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="H0NvD1"&gt;Microsoft Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Outlook " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzvMjIgJSETmWx4bgC88We31gcA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13172091/akrales_180927_2985_0064.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Outlook &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TTek0s"&gt;Apple’s default Mail app for email is still just plain bad. The UI is unwieldy, and support for Gmail is still poor enough that you should install a different email app instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911432/best-email-app-ios-android"&gt;Outlook for iOS is still one of the best options around&lt;/a&gt;, with useful features, a fast UI, and Microsoft support that means it’ll be around for years to come. Plus, with iOS 14, you can even set it to replace Apple’s app as the default option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oNYUph"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Microsoft Outlook","description":"Free from the App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="lGEolh"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Maps " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5mz8gtp2AGnSxX5tbpb6tCVCvt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9783729/DSCF2501__1_.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Maps &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LWd5Xn"&gt;Apple Maps isn’t bad these days, truth be told. But that doesn’t matter. Odds are that you will move it to a folder and use Google Maps anyway, because you’re the kind of person who doesn’t like getting lost on your way to wherever it is you’re going. Sometimes, you just can’t beat the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q5gmdz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Google Maps","description":"Free from the App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps-transit-food/id585027354"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="2rgnec"&gt;Venmo &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Venmo stock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v9-6N-kT6kOq4iebpmHnYl5OJLM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6404477/venmo1_2040.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Venmo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venmo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tgXN8w"&gt;Whether you’re splitting the internet bill with roommates or splitting a tab at a bar (whenever bars are open again), everyone has to pay someone else back at some point. Venmo makes it simple, easy, and secure — and unlike Apple Pay, it works on things that aren’t iPhones, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YzxoWd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Venmo","description":"Free from the App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/venmo/id351727428"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="BQdWyp"&gt;Google Photos &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Photos  " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DkCL6tzK2Pc3AL8ihi1RALPdvWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542082/photos.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Photos  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oWQ8h5"&gt;Apple Photos is the default photo app, and you’ll likely never replace it, since that’s where all the photos you take automatically go. Google Photos is ending its unlimited storage starting on June 1st, 2021, so it won’t back up &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your pictures and videos for free anymore. But it’ll still offering 15GB (on top of any pictures and videos you’ve already uploaded). That’s way more than Apple’s default 5GB iCloud storage, so it’s better than no backup at all. And when it comes to all your favorite pictures, why take the risk? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zSxbn3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Google Photos","description":"Free from the App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-photos/id962194608"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="LKNgFa"&gt;Fantastical &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fantastical 2  " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6lxfrVZR1QHMmyyehrmlvU8iyF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542057/fantastical.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantastical 2  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LACGc4"&gt;Apple’s default Calendar is fine for basic tasks, but if you want something a little more powerful, get Fantastical. Now free (with additional features available for a new subscription), you’ll get a UI that’s far more useful on a phone screen than Apple’s own, along with Fantastical’s excellent contextual cues that can automatically add details like dates or locations when you’re adding new events. It also has a truly excellent widget that’s far better than the default calendar app’s — something that’s especially useful with iOS 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="alp9s1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Fantastical","description":"Free from App Store","label":"Buy now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id718043190"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="YLj7r0"&gt;Otter &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Otter " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mR91wTSBqb4F6SNrtENSoYCwemk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542059/otter.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Otter&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U0M5zL"&gt;This is a bit of a niche category, but if you record a lot of voice notes on your iPhone (maybe you’re a student who wants to play back lectures or a technology reporter who needs to interview people from time to time), then you’ll want Otter.ai. It’s an AI-powered voice recording app that transcribes as you talk and stores it all in the cloud to access from anywhere. There are a few limits on the free version — you can only record 40 minutes at a time and up to 600 minutes per month — but it’s still a useful tool to have. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple iCloud sign-in and activation issue appears resolved after nearly 36 hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_oFZBwK5m1cCpRxkJQIB6ZiQaFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68581835/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zHsh6R"&gt;To all of you who got a new Apple device for Christmas, congrats! But you might have had some difficulty setting up and signing in to iCloud along with other Apple users. First reported by &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/25/apple-icloud-account-and-sign-in-issue-causing-device-activation-setup-problems"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as of Saturday morning, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fsystemstatus%2F%3Fdown&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F26%2F22200371%2Fapple-icloud-sign-activation-down-support-iphone-home-pod#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;system status page&lt;/a&gt; was showing “some users affected” by an issue that began at around 4:45AM ET on December 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUSWbI"&gt;Nearly 36 hours later, the issue appears to be over. A status update at 4:35PM ET Saturday shows the issue as “resolved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzHJLI"&gt;The issue appeared to be affecting multiple devices. The system status page didn’t show issues with any other parts of iCloud or other Apple services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kgbu4V"&gt;Apple Support &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSupport/status/1342589400950173696?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Friday afternoon that it was aware of the issue, and said it was  “experiencing a high capacity at this time, which is impacting your ability to set up iCloud, please try back in a couple of hours.” The message was directed to a user trying to set up their mother’s new iPad and HomePod mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6PdJp8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We know your mom is eager to have everything working and appreciate you helping to set them up. We are experiencing a high capacity at this time which is impacting your ability to set up iCloud, please try back in a couple of hours. &lt;a href="https://t.co/waNYZdXpJm"&gt;https://t.co/waNYZdXpJm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Apple Support (@AppleSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSupport/status/1342603333115240450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 25, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XO89Jm"&gt;It’s still not clear how widespread the problem was, and Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s Mi 11 won’t come with charger after it mocked Apple for not including a charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="usb-c" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4afABpMoXadzmqhazbETaVO5wMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68582607/vlad-savov-computex-usb-c-2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BUpnOn"&gt;Lei Jun, the CEO of Chinese phone maker Xiaomi, has confirmed that its upcoming Mi 11 phone will not come with a charger, citing environmental concerns. While that’s a legitimate argument against providing yet another hunk of plastic that resembles all the other chargers people already have, Xiaomi joined other phone makers who poked fun at Apple a few short months ago for not including chargers with the iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ecpqdz"&gt;Jun made the &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4586340304035440"&gt;remarks on Chinese social media site Weibo&lt;/a&gt;, saying people have many chargers which creates an environmental burden, and therefore the company was canceling the charger for the Mi 11. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vkmWA_I81niQ3beqkCYh69Q7eP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22197594/xiaomi_ceo.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said on Weibo the Mi 11 would come without a charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VELlTf"&gt;Apple’s decision not to include chargers with the iPhone 12 was met with some derision, and competitors like Samsung reminded customers in an ad that charging bricks were “included with your Galaxy.” That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;Galaxy ad has apparently been deleted&lt;/a&gt;, however, as rumors continue to build that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317304/samsung-smartphone-chargers-2021-cost-environment"&gt;Samsung won’t include a charger&lt;/a&gt; with its upcoming Galaxy S21 phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZUB2e"&gt;Shortly after the iPhone 12 launch, Xiaomi tweeted that it “didn’t leave anything out of the box” for its Mi 10T Pro, adding a short video clip that shows a Mi 10T box with a charger inside. Perhaps the takeaway here is that companies should keep the marketing team in the loop about future product decisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BMHL89"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Don't worry, we didn't leave anything out of the box with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mi10TPro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Mi10TPro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ToqIjfVEQX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ToqIjfVEQX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1316299756260352006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQ81F4"&gt;There is, in fact, a strong environmental case for not including superfluous chargers with new phones, especially if the chargers are identical to the dozens of others most people already have. But it seems like as phone makers continue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;raising the price tags&lt;/a&gt; on their new devices, they’re somehow finding ways to give customers less — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12839758/apple-is-biggest-winner-from-killing-headphone-jack"&gt;no headphone jacks&lt;/a&gt;, no charging bricks — than they did in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXJMib"&gt;Is the next step to just do away with the box and hand over new phones to customers in bubble wrap, or maybe in paper bags? I guess we’ll find out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned that the iOS calculator has a scientific mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the iOS default calculator in landscape mode." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/icidNCMgqFS6XgLW-P9Fe2GxOdE=/622x0:2310x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574753/IMG_0369.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xh9hfo"&gt;Today I learned that the iPhone’s built-in calculator app has a scientific mode — and all you have to do to access it is turn your phone on its side. If you’re the type of person who keeps your phone permanently in portrait lock (like me), this might come as a surprise to you, as it did to many of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ehyfax"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;that glimpse of an alternate universe vibe when you turn your iPhone sideways and all of a sudden it’s a scientific calculator &lt;a href="https://t.co/PNxLVpXRAS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PNxLVpXRAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— J.R. Carpenter (@jr_carpenter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jr_carpenter/status/1341786812381941761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S0ItSy"&gt;This unlocks all sorts of functionality, like adding numbers to memory, parentheses, exponents, and all those trig functions from back in high school. The feature isn’t exactly new, or hidden: It &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-06-09-iphone-calculator-gets-scientific-in-2-0.html"&gt;was introduced in iOS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; back in 2008, and there’s actually even a screenshot of it on the App Store page for the calculator app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the App Store page for Apple’s Calculator app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-s6TgkXysrFCKxXjWex8Zszo8e8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22193835/IMG_0371.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was hiding in plain sight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O8rgx6"&gt;To be fair, most people probably never see that App Store page, as the app comes pre-installed on every phone. It’s not the first app that you’d probably look for if you wanted to install a new calculator, either — even with the hidden(ish) functionality, it’s still not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDF2M3"&gt;For starters, there’s no ticker tape feature, which lets you see all the operations you’ve just done, which is useful when you need to see if you’ve already added a value or not. It also makes some essential functions like parentheses — which I use in almost every math equation I do — hard to access.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of a calculator’s ticker tape function, which shows the previous numbers and functions. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZuCALofVyHQNd6KWC4FylPkAfYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22193842/IMG_0368.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is PCalc’s ticker tape function, which is invaluable to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y2aGlH"&gt;Thankfully, there are other options: &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc/id284666222"&gt;PCalc offers a more robust calculating experience&lt;/a&gt;, and offers a free &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite/id300311831"&gt;PCalc Lite&lt;/a&gt; version that’s also worth a download. Or for more serious math, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-MultiView-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B000PDFQ6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;there’s the TI-30XS&lt;/a&gt;, which can make some things (like fractions) so easy it almost feels like cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s deleting ads that mocked Apple for not including a charger in the box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xT9k5lmNZP2UHqlY_bVoNIBpos=/313x0:2188x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68573712/samsung_mocking_apple_no_charger_iphone_12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Samsung (via 9to5Google)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ESGDhC"&gt;Samsung has been caught deleting an ad that makes fun of Apple for not including a charging brick with the iPhone 12 — the same thing it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317304/samsung-smartphone-chargers-2021-cost-environment"&gt;rumored to be doing&lt;/a&gt; with its Galaxy S21 phones. The Facebook post was made by Samsung Caribbean back in October, and it had a picture of a charging brick with the caption “Included with your Galaxy” (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/23/samsung-apple-charger-removal-post/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Samsung ad including an image with a phone charging brick captioned “Included with your Galaxy”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zzJi48iA6W98DtXxi-fhFmTHg98=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22193430/samsung_charger_apple_ad_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung (via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Facebook post that has now been deleted, adding even more fuel to the rumors that Samsung won’t be including a charger with its upcoming phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sT6PeX"&gt;This isn’t the first time Samsung has deleted ads after adopting the same practice it previously mocked Apple for. Back when the Galaxy Note 10 launched without a headphone jack, Samsung &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/2019/08/08/galaxy-note-10-headphone-jack-is-dead-why-and-how-to-embrace-change/"&gt;deleted ads making fun of the iPhone X&lt;/a&gt; for not having a similar plug (ads that were made even more awkward by the fact that the iPhone in the ad was just referred to as the “ten”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iExgNc"&gt;None of this is to say that doing the same thing as Apple is necessarily a bad thing. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20758050/samsung-galaxy-note-10-headphone-jack-35mm-usbc-unpacked-event"&gt;had an explanation&lt;/a&gt; as to why it removed the headphone jack, and not including the charger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;could very well be good for the environment&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just not a great look when Samsung is posting ads about including a charger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;only a few months before&lt;/a&gt; it’s expected to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Px1gU"&gt;Despite the awkwardness that the marketing could cause, Samsung could handle this better than Apple did. When Apple removed the charging brick, they also changed the cable that came with the phone: almost every previous iPhone came with a USB-A brick, and the cable included in the iPhone 12’s box was USB-C to Lightning. So the argument of “everyone has a charging brick” fell flat because almost any previous iPhone bricks weren’t compatible with the included cable (though&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHJA3AM%2FA%2F20w-usb-c-power-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F23%2F22197394%2Fsamsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Apple would happily sell customers one for $20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UwMgA"&gt;Samsung’s phones, however, use standard USB-C cables for charging, as opposed to Apple’s proprietary Lighting. This means that the cable that comes with Samsung’s new phone will work with the charging brick that came with last year’s model (though it won’t help people who don’t buy new phones every year, as the Galaxy S10 from two years ago &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExI-hp7d-0g"&gt;came with a USB-A charging brick&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Apple refused a meeting to acquire Tesla </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/beKsBOVlF4bEAhx7gzEvX7Zuzms=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68568801/elon_musk_tesla_3225.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9IUnSd"&gt;Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1341485211209637889"&gt;said Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he wanted to sell Tesla to Apple during the “darkest days” of the Model 3 rollout but that CEO Tim Cook “refused” to take the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDEJ8h"&gt;Musk dished about the proffer in response to a tweet about how Apple has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194032/apple-car-self-driving-battery-tech"&gt;reignited its desire to make and sell an electric, autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt;. He noted that Tesla was worth about one-tenth then what it is now, as the electric vehicle company rounds out a remarkable year where a meteoric stock price run turned it into the most valuable automaker on the planet. Of course, in 2017 Tesla was still hemorrhaging money and had not yet produced an electric vehicle at high volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pq2LvF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1341485211209637889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L2NSEU"&gt;Musk has previously said that Tesla was “&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/elon-musk-tesla-death-bleeding-cash-a7928b06-3aae-43d7-bdde-5b9c41ef298f.html"&gt;single-digit weeks&lt;/a&gt;” away from collapse in 2017 as he directed all of the company’s resources toward ramping up production of the Model 3 sedan. Tesla ultimately survived, and has since gone on to roll out the Model Y SUV and announce new vehicles like the Cybertruck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpQq9K"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWr5h6"&gt;Apple has spent the last half-decade toying with an entry into the worlds of electric and self-driving cars, but up until this week was thought to be focused on developing software and other technologies that could be sold to other companies. But on Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194032/apple-car-self-driving-battery-tech"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Silicon Valley giant has retrained its focus on making an electric, autonomous car for general consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4lMlA"&gt;One of the reasons Apple reportedly changed directions again is that it has made progress on a potential breakthrough with regards to the battery. According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Apple has been developing a lithium iron phosphate battery that can be packaged more tightly in the car’s battery pack, cutting down on weight while increasing the potential energy density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUokFl"&gt;Musk pointed out on Twitter on Tuesday that Tesla is already using iron phosphate batteries in some of the cars it’s making in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjfwqH"&gt;“Strange, if true,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4IuKM"&gt;Tesla and Apple have swapped a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of talent over the last decade. When rumors of an “Apple car” first emerged in 2015, Musk joked that Apple was a “Tesla graveyard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPidhK"&gt;“If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/8/9484379/elon-musk-blasts-apple-interview"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaQ6B5"&gt;Musk said at the time that an electric car was “the next logical thing” for Cook and Apple to work on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0h7edm"&gt;“It’s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches,” Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2u7sUN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants to build its first car in 2024, Reuters says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yhU4W60hCQ5McMPuRNpxKJYdzMc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562849/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCaIgR"&gt;Apple once again appears to be seriously looking at making a car. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple is pursuing production of a passenger vehicle by 2024 as well as the creation of self-driving systems and a “breakthrough battery technology.” The report is vague on how it all comes together — it’s not clear that all of this tech is going into the first passenger vehicle Apple hopes to make — but it indicates that Apple is considering vehicle production, after previously shutting down plans to make a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co7fxC"&gt;There have been rumors of Apple developing a car going &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-titan-car-project-to-challenge-tesla-1423868072"&gt;back to 2015&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2016, the project was scaled down significantly, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/17/13303710/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-focus"&gt;development of a full car being scrapped&lt;/a&gt; and Apple’s team refocusing on providing software that could be licensed out to car manufacturers, according to reports at the time. Around 200 people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195598/apple-project-titan-200-employees-dismissed"&gt;were laid off&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s car team just last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TZo6Yh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are a lot of vague details still, including whether this will actually happen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4qhcXN"&gt;Now it seems that Apple has renewed its focus on building an actual vehicle — though there’s a lot of uncertainty on when (and even if) it will happen. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;says 2024 is the production goal for an Apple-made passenger vehicle, though it could be pushed back “into 2025 or beyond” because of pandemic-related delays. There is also still a chance Apple could scale its efforts back to just autonomous driving tech, the report warns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHKZEu"&gt;The report says that Apple is relying on third parties to provide some components of its self-driving tech, including its LIDAR systems. Apple’s battery technology reportedly relies on a “monocell” design that allows more capacity to be fit into the overall battery unit by not dividing it up into discrete cells. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports that it could allow for “a potentially longer range” and lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAvXzX"&gt;Apple declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GuZwn"&gt;If Apple is planning to manufacture a self-driving car, it may also face regulatory hurdles before it can hit the road. There are no true self-driving vehicles available today, though some cars, like those from Tesla, offer a degree of advanced driver assistance driving in certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrVaW"&gt;Earlier this month, Apple handed control of its self-driving car project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;over to John Giannandrea&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s head of AI. Giannandrea was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17195076/google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-joining-apple-machine-learning-siri"&gt;brought on board&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 to work on Siri, after previously working at Google as head of search and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzA2Mv"&gt;Just yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/20/sketchy-report-says-apple-car-coming-2021/"&gt;another report&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;em&gt;Economic Daily News&lt;/em&gt; in Taiwan, said that an Apple-made car could be released as soon as 2021 in what would be a stunningly ambitious timeframe if true. Back in 2018, reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted the launch of a car between 2023 and 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/14/ming-chi-kuo-apple-car-2023/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, though, the impression has been that Apple was focused on self-driving technology for the past several years, rather than production of an actual Apple-branded vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe releases Apple Silicon version of Premiere Pro in beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1pSOOnlCu8CTFOf7nfR1F0j2pY=/0x0:749x499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559369/PPro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r6qYc8"&gt;Adobe has released an Arm version of Premiere Pro for macOS, allowing owners of new Apple Silicon M1 Macs to run the video editing software natively. The program is still very much in beta for now, however, and the &lt;a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-beta/discuss-premiere-pro-on-apple-silicon-m1/td-p/11691346?page=1"&gt;Adobe post announcing its availability&lt;/a&gt; lists a host of known bugs and missing features. News of its release was &lt;a href="https://the8-bit.com/adobe-premiere-pro-for-m1-macs-now-available-to-public-beta-testers/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The 8-Bit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/premiere-pro-premiere-rush-audition-for-m1-beta/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; adds&lt;/a&gt; that Adobe’s Premiere Rush and Audition have also been updated to run on the new machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkSxYy"&gt;Adobe says it’s porting Premiere Pro’s features over in phases, starting with its core editing functions and workflows, as well as popular codecs like H.264, HEVC, and ProRes. Third-party integrations will need to be updated by their respective developers to work on Apple Silicon. Adobe advises that users can run the current release version of Premiere Pro on M1 Macs using Rosetta 2 emulation while the Arm version is still in development, though some third-party integrations may not work in this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaQRE2"&gt;Premiere Pro joins other Adobe apps including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571070/adobe-photoshop-arm64-beta-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162930/adobe-lightroom-arm64-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Lightroom&lt;/a&gt; that have seen releases for Apple’s new Arm-based Macs. It’s a relatively quick turnaround for Adobe considering the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini were only released just over a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dozens of Al Jazeera journalists targeted in apparent iOS spyware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CbJr-LdQ9t6mMic2yNHFwEeQFas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559162/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QGHkvY"&gt;36 personal phones belonging to Al Jazeera journalists, producers, anchors, and executives were hacked in a spyware campaign between July and August 2020, &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/"&gt;a new report from Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt; alleges. The attacks reportedly used Pegasus technology provided by the Israeli firm NSO Group, and are thought to be the work of four operators. Citizen Lab says it has “medium confidence” that one is working on behalf of the UAE government and another for the Saudi government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1mZNr"&gt;The attacks are worrying not just because they appear to show politically-motivated targeting of journalists, but also because they’re part of a trend of using increasingly advanced methods that are harder to detect. According to Citizen Lab, the attacks seem to have used a zero-click exploit to compromise iPhones via iMessage, meaning the attacks happened without the victims needing to do anything, and leave much less of a trace once a device is infected. In July 2020, the exploit chain was a zero-day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="b4U0XN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS 14 is not thought to be vulnerable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xl91yS"&gt;Citizen Lab’s report says “almost all iPhone devices” which haven’t been updated to iOS 14 appear to be vulnerable to the hack, meaning the infections it found are likely to be a “miniscule fraction” of the total number. It has disclosed its findings to Apple, and the company is looking into the issue. Citizen Lab’s analysis suggests the spyware can record audio from a phone (including ambient noise and audio from phone calls), take photos, track location, and access passwords. Devices updated to iOS 14 don’t appear to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUvkiT"&gt;Citizen Lab discovered one of the hacks after Al Jazeera journalist, Tamer Almisshal, allowed the organization to install a VPN on his device because he was worried it might have been compromised. Using this software, Citizen Lab, noticed that his phone visited a suspected installation server for NSO Group’s spyware. Seconds later, his phone uploaded over 200MB of data to three IP addresses for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwYgD5"&gt;As well as the Al Jazeera employees, Citizen Lab reports that a journalist with Al Araby TV, Rania Dridi, was also the victim of hacks using NSO Group’s spyware. These attacks date back to October 2019, and appear to include two zero-day exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0MCsi"&gt;This is not the first time allegations have emerged that spyware from NSO Group has been used to target journalists. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/20/citizen-lab-nso-dozens-of-aljazeera-journalists-allegedly-hacked-using-israeli-firm-spyware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the software has allegedly been used to target journalists in Morocco, as well as political dissidents from Rwanda and Spanish politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ewhJZ"&gt;When contacted for comment a spokesperson for NSO Group told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Citizen Lab’s report was based on “speculation” and “lacks any evidence supporting a connection to NSO.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJTXOs"&gt;“NSO provides products that enable governmental law enforcement agencies to tackle serious organized crime and counterterrorism only, and as stated in the past we do not operate them,” the spokesperson said. “However, when we receive credible evidence of misuse with enough information which can enable us to assess such credibility, we take all necessary steps in accordance with our investigation procedure in order to review the allegations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhDZmC"&gt;As a result of its investigation, Citizen Lab is calling for more regulations over the use of surveillance technology, and for a global moratorium on its sale and transfer until safeguards are put in place to guard against its misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
