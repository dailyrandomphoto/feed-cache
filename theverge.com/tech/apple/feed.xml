    <title>Microsoft’s latest Garage app is for recording group transcriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D-qwf2FLYCwugkDOdoiMVp3s-2o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68904607/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Q0PhN"&gt;Microsoft’s newest Garage app, the company’s brand for more experimental apps, is Group Transcribe, which lets groups of people capture real-time collective meeting transcriptions using their phones. It’s available for free right now &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/group-transcribe/id1527145885"&gt;on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufnfWH"&gt;“This app uses a multi-device approach to provide real-time, high quality transcription and translation, so users can be more present and productive during in-person meetings and conversations,” Microsoft’s Lainie Huston &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fgarage%2Fblog%2F2021%2F03%2Fnew-garage-project-group-transcribe-helps-you-transcribe-and-translate-while-advancing-inclusive-speech-ai%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwWGa2"&gt;Here’s how it works. Everyone who wants to participate in the group transcription needs to download the Group Transcribe app. Then, one person kicks off a transcription, and they can invite others to join by sharing a five-letter conversation code, a QR code, or by joining the group transcription with nearby sharing over Bluetooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTUgwH"&gt;Then, the app will begin transcribing the group’s conversation, noting who said what. Group Transcribe can even also auto-translate things people say and show those translations in line as part of the transcription. Transcriptions are saved in the app so you can review or share them after a meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Xyr3L"&gt;Here’s a screenshot of what the transcriptions and translations look like:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-eXa2Yr5aAZ4ihLmJuST8_vyGs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342744/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uZDS7g"&gt;Microsoft suggests that each person participating in the meeting should use their own phone “within arm’s reach” to have “the highest quality experience.” And in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Ftranslator%2Fgroup-transcribe-faq%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft says Group Transcribe doesn’t have a limit to how many people can join a transcription, but it notes that the app works best for “in-person meetings [with] up to four people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDwh5E"&gt;Microsoft doesn’t require you to sign in with any sort of account to use the app — you just have to enter your name and your preferred language. The app does send data to the cloud as part of the transcription and speaker identification process, but Microsoft lets you choose whether you want to share meeting recordings with the company that it will use to help improve Microsoft’s speech recognition technologies. And if you’re making a group transcription, everyone in the group needs to have agreed to share recordings before one is shared with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="razzrZ"&gt;You can read more about the app and its privacy features in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Ftranslator%2Fgroup-transcribe-faq%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu reenables picture-in-picture mode for iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uNtJSzqC9AgW8pyvNnmoR0Mb2Hw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68899685/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xR9ZDv"&gt;Hulu has fully reenabled picture-in-picture support (PiP) on iOS, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/hulu-ios-14-picture-in-picture/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, which means half-watching network TV is once again possible for Hulu subscribers on iPhone and iPad devices. Hulu joins a collection of major streaming services that support the feature on iOS, leaving YouTube as the major exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ja70VW"&gt;PiP for iPhones was enabled for Hulu around iOS 14’s original release, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1364725362610045012?s=20"&gt;but it was later disabled&lt;/a&gt; to “work on a few updates to provide the best experience for our viewers,” Hulu said. Now that the feature is back, users can enable PiP mode by starting a show or movie and touching the PiP button to pop the video into a resizable, floating player.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TPLyeL_eZoStuGcFUipTJnmfLS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22340593/B10DEEF4_5290_42FD_ACC5_EF5B41A0FC22_1_201_a.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The picture-in-picture button inside Hulu’s app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tExGZC"&gt;Hulu joins services like Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Max in supporting PiP. All of those services now either feature a dedicated PiP button like Hulu or default to picture-in-picture if you swipe to the home screen while a video is playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYDk5g"&gt;YouTube remains the odd one out. Picture-in-picture is not allowed in Google’s official YouTube app for iOS. Paying for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium"&gt;YouTube Premium&lt;/a&gt; enables background play, but that only extends to audio on iOS. Google has also periodically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445912/youtube-videos-website-picture-in-picture-ios-14-google-apple-premium"&gt;disabled&lt;/a&gt; and reenabled PiP support for the web version of YouTube on iOS. As of October 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498327/youtube-picture-in-picture-web-safari-ios-14-chrome-background-playback"&gt;PiP was possible again&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn’t appear to work as of today. Right now, only iPhones running the iOS 14.5 beta can do PiP on the web version of YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/youtube-site-picture-in-picture-ios-14-5-beta/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llzwKo"&gt;If you’re curious how to get PiP set up on your own device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451195/apple-iphone-ipad-pip-picture-in-picture-how-to-use-youtube"&gt;check out &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s latest Mars rover has the same processor as an iMac from 1998</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WdyzQxGIpNdTBf-vhuyJR0P52e0=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68899353/25_feb_peserverance4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9hdibO"&gt;NASA’s brand-new Perseverance rover is the most advanced machine that’s ever landed on Mars. But when it comes to rovers, “state of the art” is a subjective term. Perseverance is running on none other than a PowerPC 750, a single-core, 233MHz processor with just 6 million transistors that’s most famous for powering the original “Bondi blue” iMac from 1998. It’s the same type of processor that NASA already uses in its Curiosity rover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDaHYt"&gt;That may seem like a waste to some. After all, even with the difficulty of buying computer parts these days, surely NASA&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;could have found the budget for something like Intel’s $500 &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/i9-processors/i9-10900k.html"&gt;Core i9-10900K&lt;/a&gt; CPU (with 10 cores and a max clock speed of 5.3GHz) somewhere in the $2.7 billion cost of Perseverance. But &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2269403-the-perseverance-rover-runs-on-processors-used-in-imacs-in-the-1990s/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;, such an advanced chip is actually a detriment to the unique operating conditions of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xquwjpUh81lOY2W3EQ4rOpBiC3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7009607/angled_original_imac_large_2x.0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bOIjEu"&gt;That’s largely because Mars’ atmosphere offers far less protection from harmful radiation and charged particles than Earth’s atmosphere. A bad burst of radiation can badly wreck the sensitive electronics of a modern processor — and the more complex the chip, the more can go wrong. Plus, at 138 million miles away, it’s not like NASA can just swap out the processor if things go sideways. Because of those conditions, Perseverance actually features two computing modules: one is a backup just in case something goes wrong. (A third copy of the module is also on board for image analysis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EBVbb"&gt;To make the system even more durable, the PowerPC 750 chip in Perseverance is a little different than the one in the old iMacs. It’s technically &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750"&gt;a RAD750 chip&lt;/a&gt;, a special variant that’s hardened against radiation and costs upwards of $200,000. The chip is popular for spacecraft, too: in addition to Perseverance and Curiosity, it also powers the Fermi Space Telescope, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/20/4752114/deep-impact-mission-ends-NASA"&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/a&gt; comet-hunting spacecraft, and the Kepler telescope, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkHqH5"&gt;While the processor may be weak compared to a modern smartphone or gaming PC, &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/brains/"&gt;NASA’s spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; for Perseverance notes that it’s far more powerful than earlier rovers like Spirit or Opportunity: its 200MHz clock speed is 10 times faster than those older rovers, and with 2GB of flash memory, it offers eight times the storage. (Rounding things out, Perseverance also has 256MB of RAM in case you were looking to build your own rover.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4laQzH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Linux has made it to Mars","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291324/linux-perseverance-mars-curiosity-ingenuity"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HSQ57a"&gt;But while the chip itself has been to Mars before, Perseverance features some new computer technology that’s debuting on the planet for the first time: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291324/linux-perseverance-mars-curiosity-ingenuity"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which powers the Ingenuity helicopter that will attempt to fly autonomously on Mars as part of Perseverance’s mission. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy’s creator is back with a classic RPG made of incredible handcrafted dioramas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APpQQNnF2Dz0Ac36UaeWd_sXP7U=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898185/1_4k.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hironobu Sakaguchi talks about his upcoming Apple Arcade game Fantasian&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Gkoetn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; has everything you’d expect from a new Hironobu Sakaguchi experience. The creator of the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series is once again making a roleplaying game that takes place in a lush fantasy world, features turn-based combat, and centers on a globe-spanning quest. There’s even a new soundtrack from famed composer — and frequent Sakaguchi collaborator — Nobuo Uematsu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNz5Qt"&gt;But what makes &lt;em&gt;Fantasian &lt;/em&gt;unique is clear from a single screenshot: the game world has a distinct vibe because it’s built from tiny, handcrafted dioramas. “We really wanted to capture that touch and feel, and unique charm, that is only found in these dioramas,” Sakaguchi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBDvfU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is developed by Mistwalker, a studio Sakaguchi founded in 2004, and is currently listed as “coming soon” to Apple Arcade. He says the concept began around three years ago when he and some collaborators replayed &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy IV&lt;/em&gt; for the first time in years. “Playing that game reminded me of how much I really adore that classic RPG genre, and renewed my interest in it,” Sakaguchi explains. “It made me want to go back to my roots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="pdgk8z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9guC7V_Cvdk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v4OJNS"&gt;The premise of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, even sounds like classic &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;. Here’s a snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="q35yQB"&gt;The tale begins in a realm governed by machines, in which Leo causes a massive explosion at a hybrid magic-tech factory, resulting in his memory loss. Following the one memory left to him — a vision of a young woman — he is transported to a dusty frontier town called En. There, he is reunited with the girl from his memory, Kina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cwph9L"&gt;In an effort to recover Leo’s memories and find their own destinies, the two set off on an adventure together. During their travels, Leo’s past is revealed bit by bit as are the many layers that make up the game world. Within this multi-dimensional universe, the balance of “Chaos and Order” becomes a key factor in the struggle for these realms and the machinations of the gods who wish to control them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qaIw9BjMGRnafoS9MLZnSWx9UrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339543/Fantasian.001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Mistwalker.&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The creation process from concept art to in-game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N53kN6"&gt;Mistwalker has released several RPGs over the years, including titles like &lt;em&gt;Blue Dragon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Last Story&lt;/em&gt;; in 2014 the team expanded to mobile with the &lt;em&gt;Terra Wars&lt;/em&gt; series. Sakaguchi says his goal with each new game, dating back to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, is to introduce some kind of innovation. In the case of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, new features like a mechanic that lets you banish enemies to another dimension to battle later so that you can explore without interruption, as well as combat skills based around aiming, are key selling points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58oep7"&gt;But the most obvious innovation is the way the game looks — and it was a lot of work. Every space you’ll explore in &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, including both interior and exterior locations, is actually a hand-made diorama. There are more than 150 of them in total, created by a team that included artists who worked on franchises like &lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/em&gt;. The process starts with concept art, and then the artists start building props and other elements of the diorama. Once completed, the set is photographed, turned into a 3D model, and transported into the game engine, where it can then be enhanced with effects like lighting or fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UA6Jvo"&gt;Sakaguchi says that the process was “very tedious” and forced the designers to approach their creations differently compared to a traditional video game. “You have to be very conscious and intentional with how you construct the environment, because unlike 3D CG where I can add another path or modify an environment later on, you don’t really have that flexibility,” he says. It also took the team a while to find a 3D scanning method that could show the models with enough fine details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtuVdw"&gt;While he admits that “I was sweating a few times during development,” Sakaguchi says that the painstaking process was necessary to achieve the look he desired. “You could argue, well, if you wanted to make dioramas, you could do a diorama-esque visual using all 3D models, and playing with the textures, or lighting, or shading perhaps. But instead we opted for a much more analog methodology,” he explains, adding that the team had to be “really careful” with post-processing, so as to not ruin the effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZqlTD"&gt;The handcrafted feeling was also well-suited to Apple Arcade, where many players will be controlling the game via touchscreens. “There’s an interesting synergy between touching something with your fingers and hands through the screen that has been created by these artisans by hand,” Sakaguchi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uopOHA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; will be playable on iOS, Mac, and Apple TV, and Sakaguchi says that, aside from the touch controls, the game hasn’t been tailored specifically to Apple Arcade. Instead, the goal was to create a console-like experience for mobile devices. He describes the game as “a really comprehensive RPG experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sOsMA2"&gt;Classic-style Japanese RPGs are having a resurgence of sorts, thanks in part to veteran creators either returning to or sticking by what they love. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17787902/dragon-quest-11-yuji-horii-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt; creator Yuji Horii started in 1986 and is still going strong&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287791/bravely-default-2-nintendo-switch-interview-square-enix"&gt;comparatively new series like &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default&lt;/em&gt; are designed explicitly to bring lapsed fans back to the genre&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a similar story for Sakaguchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMvO9b"&gt;“Let’s be honest, I’m in the latter chapters of my game development career, and each game can take years to go from conception to release,” he says. Because of this, he’s tackling projects that bring him “genuine joy” to work on. “I personally enjoy playing these types of games, and that is what brings me back to it,” he says of his long-standing connection to fantasy RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Os4wd4"&gt;Sakaguchi is also well-known for creating expansive universes, ones that often grow beyond just a single game. It started with &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; and continued through to &lt;em&gt;Terra Battle&lt;/em&gt;, which has already seen a sequel and spinoff, with more planned. Right now, that isn’t the goal for &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, which has been designed as a standalone experience, according to Sakaguchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rg6czJ"&gt;Whatever project comes next, Sakaguchi and the team at Mistwalker have to solve at least one problem first — figuring out what to do with &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;’s 150 painstakingly crafted dioramas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pTvsxp"&gt;“That’s actually one of the biggest challenges we’re facing right now, trying to figure out where to store these things,” he says. “I really don’t want to have to throw them away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGCVzp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s most affordable iPad is down to $299 at select retailers</title>
    <content type="html">

    <title>A folding iPhone could be coming in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The dual camera system on the iPhone 12." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nx66yCszvvh2QlUkxEAsrq_gBUI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68893636/vpavic_4243_20201018_0139.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FqJ72b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233644/foldable-iphone-apple-screens-report"&gt;Rumors about a folding iPhone&lt;/a&gt; are nothing new, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18228861/apple-iphone-kuo-rumor-ipad-ipod-touch-airpower-airpods"&gt;who has a very strong track record&lt;/a&gt;) is weighing in with information of his own: he says that Apple could be looking at a 2023 launch, and that the phone could have a screen between 7.5 and eight inches (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-foldable-iphone-2023/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;Previous rumors have suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the screen would be smaller, closer to the size of an iPhone 12 Pro Max.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKsKu9"&gt;There have been numerous reports about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233644/foldable-iphone-apple-screens-report"&gt;Apple prototyping a folding iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, but according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;, Kuo says that the product has “not yet officially kicked off.” Meanwhile, competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149866/royole-flexpai-2-hands-on-folding-phone"&gt;Royole&lt;/a&gt; have all released multiple foldable phones (though they’re mostly expensive and clearly early implementations of the tech). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7AoOv"&gt;According to Kuo, the screen will be iPad Mini-sized when folded out, so it seems as if Apple is going for the Galaxy Fold approach of having a regular-sized phone that folds out into a small tablet, rather than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Z Flip&lt;/a&gt; or Razr approach of having a compact folding phone. (This is a bummer to me, but it seems like the folding phablet approach is the most popular at the moment.) It’s unclear who would be making those folding displays — there have been rumors of Apple working with both &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/lg-apple-foldable-displays/"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryn334"&gt;While the rumors of a prototype and this report from Kuo indicate that Apple is indeed working on a folding phone, it’s not something to wait around for just yet. Kuo’s 2023 launch date is dependent on Apple being able to figure out “key technology and mass production issues.” As we’ve seen, folding phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;can be hard to get right&lt;/a&gt;. If Apple can do it, though, it could be in the position to do what it does best: adopt a technology after other companies have figured out the bugs and pitfalls, and release a product that seems polished in comparison. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple not switching to USB-C iPhones in the near future, according to Ming-Chi Kuo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aseZG706fOZnifbbxChyEiSldJo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892938/akrales_190522_3440_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hHAgyX"&gt;The dream of a USB-C iPhone may be dead, according to the latest research note from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The company reportedly has no plans to adopt USB-C on future iPhone devices or integrate a Touch ID sensor into the power button (two technologies that exist on Apple’s iPad hardware, like the 2020 iPad Air).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXXwNe"&gt;The report, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/01/iphone-not-migrating-to-usb-c-or-getting-touch-id-on-power-button-any-time-soon"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, explains the rationale behind Apple’s decision: “We believe that USB-C is detrimental to the MFi business’s profitability, and its waterproof specification is lower than Lightning and MagSafe,” according to Kuo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aWjFlS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 might finally bring a smaller notch and faster screens, Ming-Chi Kuo reports","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0XWYYV"&gt;Therefore, instead of a USB-C iPhone, Kuo suggests that Apple may jump straight to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;long-rumored portless iPhone&lt;/a&gt; that relies exclusively on wireless charging — and specifically, Apple’s MagSafe technology — to charge. MagSafe, in particular, would provide a neat solution to both of the concerns Kuo raises: by eliminating ports, MagSafe would be even more waterproof than even Lightning, and Apple still controls the MagSafe standard through its MFi program, ensuring it’ll be able to continue to reap the rewards of licensing fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KnBM7"&gt;However, Kuo also notes that Apple doesn’t think MagSafe’s ecosystem has reached the point where it can be relied on as the sole charging method for the iPhone. Instead, he predicts that Apple will continue to use its Lightning port “for the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmjx9A"&gt;Kuo’s report also shoots down another persistent rumor for future iPhones: the idea that Apple might introduce a Touch ID sensor in the power button, similar to the one it offered on last year’s iPad Air refresh. According to Kuo, there’s no timeframe for Apple to add that upgrade either. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;An earlier report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, notes that Apple is testing a Touch ID scanner integrated directly into the display for this year’s iPhone lineup, although whether it actually makes the cut remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZx0B2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;The entire report from Kuo&lt;/a&gt; contains far more information on Apple’s future iPhone lineup, including a smaller notch and faster refresh rates for this year’s iPhones, rumors of a hole-punch camera in 2022, and a potential eight-inch foldable iPhone that could launch as early as 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has reopened all of its US retail stores for the first time in nearly a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SHOPPING-ELECTRONICS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LoYFHbCa90XAyR7dKdfw8YLebB0=/0x0:3202x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892868/1230283678.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by DANIEL SLIM/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iCSRB7"&gt;Every Apple Store location in the US has reopened as of today, roughly two weeks prior to the anniversary of the first store closures due to the coronavirus pandemic that began on March 13th, 2020. The news, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/01/apple-retail-stores-us-all-reopened/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this morning, coincides with the last of Apple’s Texas retail stores reopening on Monday. Apple also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that all 270 US Apple Store locations are now open in some capacity for either in-store shopping or online order pickup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QP4Gd"&gt;This, of course, has no direct correlation with the rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US; Apple, in many cases, follows local health guidelines and has preemptively closed its retail stores in some instances. But it does signal that Apple feels confident in its restrictions on in-store shopping at certain locations and the safety measures it has put in place, which include mandated face masks and limited occupancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bjj7Yt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple first began closing its retail stores outside China on March 13th, 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0PhKUN"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook announced nearly a year ago that the company would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/14/21179542/apple-closing-retail-stores-march-27-coronavirus"&gt;close all of its retail locations outside of mainland China&lt;/a&gt; until the end of the month. At the time, Apple had been developing its COVID-19 mitigation strategy for its China network of stores, which had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/1/21117941/coronavirus-apple-china-close-stores-offices-outbreak"&gt;first started closing on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; prior to the coronavirus’ widespread outbreak in the US. On March 17th, Apple said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183792/apple-retail-stores-closed-coronavirus-indefinitely-iphone-locations"&gt;keep all retail stores outside China closed indefinitely&lt;/a&gt; as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLWtUW"&gt;What followed in the months after involved a complex mix of store openings and closures as Apple adhered to local and state health guidelines and also prioritized the safety of its own retail employees. In some cases, stores were opened in limited capacity only to close again later on, while others stayed shut for extended periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7LWYf"&gt;Apple began enacting its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/8/21252400/apple-us-stores-reopening-date-location"&gt;official reopening strategy in the US in early May&lt;/a&gt; and that carried on for months through the summer into the fall. Yet Apple has shown a willingness to act fast in responding to changing conditions. In December 2020, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22190895/apple-close-retails-stores-covid-19-london-california-pandemic"&gt;shuttered every store in California and London&lt;/a&gt; as case numbers surged through the holidays. Early last month, Apple temporally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22214203/apple-close-remaining-uk-apple-store-covid-19-lockdown"&gt;closed every store in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ie7Nz0"&gt;For a fascinating pair of infographics detailing the rate of Apple Store closures in the US from last March to today, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/01/apple-retail-stores-us-all-reopened/"&gt;check out &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;’s story here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$294 in gold&lt;/a&gt; or $300 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; (coupon applied).

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V9q5MF"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 5 was released in 2019 and was discontinued roughly a year after release once the Series 6 was announced. Similar to its successor, the Series 5 includes an always-on display, unlike the Apple Watch SE. It also includes the ability to take EKGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="i1kiM0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 5 review: the best smartwatch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20869098/apple-watch-series-5-always-on-screen-features-price-best-smartwatch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sfuj8N"&gt;It’s a bit tough to find this watch these days because it has been discontinued, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733684510526102382" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; currently has a ton of discounts on this Apple wearable with up to $300 in savings available with any purchase of a Series 5 including six months of Apple Fitness Plus at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="db57c9"&gt;The best deal we found is at $319, where you can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733684094435036455" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm Series 5 with a silver aluminum case&lt;/a&gt; with a black-and-white Nike band that supports GPS and cellular networks (if you pay for a monthly plan).

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 might finally bring a smaller notch and faster screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The large FaceID notch is still there, but it eventually feels normal." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AtFkoWMaJOGdfX1xjd7UOEG_Kc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892094/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6JlYgD"&gt;Apple’s 2021 iPhones might finally have a smaller notch and, for some models, faster refresh rate displays, according to a new note from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. He also shared rumored information about other upcoming iPhones, including when we could see a foldable phone from Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7OHVu"&gt;Let’s start with the iPhone launching this year, which we’ll call it the iPhone 13. Kuo says the iPhone 13 lineup will consist of the same models as the iPhone 12, meaning that despite &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/apple-iphone-12-mini-sales-slow-as-smaller-smartphones-lose-appeal-report-idUSKBN2A91N0"&gt;reports of poor sales of the iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, the smaller phone could still get a refresh this year (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The two iPhone 13 Pro models will also have 120Hz refresh rate screens thanks to LTPO display technology, according to Kuo, finally bringing the iPhone on par with many Android flagships’ high refresh rate screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NTmlca"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some iPhones may have a hole-punch display in 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c1BlUG"&gt;The iPhone 13 models will all have a smaller notch, Kuo says, though if you wish that Apple would do away with the notch entirely, you might have something to look forward to in 2022. Kuo reports that at least some of the 2022 iPhone models will move to a hole-punch display, which could be similar to many Android phones like Samsung’s Galaxy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;S21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;lineup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Google’s Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPImQU"&gt;However, in addition to a selfie camera, the iPhone’s notch currently contains components used for Apple’s Face ID biometric authentication system, and Kuo didn’t elaborate on if or how this rumored hole-punch display for iPhones could still pack in everything needed for Face ID. And if you’re dreaming of a iPhone with no visible notch or hole punch, Kuo says that Apple may launch a truly all-screen iPhone in the second half of 2023 at the earliest, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/01/kuo-apple-8-inch-foldable-iphone-2023/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQxNYY"&gt;Kuo also says the iPhone 13 devices will still have a Lightning port, will have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142381/qualcomm-x60-modem-5g-phones-faster-power-efficient-5nm-carrier"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X60 modem&lt;/a&gt; (which is a step up from the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/21/iphone-12-qualcomm-x55-modem/"&gt;X55 modem included in the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;), and will have larger battery capacities than the iPhone 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gOLusR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new iPhone SE could support 5G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F8d5qq"&gt;There’s also a new iPhone SE in the works that will support 5G and have an improved processor, according to Kuo (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-iphone-se-2022-5g/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This new SE is expected to have a similar form factor as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;current $399 model with a 4.7-inch screen&lt;/a&gt; and could launch in the first half of 2022, Kuo says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8vPLt"&gt;Kuo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229885/apple-iphone-5g-se-model-delay-size-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has a larger iPhone SE in the works that uses a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;which would be similar to the new iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds like the 5G-capable iPhone SE may be something different. Kuo said in the new note that “there is no visibility on the current schedule” for Apple to bring power button Touch ID (or, notably, USB-C) to iPhones, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/01/iphone-not-migrating-to-usb-c-or-getting-touch-id-on-power-button-any-time-soon"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the future of this rumored larger iPhone SE uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKXKdr"&gt;Apple is also working on a foldable iPhone with a 7.5- to eight-inch display that could launch in 2023, Kuo says. However, the project seems to be in a very early stage, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-foldable-iphone-2023/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;’ article about Kuo’s report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gwqkgo"&gt;A 2023 launch would be dependent on Apple being able to solve “key technology and mass production issues” this year. He says the product has “not yet officially kicked off,” so it appears to still be in the research stage and previous rumors have indicated Apple could still decide not to proceed with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rn8eA6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s early plans for a foldable iPhone, saying in January that the company “hasn’t solidified plans to actually launch” the new device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsAfAM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
