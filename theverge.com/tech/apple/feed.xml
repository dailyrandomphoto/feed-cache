    <title>Apple MacBook Pro 14 and 16 review: return to form</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s new pro laptops right the wrongs of the past half decade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1T949o"&gt;Let’s start simply: the new MacBook Pros with M1 Pro and M1 Max chips are incredible — the fastest laptops we’ve ever tested in some tasks, with some of the longest battery life we’ve ever seen. Apple’s big bet on moving away from Intel CPUs and AMD GPUs in favor of its own Apple Silicon chips is paying off in meaningful ways, and if you can afford one of these machines, you will be very happy with them. They’re great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQBber"&gt;That said, the new MacBook Pros are not without their quirks, and the Mac software ecosystem is still catching up to Apple Silicon in general and Apple’s pro hardware GPU ideas in particular. So things aren’t quite as simple as our first impression of the MacBook Air with an M1 chip last year — depending on your needs and the tools you use, the Mac software ecosystem might not let you actually get the most out of these machines for a while yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR96Q7"&gt;But make no mistake: the performance Apple has delivered with these machines combined with the battery life we’ve seen in our tests means that there’s a new standard in the industry — one that Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and every other laptop maker will be hard-pressed to reach anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4wYkT4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834286"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="tzzpM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834290"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3nktvm9VipSbg-OXh6bRe6D_G1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965897/akrales_211028_4820_0523.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new MacBook Pro 16 (left) and 14 have bright Mini LED displays that support Apple’s ProMotion 120Hz high refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qz1Ars"&gt;We reviewed three of the new MacBook Pros: a $4,399 16-inch model with an M1 Max processor with 32 GPU cores, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage; and 16- and 14-inch models with M1 Pros with 16-core GPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage that list for $3,099 and $2,899 respectively. These are expensive computers from the jump: even the base model 14-inch starts at $1,999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0wt43"&gt;The first thing you’re going to notice after you take a deep breath and spend the money is that these new MacBook Pros are much more substantial than the outgoing models. They’re bigger and heavier than previous MacBook Pros, and they are more squared off. The 16-inch is even just a little thicker than the older 16-inch MacBook Pro. Surprisingly, the extra thickness is mostly in the display — the actual body is only ever so slightly thicker than my old 16-inch Intel MacBook Pro, but you can really see it in the lid because it no longer tapers at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHZMWY"&gt;This is good news. Apple has made so many compromises in the name of thinness for so long that it was about time for the pendulum to swing back, and the extra thickness allows for better cooling and the return of some useful ports. On the right side, you’ve got a Thunderbolt 4 port, an HDMI port, and a full-size SDXC slot; on the left side, you’ve got two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a MagSafe power connector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XW1Zrh"&gt;The ports are wonderful, and I’m glad they’re back. A few people on our video team said the SD card slot is enough of a reason to upgrade all by itself. But be warned that the ports aren’t top-spec: it’s an HDMI 2.0 port, not 2.1, and the SD card slot is only UHS-II, not the faster UHS-III or SD Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A side profile of the MacBook Pro 16 showing its full-size SD card slot, Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port, and HDMI port." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iiNwvEfKeYRv7wxhPp-iD1CHHtQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965874/akrales_211027_4820_0121.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now departing Dongletown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1q3ONclBy-y1_pfbExaQRZSNPk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965886/akrales_211027_4820_0310.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro 16 can only fast charge with a 140-watt or higher charging brick connected to its MagSafe port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8vPQM9"&gt;So yes, the ports are definitely more convenient, and totally fine for most situations, but there are still reasons to visit dongletown. For example, macOS Monterey now supports variable refresh rate external displays using a Vesa standard called Adaptive-Sync, but Apple tells me you’ll need a Thunderbolt to DisplayPort dongle for that. I also ran into a strange bug where sending audio out over HDMI resulted in stuttering video and glitchy audio, which Apple says it is looking into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NA57lx"&gt;The MagSafe 3 connector is great, a true classic. It’s strong enough to drag the MacBook Pro along a desk if you pull it straight, but instantly disconnects if it’s yanked at an angle. I missed it terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ah0lIm"&gt;The confusion arises at the other end of the MagSafe cable, which is USB-C. You can charge all of these machines over USB-C using any of the ports, and you can fast charge the 14-inch MacBook Pro using a 100-watt USB-C adapter and a USB-C cable that supports that much power. But you can only fast-charge the 16-inch MacBook Pro using the Magsafe connector connected to a 140-watt-or-higher power brick — MagSafe is the only port that supports the newest high-power USB-C PD standard. The other ports do not. What’s more, there’s no indicator anywhere that you’re fast charging, so you just have to plug in and hope for the best. At this point, “plug in and hope for the best” is the unofficial USB-C slogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybkfPq"&gt;USB-C charging is overall one of the most confusing parts of the entire confusing USB-C ecosystem, and it appears Apple is using MagSafe as a way around it — the power adapters are still interchangeable, but you’ll definitely know if your cable supports fast charging because there’s a MagSafe connector on it. It’s smart, but after years of USB-C nonsense, it’s also just funny we’re back here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWDKt8"&gt;Lastly, there’s the keyboard, which is blessedly drama-free. Apple finally shed the hapless Touch Bar, added full-height function keys, and restrained itself from trying to reinvent anything else. It feels like every other scissor-switch Apple keyboard I’m used to, which is welcome news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUQkM8NMRqv5OHmXMCuIDgqk24U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965883/akrales_211027_4820_0244.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro’s display can reach up to 1,600 nits of brightness, but that’s localized to only HDR content. The rest of the time, the screen has a more standard 500 nits peak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Alv8cS"&gt;The displays in these new MacBook Pros are also all-new, and they are terrific. In fact, I like looking at these displays far more than I like looking at Apple’s own $5,000 Pro Display XDR. But as with the rest of the new MacBook Pros, there is complexity involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lUiHC"&gt;First, there’s the notch, which houses a 1080p webcam, the camera LED, the TrueTone light sensor, and the ambient light sensor at the top of the display. But to me, rather than thinking of the notch eating into the display, I think of the display getting larger except in that one spot. The MacBook Pro effectively has a 16:10 display with a little extra bit at the top where the menu bar and the notch live. You stop noticing it after just a few minutes, just like you stopped noticing the iPhone notch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ojoHG"&gt;If you hate the notch, there are already free utilities to black out the menu bar and hide it, and you’ll have the exact same display experience as any previous MacBook. So we promise: the notch is not worth overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xev9vn"&gt;That said, it can be a little odd in practice. There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143798251339778"&gt;already videos of weirdo notch bugs&lt;/a&gt;, which feels like what happens with every new iPhone notch — it takes a minute for apps to catch up. We are not too worried about it, overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiIiI9"&gt;Now, would it have gone down easier if Apple had added Face ID to the MacBook Pro? Yes, but at least there’s Touch ID, which is very fast on these machines. Would the notch have gone down easier if the webcam was as good as an iPhone front camera, instead of just, like, pretty good? Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6GA62"&gt;Is it also strange that Apple is leaning into display notches as branding elements on both the MacBook and iPhone, allowing them to be distinctively Apple products without having to put logos anywhere? That seems clearer than ever, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notch on new MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFde5UyfBxFRamE7rmfu9q2Hv5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948752/pesposito_170722_4803_0032.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You stop seeing the notch after a day, just like the iPhone’s notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lqmtO7"&gt;This display is way more interesting than the notch, though. It’s now a Mini LED screen, which means the backlight is composed of ten thousand tiny LEDs, grouped into over 2,500 local dimming zones. That means blacks can get really black on this display — up to a million to one contrast ratio, just like an OLED screen. (When you black out the notch, it’s really black — gone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FC0uX6"&gt;And just as we found with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;Mini LED display on the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, that backlight still has limitations — if you go looking for something called blooming, where there’s a little halo around bright elements on an otherwise black screen, you’ll find it. But you have to go looking for it — in this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYtvehF9-Z8"&gt;YouTube torture test&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the backlight chasing this little square around the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txfHO6"&gt;If you’re watching a movie, you might see a little blooming when the controls come up over black, especially if you’re looking at the display off-axis. We got some questions about whether closed captions would cause blooming when watching a video, and the answer is it’s a non-issue: YouTube captions display over a gray box anyway, and Apple TV and Netflix captions mostly display over the video itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ENLloE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Peak brightness of 1,600 nits is limited to HDR content only; the rest of the screen will peak at 500 nits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xkE17e"&gt;Apple made a big deal about how bright this display can get — it’s an XDR display, just like the Pro Display XDR. And just like the Pro Display XDR, it can reach a peak brightness of 1,600 nits, with a sustained brightness of 1,000 nits. But it’s not quite what you think: the display mostly runs at a max of 500 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbjJTN"&gt;Out of the box, the new MacBook Pros are set to a display profile called Apple XDR Display, which allows it to hit that 1,600-nit peak brightness, but only when viewing HDR content. The rest of the system is the same as every other MacBook Pro and runs at a max of 500 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wA5TuF"&gt;If you have a newer iPhone, you already know what this looks like: you open a photo, and it brightens up. That’s more or less what’s going on with this display: when you have HDR content, it can get a lot brighter and hit that 1,600-nit maximum, but everything else is still SDR, and displays at a maximum of 500 nits. In fact, if you choose the standard Apple Display profile and limit the whole system to 500 nits, you won’t be able to tell the difference until you open an app or play a video that calls for HDR. I asked Apple about this; the company confirmed that the XDR system is content-dependent and designed to run at 500 nits for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3iumm"&gt;The good part is that all of this works really well: HDR video works in every app I tried, including YouTube in Chrome and Safari, and it looks terrifically bright with great colors and saturation. The HDR brightness levels even follow the content around the screen seamlessly, showcasing that Mini LED backlight in action. On a technical level, this display is extremely impressive and way more seamless than any HDR support we’ve seen on the Windows side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHTbzN"&gt;The bad part is that Apple’s marketing is confusing, and functionally this is a 500-nit display that can reach much higher brightness levels with the right content, not a 1,000-nit display, which is what a lot of people are taking away from that spec line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkjqWs"&gt;The upshot of all this is that most Mac users will find this display to be mostly familiar with some meaningful upgrades, but if you’re a Windows person using one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675550/hp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;1,000-nit laptops available in that ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, you shouldn’t expect to sear your eyeballs off with this thing in most situations. We did a quick test working outside and it was fine, but if that specific spec is important to you, you’ll have to go look at one of these in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6x9rwa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ProMotion high refresh rate is only barely perceptible in person&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CZkB35"&gt;The last bit of display nerdery is ProMotion, Apple’s variable refresh rate system that lets the display run at anything from 24 to 120Hz. But I could only just barely see the improvement that 120Hz offers in normal, non-gaming use, and only when really looking. It’s just less obvious when it’s not a touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu3Ydt"&gt;All in all, this display looks great, and a little minor blooming is a fine tradeoff for these black levels. Again, I think this display looks better than Apple’s Pro Display XDR, which has fewer dimming zones, more blooming, and off-axis color and brightness shifts that our team really doesn’t like. This display has none of those issues: it’s bright, accurate even, and generally a pleasure to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zT5Hqe"&gt;Lastly, the speakers on these new MacBook Pros are terrific. The first thing we did with these when we got them was open up a video to check out the new displays, but the first thing we &lt;em&gt;noticed&lt;/em&gt; was that the speakers are so good. They are clear and crisp, with some actual low-end from four woofers, and they get super loud. It’s impressive — and while the 14-inch speakers are really good, the 16-inch models in particular have the best speakers we’ve ever heard on a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ws07o80wpykku6lndDXgqmmuMVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965876/akrales_211027_4820_0151.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thicker and heavier designs for this year’s models are welcome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uYb3Tu"&gt;I’ll just cut to the chase: for content creation and creative work, these are the most powerful laptops we’ve ever tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbp4rW"&gt;The basic M1-family chip design is easy enough to understand, even though it’s a new kind of chip architecture compared to x86, since the fundamental parts are all the same. Apple has three kinds of processor cores — efficiency, performance, and GPU — and all the M1 chips are different combinations of those exact same cores with unified memory between them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRF975"&gt;For example: the 13-inch MacBook Pro we tested last year had a regular M1 with four efficiency cores, four high-performance cores, and eight GPU cores. The M1 Pro and M1 Max change that around a little, with two efficiency cores and up to eight high-performance cores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acqXzi"&gt;The really big difference is in GPUs: the regular M1 has up to an eight-core GPU, while the M1 Pro has up to a 16-core GPU, and the M1 Max is available in 24- and 36-core setups. Again, those GPU cores are the same on all the chips — you just get more of them as you go up the range, along with things like faster memory with higher total limits and additional specialized video encoders. (The M1 Max machines have a little toggle for something called “high power” mode in system settings; Apple told me that simply allows the fan to spin faster for better cooling.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybfdnH"&gt;And… it turns out that adding a bunch of cores and specialized video encoders makes these chips incredibly fast for creative work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18gFET"&gt;The synthetic benchmarks we ran were extremely impressive. The M1 Max got a &lt;em&gt;gigantic &lt;/em&gt;score on PugetBench for Premiere Pro, which tests live playback and export performance at 4K and 8K — beating Nvidia’s RTX 3080 and AMD’s 5900HX. The only computers that even come close are &lt;em&gt;desktops&lt;/em&gt; that use vastly more power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bar graph showing 1,170 result in the PugetBench for Adobe Premiere Pro with the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, 1,072 for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 1,000 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 872 for the Alienware X17 R1, and 538 for the ROG Strix G15 Advantage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V-qZ92lwhSx_fGzXpFviAT2z5jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966211/Bench2___PugetBench_Premiere.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PugetBench for Premiere Pro test results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SqGaWN"&gt;You simply will not find better Adobe Premiere performance from any AMD or Nvidia  laptops on today’s market. This system is generating performance in a tiny laptop chassis that, in the past, we’ve only seen from huge desktop machines with enormous power supplies. And it’s doing that even when it’s &lt;em&gt;unplugged&lt;/em&gt;: when we ran all these benchmarks on battery, we didn’t see a difference in scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB7ncG"&gt;When it comes to Cinebench, as well as Geekbench and other tests that stress the CPU, the M1 Max and the M1 Pro are neck and neck, since they have the same 10-core CPU block. Where the scores start to diverge is on tasks that leverage the GPU, like our export test, PugetBench, Geekbench Compute, and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bar graph showing a 12,368 score in Cinebench R23 multi-core 30-minute loop test for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 12,363 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 12,316 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, 8,500 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro 2019, and 7,729 for the 13-inch MacBook Pro M1." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEh_t4NJk9Q2ftQ3Pnurkt16pXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966216/Bench3___Cinebench_R23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even when running long benchmarks, like this 30-minute Cinebench test, the MacBook Pro’s fans rarely spun up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sZyDpX"&gt;This makes sense, since the M1 Max has the same CPU block as the M1 Pro with more GPU cores and higher memory bandwidth. But it underscores the primary question that should be on your mind if you’re deciding whether to buy the Pro or the Max: how much GPU performance do you need? Things will be the same for an office workload or anything CPU-bound, but the Max has a clear advantage if you have specific GPU-optimized workloads. (You’ll take a battery life hit for those extra GPU cores, though — I’ll come back to that in a bit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zP0j2E"&gt;Of course, synthetic benchmarks only tell part of the story, so to see how well a laptop performs a real-world task, we ran an export of the same five-minute, 33-second 4K video clip in Adobe Premiere Pro. I also gave the machines to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior video director Alix Diaconis to edit and use them for a week to see how they worked for our real video production needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyKmaP"&gt;In that setting, these MacBooks were the fastest laptops we’ve ever seen. The 16-inch with the M1 Max was more than twice as fast as any previous MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bar graph showing a 1 minute 46 second time to export a 5 minute 33 second 4K video from Premiere Pro on the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, 2 minutes 50 seconds for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 2 minutes 51 seconds for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 3 minutes 38 seconds for the Razer Blade 15 Advanced 2021, 5 minutes 28 seconds for the 13-inch MacBook Pro M1, 7 minutes 6 seconds for the Razer Blade 14 2021, and 7 minutes 52 seconds for the 16-inch MacBook Pro 2019." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnLBFYB068GVRlQdKgjyLM4Wl-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966220/Bench1___Premiere_4k_export_test.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro models put up the fastest times in our export test we’ve ever recorded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iMfIAs"&gt;It’s not just the export speeds, either. Here’s what Alix had to say about working with them in Premiere Pro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jV88Kc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Premiere ran smoothly with 4K footage — on both the 14-inch and 16-inch M1 Pro machines, I could play back the timeline at full resolution at 2x speed. But to no surprise, when I added graphics and adjustment layers with color, Premiere started dropping frames. It was minor, but after 20 seconds a frame or two would drop. There was also a short but noticeable lag from hitting the spacebar to the timeline actually playing. It was about one second, as if the computer was thinking before it played. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCYJs0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall, the editing experience was very similar to my regular work machine, a 27-inch iMac from 2019 with an eight-core Intel Core i9, 64GB of RAM, and a Radeon Pro 575x graphics card; the M1 Pro machines were actually choppier during 2x timeline playback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5daH2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the M1 Max with 32 GPU cores, there was no lag between hitting the spacebar and playing, and Premiere ran noticeably smoother than my iMac or the M1 Pro laptops. Scrubbing through the timeline was great — I didn’t notice it drop a frame until 3.5 hours in of editing, which is very impressive. It did slow down with big graphics, though.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3KJBml"&gt;The big caveat about all this performance is that you need software optimized to take advantage of it, and we’re still in the middle of the Apple Silicon transition. For example, Adobe’s software isn’t nearly as optimized as Apple’s. Final Cut Pro is heavily optimized for these chips, and it was &lt;em&gt;over 10 minutes faster&lt;/em&gt; than Premiere Pro exporting a 14-minute 4K clip in ProRes 422.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uytM0s"&gt;Although parts of Adobe’s flagship creative software suite have been partially updated for Apple Silicon — Apple even pre-installed Premiere Pro on our review units — some important apps are not yet updated. This was underlined sharply by an After Effects update that arrived in the middle of our testing, which enabled better multi-core acceleration. After Effects is still an Intel app, which runs in the Rosetta emulation mode on these machines, but the update allowed the app to light up all 10 CPU cores and all 32 GPU cores, cutting export times on our test from 4:29 to… 41 seconds. (It also substantially sped up performance on our Intel-based Mac Pro, which is nice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7h8mvN"&gt;That kind of performance increase is worth real money — it’s the kind of thing that lets our team &lt;em&gt;do more than they could with other machines&lt;/em&gt; because they aren’t spending so much time waiting around for things to export. And as we’ve seen, Adobe’s software isn’t even as heavily optimized as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Liv54d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The performance increase is the kind of thing that lets our team do more than they could before, simply because of how much time is saved&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kf1wTV"&gt;In short: the performance improvements on unoptimized software are notable; on heavily optimized software, they’re incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBbb2A"&gt;There’s another category of apps that haven’t (and may never be) fully optimized to take advantage of Apple’s GPUs: gaming. The M1 Pro and the M1 Max are groundbreaking chips, but they’re also built to do creative work really, really well — they haven’t made the MacBook Pros into serious gaming laptops. We ran the &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; benchmark on the three units we have at its highest settings at 1920 x 1200. The M1 Max averaged 84fps on that benchmark, which is good, but it’s also the exact score we got from the Zephyrus G14 with an RTX 3060 chip, so it’s not beating Nvidia’s top guns. We’ve also seen much better from AMD’s GPUs: the Strix G15 with AMD’s RX 6800M averaged 94fps on this game. You could buy two Zephyrus G14s or two Strix G15s for the price of our M1 Max model and have a lot of money left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6dY8v"&gt;(The two M1 Pro machines did way worse here: they both averaged 46fps on the &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; benchmark, which is way closer to the 2019 Intel MacBook Pro than it is to the M1 Max.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdb8vQ"&gt;So: don’t buy these for gaming. They’re not gaming laptops; most games aren’t optimized for them. Buy something else if you want to play games. But if you want to get a lot of creative work done quickly, there’s nothing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new MagSafe 3 cable plugged in to the new MacBook Pro 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xiSYPHj2vPjMlJSLj8_grXyEjVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965873/akrales_211027_4820_0099.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battery life on the new MacBook Pro 16 with the M1 Pro chip is as impressive as its raw performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="genDxM"&gt;All that performance is excellent, but here’s what’s really impressive: the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro ran for 16 hours on its battery during continuous use, making it the longest-lasting laptop we’ve ever tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KupG42"&gt;To test battery life, we just use the machines during the work day, without plugging in, and without letting the display go to sleep. So that 16 hours involved jumping between a dozen-ish Chrome tabs, using apps like Slack and Spotify, and often running Zoom calls and YouTube videos over that. At one point we were worried we’d fall asleep before the MacBook Pro did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lvFoVy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is a noticeable difference in battery life between models with the M1 Pro and those with the M1 Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Za9COQ"&gt;The other two MacBook Pro models didn’t last quite this long in similar testing — but their results are still exceptional. The 14-inch model with the M1 Pro lasted just over 10 and a half hours during normal use, and the 16-inch M1 Max model ran for just over 10 hours. A lot of you asked about battery life with an external display plugged in; when I worked for a day with the TV I use for Zoom intermittently plugged into the HDMI port on that M1 Max machine, battery life fell to seven hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SQi6R"&gt;These results make sense when you look at what’s inside these devices: the two 16-inch models both have a 100-watt-hour battery, which is the biggest laptop battery you’re allowed to bring on an airplane, while the 14-incher has a smaller 70-watt-hour battery. But the M1 Max has a whole bunch of extra GPU cores to power, and that drains the battery faster. I asked Apple, and the company confirmed the M1 Max uses more power both when idle and when active, but it noted that the M1 Max might potentially be more efficient if you run specific multi-core GPU workloads all day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0yrvb"&gt;A lot of you asked whether the extra money for the M1 Max is worth it, and after all that, we think the answer is: no, not for most people. Carrying around all those extra GPUs has an impact on battery life whether you’re using them or not. Unless you can identify a specific part of your workflow that would benefit from serious multithreaded GPU acceleration, the reality is that you’re probably not going to use them. I recommend really thinking about whether the battery penalty of the M1 Max is worth it for what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back of a space gray MacBook Pro 14 next to the back of a silver MacBook Pro 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RwX_yBFt_XM0QGWyiIzPoHAS5jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965898/akrales_211028_4820_0563.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can still get the MacBook Pro models in either dark gray or silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gKO1yJ"&gt;So: those are the new MacBook Pros. They are some of the best laptops we have ever tested, with an unbeatable combination of lightning fast performance and tremendous battery life. And Apple seems to have come back to reality in terms of design — well, apart from that notch. But adding some useful ports and ditching the Touch Bar are just smart, practical choices, and honestly worth the upgrade for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="enovCL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no denying how expensive these computers are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="46bUyK"&gt;So what are the knocks? The biggest one is that these machines are expensive. If you’re an actual pro, the prices are perhaps easy to justify given the performance, but if you’re just doing everyday productivity work, you can get a lot of great laptops for less than the $2,000 starting price of the 14-inch MacBook Pro. And Apple only putting 16GB of RAM in the base models and charging $400 for an upgrade to 32GB is just ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnFzWT"&gt;The other is that Apple is still in the midst of the transition to its own chips, and the software ecosystem isn’t totally there. These machines feel like the future, but parts of that future are still a little bit hazy. Will Apple’s GPU ideas get fully supported by app developers? We’ve been asking that question for a while, and we still don’t know the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6UaXGa"&gt;But all that said: the new MacBook Pros are excellent. And we’ve all hopefully learned an important lesson about ports and buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="K2IaY8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10834312"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest iPad Pro and Pencil are cheaper than ever today</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MqsAO2SovViJDbjhWjZoAabSUG8=/4x0:1852x1232/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062201/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_12.02.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can pick up the second-gen Apple Pencil today at Verizon for $100 instead of $130.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nVibj5"&gt;The latest 11-inch iPad Pro with an M1 processor is more affordable than ever before today at Amazon. The retail giant is currently selling the Wi-Fi version with 1TB &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0931Z3CWQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $1,299&lt;/a&gt; (the space gray color sadly costs $1,429). As noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we loved the 2021 iPad Pro’s blazing-fast M1 processor, its smaller form factor, and Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks you in the frame while on video calls to keep you centered. It compensates for the fact that Apple still puts its selfie cam at the top of the tablet instead of along its side bezel. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zbbu8i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833256"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VZYmYc"&gt;If you want a capable stylus that’s compatible with the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;, you can find the second-gen Apple Pencil for $100 instead of $130 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Pencil-2nd-Generation%2F949679706" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?sid=VergeDailyDeals102821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-ipad-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, matching its record low price. Unlike the original model, the second-generation version features gesture controls and can wirelessly charge when magnetically attached to the side of your iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMWek1"&gt;Be aware, however, that the new Apple Pencil does not work with the newest entry-level iPad that costs $329. If you want one that is compatible with the iPad, consider picking up the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11365093?sid=VergeDailyDeals10282021Second&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-pencil-for-ipad-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-generation stylus&lt;/a&gt;, which Verizon is currently selling for $80 instead of $100. Note that to charge the original model, you’ll need to plug it into the iPad’s Lightning connector — a design that remains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse"&gt;cringe-worthy&lt;/a&gt; to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1aUma8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gLVQui"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10832871"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="TIasGP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Apple Pencil 2 has gesture controls and charges wirelessly from the iPad Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18023772/new-apple-pencil-2-2018-ipad-stylus-price-release-date"},{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WFPMDk"&gt;Our pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users are selling at an all-time low today on Amazon. Typically $400, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; for just $250, a 37 percent discount. As we wrote in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port for charging, and they fold up in a compact manner. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X3iAJD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OsnZKa"&gt;We’ve got another great deal for non-Apple users, this time on a touchscreen laptop. In her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, my colleague Monica Chin called the latest Surface Laptop 4 “a pretty damn good buy” in comparison to other 15-inch laptops, praising its performance, excellent battery life, and tall 3:2 aspect ratio display that lets you see more on-screen at once. What makes it an even better value is that you can currently purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YX1WLVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;15-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; for its lowest price to date. Typically $2,400, Amazon is selling the matte black-colored model with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of fast PCIe storage, and Intel’s 11th Gen Core i7 processor for $2,250, a cool $150 off the list price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WRAjBo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10832863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgjekP"&gt;If you don’t have room in your home or your budget for a large-screened OLED, a couple of retailers are now selling the 48-inch version of LG’s C1 OLED at a record low. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1176910/2092?subId1=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-48-34-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-hdr-tv-oled48c1%2F-%2FA-82219816"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; are offering the 48-inch LG C1 for $1,097 and $1,100, respectively, down from $1,297. This model has all of the same perks as larger C1 models, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR support, and HDMI 2.1 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wO6emr"&gt;If you do want something bigger, the larger models are still discounted, too, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/10/28/22748849/apple-airpods-pro-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-lg-c1-oled-roku-streaming-stick-deal-sale"&gt;as we wrote about previously&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also offering a six-month subscription to HBO Max when you buy the 55-inch and 65-inch versions of the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch is selling for $1,797&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,500, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is $1,297&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0aERus"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X7wtDQ"&gt;If you’re into gaming, Eneba is currently offering &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states%2Fgamepilot%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year of PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; service for just $37 (the price can fluctuate just a bit) instead of its typical $60 retail price when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;365DAYS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. The popular gaming subscription offers access to a range of perks, including exclusive discounts, access to online multiplayer, and complimentary games every month. PlayStation 5 users will get instant access to the PlayStation Plus Collection, which lets you play &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, and other blockbuster PlayStation 4 titles without paying an additional fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vqT0Dp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NuIuo0"&gt;If you’ve got an Xbox, you might be interested to hear that Eneba’s selling a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global%2Fbest-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDailyDeals10282021&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global%2Fbest-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;for $28 (once again, the price can fluctuate) instead of its usual $45 when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;90DAYS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. Like the aforementioned PlayStation Plus deal, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate gives Xbox owners access to online multiplayer and exclusive deals, as well as many EA Play tiles and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, which is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;widely available on PC, Android, and iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the biggest perk of Game Pass Ultimate is that it lets you access more than 100 Xbox titles for a flat, monthly fee, including &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;finally launches on December 8th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="bP2687"&gt;Apple today posted strong earnings for its &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/"&gt;fourth fiscal 2021 quarter&lt;/a&gt;, reporting all-time highs for its services and Mac divisions. The company says it took in revenue of $83.4 billion, a year-over-year increase of 29 percent, and earnings per share of $1.24. That earnings number came in below Wall Street expectations of $84.85 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbzuCz"&gt;CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/apple-aapl-q4-2021-earnings.html"&gt;told CNBC&lt;/a&gt; that supply chain constraints had a clear impact on financial results this quarter. “We had a very strong performance despite larger than expected supply constraints, which we estimate to be around $6 billion,” Cook said, attributing the supply issues to “the industry-wide chip shortages that have been talked about a lot and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia.” Apple expects an even greater loss from supply chain issues in the December quarter, it said during Thursday’s earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKp8XU"&gt;The company is fresh off the launch of several new products, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad mini&lt;/a&gt;, ninth-gen iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently, the eagerly anticipated MacBook Pro powered by Apple silicon. The latest iPhones weren’t released until late in the quarter, but the iPhone business as a whole continued to show strong momentum and was up 47 percent over a year ago. The iPad was also up 21 percent over the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQpqjy"&gt;Like other large tech companies, and as Cook made clear, Apple is dealing with major supply chain challenges: the high-end iPhones remain difficult to find in stock at Apple retail locations, and its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are already severely backordered. If you don’t want to deal with long shipping delays, the best option is routinely checking stock at local Apple stores. But even that’s not a guaranteed strategy, and the reality is that buying Apple’s latest gadgets is more difficult than in years past.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dropbox clarifies that a native Apple Silicon app is coming in 2022 after forum outrage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5FJSImoVKSscJ0gK7033q8W0Nkk=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70058892/dropbox_logo_2x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Pdh3z"&gt;Dropbox will finally be updating its Mac app to natively support Apple Silicon sometime in the first half of 2022, the company confirmed today. A previous forum thread saw Dropbox staffers claim that a native app would require “a bit more support before we share your suggestion with our team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MAXIF"&gt;The months-old thread was resurfaced in a post by developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1453394500848537605?s=20"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/dropbox-no-plans-to-support-apple-silicon/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), sparking complaints from Dropbox users who were disappointed by the impression that the company would only develop the app if enough customers asked for it. While Dropbox technically does work with Apple Silicon hardware thanks to Apple’s Rosetta 2 software translation layer, it’s not as power or memory efficient as it could be if it ran natively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27WhBd"&gt;In response to the confusion, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/1453762478479843332"&gt;Dropbox’s CEO Drew Houston&lt;/a&gt; clarified that the service is “certainly supporting Apple Silicon” and that it’s been “working for a while on a native M1 build which we aim to release in H1 2022.” Houston also apologized for the support thread responses, which he called “not ideal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1zbF00"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're certainly supporting Apple Silicon, sorry for the confusion. We've been working for a while on a native M1 build which we aim to release in H1 2022. (And agree the responses in the support thread were not ideal)&lt;/p&gt;— Drew Houston (@drewhouston) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/1453762478479843332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bodyDisplay_9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-ideas/Apple-Silicon-M1-Desktop-Sync-Compatibility/idc-p/553669/highlight/true#M64135"&gt;support thread&lt;/a&gt; has also since been resolved with a similar update clarifying the current development of a native M1 app and apologizing for the confusion. “While we regularly ask for customer feedback and input on new products or features, this should not have been one of those instances.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast will bring Apple TV to X1 boxes and the new XClass smart TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Brendan Hunt, Cristo Fernández and Jason Sudeikis in “Ted Lasso”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTfRXVjz4FRNKZs672Qh3EvIWA4=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056848/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020106.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Brendan Hunt, Cristo Fernández and Jason Sudeikis in “Ted Lasso” | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RHCSff"&gt;Comcast’s X1 platform has slowly added apps to its library over the years, and &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/events/event-details/q3-2021-comcast-corporation-earnings-conference-call"&gt;this morning on the company’s earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Brian Roberts announced that the Apple TV app would join the roster soon, while Comcast’s Xfinity Stream app will launch on Apple TV devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zg5NjK"&gt;Comcast’s tech platform, which already has apps for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16593310/netflix-4k-comcast-xfinity-x1-users-stranger-things-house-cards"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17645152/comcast-amazon-prime-video-xfinity-x1-box"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube, and Disney+ in the US, isn’t just on its cable boxes anymore. It underpins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18276040/comcast-flex-streaming-announced-features-pricing"&gt;Xfinity Flex&lt;/a&gt; streaming platform, the XiOne streaming set-top box, and new &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-launches-xclass-tv-powered-by-global-entertainment-platforms"&gt;XClass 4K TVs&lt;/a&gt; that recently launched from Hisense. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="XClass 4K TV" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dK9B-cvClKWfgrY-QnxrxCX-qLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962772/corporate_xclass_tv_inline_yellowstone_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Comcast&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;XClass 4K TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vkkY59"&gt;Two models of the TV are available, in 43- and 50-inch sizes, for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHisense-43-inch-XClass-4K-UHD-A6-Series-Smart-TV-43A6GX%2F357811284&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$298&lt;/a&gt; and $348, respectively. Like other smart TVs in their price range — and other devices on Comcast’s platform — they have streaming apps, Dolby Vision HDR, and voice search remotes. They also include a one-year subscription to Comcast’s Peacock Premium streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vNHK0"&gt;As Comcast tries to sell its tech on devices worldwide (in the UK and other European markets, it’s pushing a &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/introducing-sky-glass-streaming-tv-from-sky"&gt;Sky Glass TV&lt;/a&gt; with the same basic platform), then including access to Apple TV Plus is simply a requirement to compete. Getting its app on Apple TV is a bonus as cord-cutting proceeds to shrink its base of customers with cable TV service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save hundreds on one of the best TVs for gaming today</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can save up to $700 on LG’s brilliant C1 OLED today at multiple retailers.&lt;/em&gt; | LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Chp932"&gt;You can save up to $700 on one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt; today, the LG C1. Right now, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F313720184065%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals102821%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F22748849%2Fapple-airpods-pro-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-lg-c1-oled-roku-streaming-stick-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig’s digital storefront on eBay&lt;/a&gt; is selling the 55-inch model for $1,297 instead of $1,500, while adding $120 of eBay credit and a four-year extended warranty. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%2522-class---c1-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---allstate-3-year-protection-plan-bundle-included-for-5-years-of-total-coverage*.product.100761679.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have the 65-inch versions for $1,800 and $1,797, respectively, though you’ll need to be a Costco member to take advantage of its discount. If you are a Costco member, however, the OLED TV comes with an Allstate Protection Plan —  an extended three-year warranty for your TV — and a $100 streaming credit toward Google Play, Paramount Plus, Showtime, or several other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5d3TKA"&gt;No matter which C1 model you buy, however, all sport several features gamers in particular will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate and Dolby Vision HDR compatibility. All of the configurations also offer support for VRR (variable refresh rate), along with FreeSync and G-Sync adaptive sync technologies, meaning you can enjoy high frame rates without screen tearing. Their HDMI 2.1 support means all of these specs will work well with next-gen consoles, including the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, while the “Game Optimizer” dashboard makes it possible to quickly apply your ideal settings for specific game genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EBsIBl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="OhS6mS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6gdwhB"&gt;It’s only been a week since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;Apple quietly announced them&lt;/a&gt;, yet Amazon is already offering a discount on the latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLWK3AM-A-New-AirPods/dp/B09JQMJHXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro, which come with Apple’s new MagSafe charging case&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $249, you can currently buy the latest version of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best pairs of wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; for $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5amXM"&gt;As the name suggests, the updated charging case for the AirPods Pro is compatible with Apple’s MagSafe charging system. Despite this, it still works with Qi chargers and Lightning cables, and provides for up to 24 hours of playback. The earbuds boast deep integration with iOS and excellent noise cancellation, too, the latter of which silences background noise so you can concentrate more easily on what you’re listening to. They also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;, which can make for a more immersive listening experience. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dTxNYR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10826178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="uO3HIC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Which AirPods model should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"},{"title":"Apple AirPods (third-gen) review: new design, same appeal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sIzbeu"&gt;Android users, we also have a great earbuds deal for you. Right now, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWY75DH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt; at their lowest price to date. Regularly $200, the wireless earbuds are just $141 in the phantom violet style and slightly more in different colorways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDo9su"&gt;As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro had the best sound quality yet of any of the company’s earbuds. Like the AirPods Pro, Samsung’s earbuds also support active noise cancellation and 3D audio, which is essentially Samsung’s version of Apple’s spatial audio feature. However, the Galaxy Buds Pro are rated IPX7 for water and sweat resistance — beating the AirPods Pro’s IPX4. They also allow you to automatically switch between your Galaxy smartphone and tablet, though this feature doesn’t apply to laptops. In addition, their Qi-enabled charging case also allows for 28 hours of playback without noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lfXmFG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="viLELE"&gt;Samsung’s 43-inch M7 Smart Monitor is selling at its lowest price ever on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096MY3BN8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, going for $520 instead of $600. The smart 4K monitor, which is also selling for the same price at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfSvKg0ylwZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, acts as a TV for your PC that you can even mount to your wall or a monitor arm using Vesa mounts. It can stream HDR10 content from a host of popular apps without additional hardware, too, and supports Apple’s AirPlay 2, meaning you can easily cast content from a host of Apple devices. The monitor also comes with a solar-powered remote control and support for Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa, as well as USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V5VbmD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10745870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3KtZxA"&gt;If you have an iPhone 12-series or iPhone 13-series phone, perhaps picking up Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack has come across your mind before. It’s the company’s battery that magnetically snaps onto the back of those phones and begins charging. You can also charge devices like the AirPods Pro with it. Now is officially the best time to buy, since the battery pack is cheaper than ever at Amazon. Regularly $99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MJWY3AM-A-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B099BWY7WT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $80&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jlfMWw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782055"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l6wWl5"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K just launched last month, yet Amazon is already selling the 2021 model at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently offering the streaming device for $35&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s not dramatically different from its predecessor, Roku’s latest streaming stick is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, so you can also use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. And, of course, the stick continues to offer access to popular streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, Vudu, Prime Video, HBO Max, Apple TV Plus, and Sling TV. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="sQKkP1"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212842"&gt;support document&lt;/a&gt; released yesterday details a “&lt;em&gt;Scale to fit below built-in camera”&lt;/em&gt; option in macOS that will forcibly scale apps to only use the display below the notch. It’s a temporary workaround for apps that don’t currently play nice with the notch on Apple’s new MacBook Pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FC8ZmZ"&gt;The camera notch cutout on Apple’s latest laptops was meant to enable a more expansive edge-to-edge screen. But as we saw yesterday, owners of the new MacBook Pro models have seen both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"&gt;apps and the OS misbehave&lt;/a&gt;, whereby app menus and status bar items can get hidden under the camera cutout. The scale-to-fit workaround fixes this, but results in the type of large bezels the notch was meant to negate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98Uor4"&gt;The scaling feature was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jatodaro/status/1453382287328874497"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; by artist @Jatodaro on Twitter, showing how checking the box for &lt;em&gt;‘Scale to fit below built-in camera’&lt;/em&gt; in an app’s &lt;em&gt;Get Info&lt;/em&gt; window will shrink the display for all apps. The full-sized display (with notch) will only return if either the app is closed or if the box is unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuSL5X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good news for notch haters! If you've got an app (or apps) with menus that collide with the notch, just Get Info on the app, and enable "Scale to fit below built-in camera". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the app is running (even in the bg), your display is scaled.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/M1Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#M1Pro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/M1Max?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#M1Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MacBookPro2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MacBookPro2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nlGqkFkXAH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nlGqkFkXAH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Joseph from Sketch (@Jatodaro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jatodaro/status/1453382287328874497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Qhs5"&gt;Apple also mentions in the support document that this scaling feature will disappear once developers update their apps to deal with the notch correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use SharePlay to share your FaceTime screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVae-cS6Azvyc1ojvyhJoeTGAOg=/151x0:1708x1038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70054096/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_3.39.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1rVwYI"&gt;One of the new features that iOS 15 has promised to offer is the ability to share your iPhone and iPad screen during FaceTime sessions so that you can enjoy films, music, and other media along with friends and family. While this new feature, called SharePlay, did not ship with the first version of iOS 15, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;it has been included in iOS 15.1&lt;/a&gt; and can now be enjoyed — to a limited extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoTigL"&gt;Currently, you can share content from Apple TV and Apple Music — assuming both of you are subscribers — and a few other apps. I had no problem sharing a YouTube video, for example; other apps that are supported include HBO Max, Hulu, and Disney Plus (but not Netflix). It can be presumed that the list of shareable apps will continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B82Gs8"&gt;It’s quite easy to use the new SharePlay feature, once you’ve installed iOS 15.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6YTBHh"&gt;Start a FaceTime session. Make sure whoever else is on the session also has iOS 15.1 installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gnLi6x"&gt;You should see a new icon on the upper right side of the screen that resembles a small figure in front of a screen. Tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ApbjOw"&gt;You’ll see a drop-down button that says “Share My Screen.” Tap on that and you’ll be sharing your screen with your friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on “Share My Screen” to start using SharePlay." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uVCThijIWn6KU7YrpNwga9zSr58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960467/IMG_DD5C33FA0874_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on “Share My Screen” to start using SharePlay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SharePlay lets you both watch the same YouTube video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Njh9Kxf8AiYyMVmvf0mlfAzZptA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960468/IMG_60BC16B3DB0E_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay lets you both watch the same YouTube video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gOH64r"&gt;Now you can show off your homescreen to your FaceTime friend, play a YouTube video, or listen to the same Apple Music track. If you want to switch to the other person’s screen, all they have to do is tap on their SharePlay icon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkI9Sr"&gt;Another way to share an app is to simply go to that app during a FaceTime session and start it up. If SharePlay is possible, you will get a pop-up menu asking if you want to use SharePlay, or if you want to play the video or music only for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ox15m"&gt;And at any time, you can go back to your FaceTime app, tap on the SharePlay icon, and select End SharePlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can see your friend’s home screen in miniature, or tap on it to maximize it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIJXzKVleBy8TbXilrjRe4y9D28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960470/IMG_B56CC427212E_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see your friend’s homescreen in miniature, or tap on it to maximize it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Unfortunately, some apps are not yet supported." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YmKZe1FqMkh6pCpIlWooRMI5wDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960475/IMG_B3896698408C_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, some apps are not yet supported.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHryBS"&gt;The new SharePlay feature in iOS 15.1 is probably going to be very popular. It will allow friends and family to chat together while watching videos or listening to music; let business associates discuss a spreadsheet while out and about; or make it easier to share and comment on your latest group photos. And as Apple adds more apps that can make use of SharePlay, it should just get better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s system to tell on creepy apps just arrived in beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTD-U2p-SrpiBi62HoKVK65tcPk=/223x0:2416x1462/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70054031/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.46.16.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1L2lT"&gt;Apple’s App Privacy Report, announced at WWDC 2021, has &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=n5jlz7ox&amp;amp;1635379062"&gt;made its way onto iPhones&lt;/a&gt; with the first release of the iOS 15.2 beta, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/everything-new-ios-15-2/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The new screen in Settings gives users an overview of what information their apps have access to and what they’re sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HY1At2"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0TD96VTf0Xs?t=3053"&gt;Apple’s WWDC announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the feature will show you what permissions apps have and how often they accessed them over the past week (for example, it could show that your weather app accesses your location every hour). The report will also show you which other web domains the app contacted and let you compare that with the sites you visited directly in the app to give you a better idea of who could be seeing your data. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajuZM4lbuJsxSChLwSIK-RBGslA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960619/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.32.28.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Safari Privacy Report, which shows similar data but for the websites you visit instead of the apps you use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NXYzhT"&gt;Some of Apple’s other privacy initiatives haven’t sat well with all developers. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296309/google-gmail-ios-app-privacy-labels"&gt;took Google almost two months&lt;/a&gt; to adopt iOS App Store privacy labels, and both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738940/snap-q3-2021-earnings-ios-ad-tracking"&gt;Snap&lt;/a&gt; partially blamed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;iPhone’s Ad Tracking Transparency feature&lt;/a&gt; (which lets users easily opt out of certain forms of ad tracking) for missed revenue goals. It’s possible that we’ll see more complaints from developers if the App Privacy Report paints them in a negative light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYgl6K"&gt;As always with betas, it’s not a sure-fire thing that this feature will make it into the final 15.2 release. However, Apple’s SharePlay feature, which showed up in the 15.1 beta (after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;taken out from an earlier beta&lt;/a&gt; release), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;did end up shipping with the final version&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s a good chance we could see the privacy report soon. Whether we like what shows may be another story entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5JoGh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS8GMH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese students sue Apple for not including a charger with the iPhone 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OHfvlwkzpoAbgcEOjTGzpSEO4Pk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052302/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="poI4Sh"&gt;Five Chinese students are suing Apple for not providing a charger with the iPhone 12, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vqmb/apple-sued-china-iphone-chargers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;stopped including EarPods and wall chargers with iPhones&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, opting only to include a USB-C to Lightning cable in its packaging. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/"&gt;According to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, ditching the charger and EarPods is supposed to reduce carbon emissions and preserve raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qf2nzM"&gt;There’s some skepticism as to whether Apple really did this to cut costs, rather than save the environment, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;the transition to 5G could make iPhones more expensive to make&lt;/a&gt;. Skipping out on chargers and EarPods could be a way for Apple to save a buck, and forcing customers to purchase accessories separately may help increase profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXtIhD"&gt;The students’ argument in court, which is a part of the Xiaocheng Cup Public Welfare Litigation Competition, cruxes on this premise. A report by the &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/z4w89z7vhGdeTY2algqlYw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shanghai Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes the case in detail, noting that one of the students, named Xiaofang, was frustrated that her purchase of the iPhone 12 Pro Max didn’t come with a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66GsW9"&gt;Xiaofang points out that since the cable included with the device is a USB-C to Lightning, it’s not compatible with the wall chargers that were previously included with Apple devices (via &lt;em&gt;Shanghai Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;). This means that customers will have to purchase a USB-C-compatible charger or a MagSafe charger if they don’t have one already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxHSQY"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;, Xiaofang claims that Apple is leaving out wall chargers to promote its MagSafe chargers, a line of magnetic chargers that powers your phone wirelessly. She alleges that Apple’s decision not to include a charger is motivated by profit, and that Apple is merely operating under the guise of saving the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6aYMwb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A year later, Apple’s MagSafe continues to underwhelm ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728967/apple-magsafe-duo-wallet-cases-charging"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="j5Bc3i"&gt;Xiaofang and her colleagues took Apple to the Beijing Internet Court, asking for Apple to provide a wall charger, as well as pay 100 yuan ($16) for breach of contract and for litigation fees (via &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;). As mentioned in the report by the &lt;em&gt;Shanghai Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;, a representative for Apple argued that it’s common for companies to sell phones without a charger and noted that the iPhone 12’s packaging makes it clear that no charger is included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFFHw1"&gt;The case is reportedly still in progress and has since gone viral on Chinese social media site Weibo, where the students have seen an outpouring of support (via &lt;a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202110/1237420.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Suing Apple for such a small sum may seem odd, but it’s the statement that matters. According to the report by &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt;, a Chinese student sued the Shanghai Disney Resort in 2019 for just 50 yuan ($7) for not letting customers bring food into the park — Disney later conceded and agreed to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uc0fCf"&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple has faced legal issues for not providing chargers. Earlier this year, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22342051/brazil-regulator-fines-apple-2-million-chargers-iphone-12"&gt;Brazilian regulator fined Apple $2 million&lt;/a&gt; for failing to include chargers with the iPhone 12, alleging that Apple is misleading the customer by selling it without one.&lt;/p&gt;
