    <title>Stadia comes to the iPhone and iPad with new iOS beta</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IHlTLd"&gt;Google Stadia has finally made its way to iOS over a year after launch. The company’s mobile web beta for the iPhone and iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;first announced last month&lt;/a&gt;, is launching today. That means any Stadia user on either its free tier or its paid Stadia Pro subscription will be able to access their library of Stadia games on Apple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsmvd1"&gt;Google, like other competing cloud services, is using mobile Safari due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming apps&lt;/a&gt; that mean platforms like Stadia can’t exist in their current form on the App Store. You can access Stadia through its website on Safari or by creating a home screen icon that will turn the service into a progressive web app, so it acts almost identically to a native one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qcI7H"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now&lt;/a&gt; or the planned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;mobile web version of Microsoft’s xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, however, Google Stadia has a free tier without restrictions and now offers two free-to-play games available (&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R&lt;/em&gt;), with more to come. That means anyone with a Gmail account looking to try Stadia can give it a shot on an iPhone or iPad with minimal effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J29xgg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google Stadia now works on both Android and iOS, thanks to its new mobile web app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jCnxaH"&gt;That accessibility could be key for Stadia’s growth going forward. Much of the early struggles of Stadia, and the many failed or otherwise unknown cloud platforms that have come before it, have to do with a mix of technical issues and economic hurdles, roadblocks that mean actually using the service as your primary gaming platform is more cumbersome and costly than the benefits. But Stadia is in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;much different place now than it was at launch&lt;/a&gt;. The service not only has a free tier and free-to-play games, but it also has access to high-profile holiday releases like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla &lt;/em&gt;and the just-released &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4UQFQ"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s new open-world sci-fi game has been plagued by bugs and performance issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;mainly affecting players on last-gen game consoles&lt;/a&gt;, which is a boon for the Stadia version. Google had to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/13/stadia-cyberpunk-premiere-edition-ended/"&gt;shut down a promotion for the game&lt;/a&gt; that awarded free Stadia controllers and Chromecast Ultra devices to anyone who preordered or purchased &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on Stadia up to a week after its release due to overwhelming demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oTHDB"&gt;Adding iOS support may add to the momentum Stadia is experiencing right now. I’ve had access to the beta on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Stadia test account for the last week or so where I’ve been testing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and other games on my iPad Pro and iPhone 11 Pro. It works remarkably well, even with the built-in touch controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6rRdN"&gt;I wouldn’t recommend relying on those touch controls for anything that requires precise input, but it was nice to know I could still maneuver the &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; interface using my iPhone touchscreen to perform simple tasks, like carousing the in-game Tower hub to pick up bounties or check my character’s inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIQB4B"&gt;Instead of touch, you’re better off using either a Stadia controller or one of the supported Bluetooth gamepads like Microsoft’s Xbox One controller or the Sony DualShock 4, and those controllers work seamlessly via mobile Safari with no issues I’ve encountered so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4KV7KW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ promotion ended early due to overwhelming demand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahaUq"&gt;I will say that you have to rely on a Wi-Fi connection to reliable play on iOS unless you happen to be the owner of a rather rare and situational Ethernet to Lightning or USB adapter accessory. That means you’re not going to get super smooth visuals or performance all of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3JZf7"&gt;Still, a lot of the visual hiccups you might experience from using Stadia on an average Wi-Fi connection on a larger screen are not as noticeable when playing on the iPhone or iPad. In particular, I’ve found playing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on my iPad Pro to be a pretty consistent and solid experience, more so in some cases than on my PlayStation 5 where I find the game often crashes numerous times during a single play session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhm6ka"&gt;Due to Apple’s restrictions, Google says you will need to perform a tiny workaround to get the Stadia web version on your iOS device’s home screen as a progressive web app, and it’s created this graphic to explain it:  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWtie2jMLEozrXhvuepl2VwNu2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174622/Stadia_iOS_setup.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EYTrB3"&gt;The big caveat right now is that there are not a whole lot of great games on Stadia that cater to mobile players. I don’t see anyone going out of their way to boot up the new &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on an iPhone screen, except to marvel at the novelty of it. I think the iPad is primarily where Stadia on iOS will shine for the players who have a nice enough screen, a fast enough connection, and a controller to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03WshK"&gt;But iOS support opens up a lot of avenues for Stadia — not just to bring it more players looking for a more robust mobile gaming solution but also to promote cloud gaming to developers making the kinds of games fit for mobile screens. If Google cozies up to more indie developers and starts supporting more of the less graphical-intensive experiences you might see on, say, a Nintendo Switch, that could make Stadia a much more competitive platform. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Chromecast is getting an Apple TV app soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3czhhyJW1Bp6nd5tJHlB-DYrUHg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522750/DSCF2108.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="IeEpFU"&gt;Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;latest Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt; is filling in one of its biggest missing apps, with the company announcing that it’ll &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/apple-tv/"&gt;soon be offering an Apple TV app&lt;/a&gt; in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaG0na"&gt;The Apple TV app will function similarly to other versions of Apple’s service on other devices, allowing subscribers to watch Apple TV Plus original shows, movies, and documentaries (including &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;and other shows that are not &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which are therefore less good). Those Apple TV originals will be integrated into Google TV’s content aggregation system, too, allowing the software to recommend them based on your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHUFpW"&gt;Additionally, the Apple TV app will give Chromecast users access to their purchased iTunes library of TV shows and movies, as well as any Apple TV channels to which they’re already subscribed. The news marks the second major addition of Apple services to Google products, following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22157873/google-apple-music-assistant-nest-smart-speakers-displays"&gt;recently added support&lt;/a&gt; for Apple Music on Google Assistant smart speakers earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lipcwC"&gt;Google hasn’t given an exact release date for the Apple TV app, but it promises that the app should launch in early 2021 — first on the Chromecast with Google TV, then followed by other Android TV OS-powered devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save up to $50 on Apple’s new Mac mini with M1 at B&amp;H Photo today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJz18PtYp96dYMfepUXYW-UwDGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522344/cwelch_201114_4292_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZ8W3Z"&gt;Apple had a solid year of tech products across a wide variety of categories. From introducing the M1 chip on computers (including the MacBook Pro), releasing four new iPhones (including the first iPhone with the “mini” moniker), two new Apple Watches, and a few updates on some iPad models, this year’s releases spanned a wide gamut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfjv0F"&gt;Today’s deals highlight some of the better discounts you can find right now if you want to buy some Apple tech this holiday season, including historically low prices on the Mac mini with M1 and multiple iPad Pro configurations discounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eJ1uGJ"&gt;The new Mac mini with M1 is on sale at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WdjsGd"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;new Mac mini with the M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; launched last month, and if you were looking to upgrade to this computer, you could get the base configuration with &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB of memory and 256GB of SSD for only $669&lt;/a&gt; at B&amp;amp;H Photo. If you need a bit more storage, the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage (and 8GB of RAM) model is $849&lt;/a&gt;, which is $50 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="kDK6r3"&gt;Save up to $100 on select iPad Pro configurations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q7Xbyx"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro models feature a dual-lens rear camera, 4K rendering for video editing apps, a 120Hz display, and Face ID.

&lt;p id="UszOBy"&gt;The holiday season is a great time to buy an influx of video games, given how many holiday sales are available at various retailers.

    <title>Apple AirPods Max review: luxurious sound for a luxury price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s over-ear headphones have tremendous build quality and sound, but there’s no denying they’re expensive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1P4ReR"&gt;After a long lead-up of rumors, Apple managed to squeeze in the AirPods Max just under the wire as its last big hardware release of 2020. It wasn’t surprising to see the company launch its own over-ear, noise-canceling headphones after the meteoric rise and popularity of AirPods, which have come to define the category of true wireless earbuds; nobody really managed to crack it before Apple. The AirPods Max are entering a very different space, where many other companies have excellent options available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uH1aHX"&gt;There have been a lot of initial reactions to the AirPods Max, but the one that’s dominated them all is sticker shock: the $549 price is hundreds more than what established competitors like Bose and Sony are charging for their quite excellent noise-canceling headphones. And that’s the crux of the challenge Apple faces: unlike with AirPods, it’s late to this game, and there’s a lot to prove if consumers are going to be sold on spending so much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uWfHLG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10230050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1vL4m3"&gt;The price tag of the AirPods Max sits far above mainstream noise-canceling headphones, but there are many headphones that go for the same amount and beyond — wireless ones, too. I don’t think it makes sense to compare these against thousand-dollar (and wired) open-back headphones you’d plug into a DAC for listening sessions with a hi-fi music collection; fundamentally, these are Bluetooth headphones aimed at a large consumer audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r34qU7"&gt;Even so, Apple has tried to match that upper echelon of boutique headphones in terms of build quality and craftsmanship: the AirPods Max have a design heavy on aluminum, steel, and fabric that’s the polar opposite of something like Sony’s plastic-everywhere WH-1000XM4 headphones. There’s nothing &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with plastic; those Sony cans have taken a beating in my bag and still work great. But everything about the AirPods Max exudes precision — even their unibody metal ear cups, bland as they might seem. (The widely ridiculed carrying “case” is antithetical to this whole notion, but I’ll get to that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwAWH5"&gt;This isn’t a review where I’m going to say that the AirPods Max are the best headphones for most people. They are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. If all you want is a good, reliable set of noise-canceling headphones for commuting, travel, or working from home, save your money and stick with something like the Sony 1000XM4s, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, or the Microsoft Surface Headphones 2, all of which cost at least $200 less. You’ll be well served by any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWi6F_7pX1BvXr2Cs7-tQQUnOJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173981/DSCF2705_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JWPBfk"&gt;That said, the AirPods Max &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; make sense for certain people who can immediately find a reason they’re “worth it.” The comfort and feel are top notch, they sound wonderful, the noise cancellation is up there with the very best, and they offer unique features like spatial audio that you really can’t get elsewhere. At least, not quite like this. So it’s worth breaking down some reasons why the AirPods Max could be worth buying if you’ve got the disposable cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR83bg"&gt;Fit and finish top the list of pros. The AirPods Max have a stainless steel headband that’s wrapped in a soft polyurethane material. A knit mesh canopy does a good job of keeping the substantial weight of these headphones from putting irritating pressure on the top of your head. The rotating, pivoting aluminum ear cups are attached by telescoping steel stems that take some effort to extend but always stay in place at whatever length you leave them. (The headphones can’t fold up for more efficient storage, unfortunately.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ri-m_ZrRCZfn0dGhgLIZUzR-t9U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173665/DSCF2665.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s craftsmanship is on full display with the AirPods Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Silr6"&gt;The ear cushions are made from acoustic memory foam with a breathable mesh layer on top. Hopefully, that’ll make for less sweaty ears in warmer months. They attach magnetically, are easy to take off, and popping them back into place is immensely satisfying. The ear cushions are large and oval-shaped, so they won’t uncomfortably press against your ears like some circular ear pads can. Replacement sets (and other colors) are available for $69 a pair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMyQZN"&gt;I’d recommend steering clear of the silver or other lighter colors; the white ear cushions on my review unit are already starting to look a bit dirty after just a few days of wearing them. Going for space gray or the blue color would be my recommendation. The trade-off of Apple’s high-style design is that these materials won’t stay pristine; the company &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208729"&gt;provides basic cleaning instructions&lt;/a&gt;, and the ear cushions are easy enough to pop off and wipe down, but I’m not sure what you’re supposed to do if, say, the headband fabric gets mucked up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPKgoo8smrsie4vx_q7jiXawtV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173682/DSCF2676.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cushions are super comfortable and should accommodate ears of any size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s6qmek"&gt;Look around the AirPods Max and you’ll find just two buttons: there’s the Digital Crown — a much larger version than the dial on the Apple Watch — and a button that switches between noise canceling and transparency modes. I’ve really come to like the crown for controlling volume and playback; you don’t get the false inputs or missed swipes that can happen with touch gestures. It’s also easier to use with gloves in cold weather. You press it once to play / pause, twice to skip tracks, or three times to go back; holding it down will activate Siri. Sometimes my fingers will hit the steel stem when feeling for it since they’re close together, but that’s a minor gripe that muscle memory should overcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8liBs"&gt;You’ll notice I said nothing about a power button, and that’s because the AirPods Max lack one. They power on when placed on your head, and automatically pause music if removed (or if you lift one ear cup). Take them off fully, and they’ll go into a sleep mode when left on a table or around your neck for a few minutes. When slid into their case, the headphones enter a deeper ultra-low-power mode. I’ve left the AirPods Max out overnight several times without the case and they’ve barely lost any of their charge, so you don’t need to worry about battery drain. This design quirk has been deemed “very Apple” by some, but I wish they’d just stuck a power button somewhere for simplicity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBpsVm"&gt;There are a lot of cutouts for microphones and sensors around the AirPods Max — there are nine microphones in all, with eight of them used for noise cancellation — and behind those ear cushions are powerful, custom-designed 40-millimeter drivers. Apple says the “dual-neodymium ring magnet motor” backing each driver is inspired by floor-standing speakers and is the reason you won’t hear any distortion even when the Max headphones are cranked to peak volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YuNGcz8IBVQajdFqVk6GHwUE70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173866/DSCF2681_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max feature 40mm drivers designed by Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hoZsPT"&gt;On that note, the second pro for the AirPods Max is sound quality. These headphones make for delightful listening. Apple has struck a great balance between the highs, mids, and lows, and there’s a broader soundstage with these than you’d get from the Sony or the Bose cans. The bass isn’t going to rattle your skull, but in my tests, I’ve consistently found there’s always enough to make songs shine as they’re supposed to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6gi0u"&gt;Apple uses “computational audio” with the H1 chips in each ear cup and the aforementioned mics to constantly measure what you’re hearing from the headphones, and it adjusts EQ to account for how the headphones fit your head and seal against your ears. The company says it aims for a faithful reproduction of your music, but don’t mistake these for flat or neutral studio headphones. If I had to pick two words to describe them, I’d say tight and refined. You get ample bass, and higher frequencies never sound harsh or fatiguing. Complex, multi-layered arrangements from Bon Iver or Phoebe Bridgers are immersive and uncluttered. Acoustic guitars come through with satisfying warmth and clarity. The low end is never muddy — regardless of genre — and the AirPods Max do a great job of showcasing every element of a well-produced track. With these headphones, you get the best of everything Apple has learned about audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RLGDV"&gt;But a lot of people want to know whether the AirPods Max sound &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt; to justify their high price. And there’s no easy answer. If you’re nitpicky about audio quality, you’ll notice how great these sound. But the Sony 1000XM4s are popular for a reason, and one of them is booming bass, a criteria where they can still handily beat out the AirPods Max. Other noise-canceling headphones like the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless also give Apple a run for its money on sound quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VMYlJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10230439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3qHDGB"&gt;When it comes to active noise cancellation, Apple is neck and neck with the very best. The AirPods Max do an equally good job as Sony and Bose at quieting the outside world. They might even be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s all very close. They aced my tests at the coffee shop, on the subway, and walking through Manhattan. When you do need to hear what’s happening, transparency mode sounds just as natural here — almost like you’re not wearing headphones at all — as with the AirPods Pro. Apple leads the pack on this feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG6JDi"&gt;Another reason to consider the AirPods Max is spatial audio. Like the AirPods Pro, these can give you an immersive experience that mimics surround sound on an iPhone or iPad when you’re watching videos with supported apps like Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, and HBO Max. (Audio from shows and movies with a 5.1 or 7.1 mix can be converted into spatial audio.) We’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18093348/dolby-dimension-headphone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Dolby&lt;/a&gt; and other companies pursue immersive surround sound headphones before, but Apple’s approach feels a bit more visceral and captivating and should only get better with time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUTgXf"&gt;Since iPhones and iPads have positional awareness from their built-in sensors, they can send that data to the headphones to keep the sound in front of you at all times; even if you turn your head side to side, the sound field stays planted wherever the device is. Spatial audio doesn’t quite stack up to an actual 7.1 Atmos system. How could it? But it’s a captivating experience that will come in handy once everyone starts traveling again. You’ll absolutely notice the downgrade if you switch back to regular stereo audio for a superhero flick. I really wish spatial audio worked with the Apple TV, so you could experience great sound in the living room — and from a big screen — even if you don’t have a soundbar or surround setup. This would also let you get absorbed in an action blockbuster with a partner sleeping beside you at night. But for now, the Apple TV can’t do spatial audio since it lacks the positional sensors in Apple’s mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOQQZE"&gt;The last big win for the AirPods Max is that they’re just… &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. Like regular AirPods, they pair to your phone simply by holding the two close together. And with the latest iOS and macOS software updates, they can now automatically switch between an iPhone, iPad, and Mac depending on what device you’re using at that moment — without you having to do anything. If I’m paying $550 for headphones, I damn sure want that level of convenience. That said, the Sony, Bose, and many other headphones let you pair with two devices at the same time, so that might be enough flexibility for you, especially if not every device you use has an Apple logo on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlwA5jb2W7XX8QvLNIoZ_s3hTXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173667/DSCF2672.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This AirPods Max “case” offers little in the way of everyday protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CYVwwk"&gt;But now we come to the cons, and far and away the worst thing about the AirPods Max is their case. If you can call it that, which I consider generous. Look, putting aside all the memes about it looking like a handbag or bra, it’s a failure on every level at functionality, and I don’t know what Apple was thinking. It makes the AirPods Max easy to recognize at a distance — maybe that was the main goal — but in terms of doing &lt;strong&gt;case&lt;/strong&gt; things, it’s a joke that offers virtually no protection for your $550 headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtHwPE"&gt;I wouldn’t feel good about throwing this into a packed bag; the ear cups could get scratched since there are so many slits in the case, and something could poke through that exposed mesh canopy. The case also picks up dirt and smudges in no time. This is a bad enough misfire that it drags down the entire product. Everyone else gets this right, and it’s baffling that Apple could get it so wrong. I’d expect to see many third-party cases for the AirPods Max very soon, and I predict Apple will sell some of those directly — because this thing is just untenable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-9dGrfhl27Chu-2MvPE2piYSpk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173805/DSCF2666_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max lack a 3.5mm jack and only have a Lightning port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q4OVWW"&gt;Another downside? No 3.5mm jack. The AirPods Max only have a Lightning connector, so if you want higher-quality wired audio or to plug them in on a plane, you’ve got to get a $35 cable. (No, putting an aux cord between two iPhone headphone dongles won’t work.) Ouch. I can live without the 3.5mm jack, but to not include the cable in the box? At this price?! Rude. Also, it’s worth mentioning that there’s no passive mode for the AirPods Max. When they’re out of juice, they stop working altogether — even if you’re wired. You can’t use the very good, clear-sounding voice mics on the headphones when plugged in, either. But the cable is good for eliminating all latency if you want to use the AirPods Max for recording or monitoring purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nBfHF"&gt;Battery life is rated at 20 hours with all the features like noise cancellation turned on, which is good and more than adequate for lengthy flights, but still 10 or so hours less than Sony’s total running time. On a drained battery, charging for five minutes will get you around 90 minutes of playing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFKIvA"&gt;Now let me double back to just how much the AirPods Max weigh. The open mesh canopy does a good job of distributing their heft (even on my enormous head), and the ear cushions reduce any feeling of being weighed down. But at 385 grams, there’s no denying these are a good deal heavier than cans from Bose or Sony (254 grams). They’re not uncomfortable for me — even after a couple hours of nonstop listening — but I’m always very aware that they’re on. And it’s something to be mindful of if you’ve had any neck problems. These are definitely leisure headphones meant for the couch or sitting at your desk — and, eventually, they’ll be great travel headphones — but gym or running headphones they are not. The AirPods Max aren’t water resistant at all, but that’s true of most premium noise-canceling headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAkWfP"&gt;The last reason to hold off on the AirPods Max right now is what I consider unrealized potential. Most people are going to be streaming Apple Music or Spotify through these things. And that means (in the case of Apple Music) you’re limited to the same compressed 256kbps AAC files we’ve been listening to for years. Apple still doesn’t offer a lossless tier, and I have to ask, if not now, when? I can plug into my iPhone with the cable and get higher quality music from Amazon Music HD or Tidal than I can from Apple itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxgXqw"&gt;On the Android side, Sony’s headphones have LDAC, a wireless codec that can wirelessly stream music at near-CD quality. Apple is falling behind here, but there’s no indication that the company cares. You can make all the arguments you want about how it doesn’t matter or that people can’t hear any difference, but when we’re talking about $550 headphones — not to mention the powerful HomePod speaker — an option to enjoy higher-quality audio should at least be there. Apple moved to 256kbps AAC &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2007%2F05%2F30Apple-Launches-iTunes-Plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22177494%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all the way back in 2007&lt;/a&gt; and we’ve been stuck there ever since. (“Mastered for iTunes” albums can offer improved dynamic range and subtle enhancements, but it’s no replacement for going lossless.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jg5OSk"&gt;Shipping estimates for the AirPods Max are already extending into March, but I hesitate to read too much into that. These headphones might end up a hit like the earbuds they share a name with, but they could also just coast by in the same vein as something like the HomePod, another Apple product that was priced higher than the competition when released (and hurt by it). If you’re the kind of person that knows you’ll love the AirPods Max, you shouldn’t hesitate to go for it. They sound killer for music and movies alike. And they &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they should cost even more money. They’re about as luxurious as noise-canceling headphones get — but not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409031/bang-olufsen-beoplay-h95-noise-canceling-headphones-announced"&gt;as expensive as they come&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cv2URg"&gt;But there’s still no world where I recommend the AirPods Max to your average headphone shopper, especially when the AirPods Pro offer a lot of the same features for less. Many consumers will be perfectly happy sticking with the tried-and-true options from Sony, Bose, Microsoft, and elsewhere. At the very least, it’s probably worth waiting for Apple Music HD or spatial audio on the Apple TV or, for god’s sake, a better case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook criticizes Apple’s iOS privacy changes with full-page newspaper ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZ8nzEUiHDRKZmMRbXSOmwDkXi8=/0x0:1980x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68521115/facebooknewspaperad.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s newspaper ad.&lt;/em&gt; | Dave Stangis (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/DaveStangis/status/1339183289349918721" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtzT51"&gt;Facebook is publicly criticizing Apple’s upcoming iOS privacy changes in full-page newspaper ads today. “We’re standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere,” reads the headline on an ad inside the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; today. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/facebook-attacks-apple-s-ios-changes-in-full-page-newspaper-ads"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the ads are related to Apple’s iOS 14 privacy changes that will make it more difficult for companies like Facebook to target users with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FF9Wb"&gt;Developers will need to ask iOS 14 users for permission to gather data and track them across mobile apps and websites on an iPhone and iPad soon. Apple had planned to implement these changes with the initial iOS 14 release in September, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed enforcing them until early next year&lt;/a&gt;. These changes will impact Facebook’s ad business, and in particular its ad network for developers and businesses, as end users are more likely to opt out of tracking prompts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDIFYM"&gt;Facebook claims Apple’s changes will be “devastating to small businesses” that rely on its ad network to generate sales. The newspaper ads direct small businesses to Facebook’s “&lt;a href="http://fb.com/speakupforsmall"&gt;speak up for small business&lt;/a&gt;” site, where a series of business owners speak out about Apple’s changes. “Small businesses deserve to be heard,” Facebook writes. “We hear your concerns, and we stand with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5hXbSk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m pretty certain &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Facebook?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is fighting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; to retain access to personal data. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PID?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/privacy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#privacy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fullpagead?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fullpagead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wsj?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#wsj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/029WwaGSs0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/029WwaGSs0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dave Stangis (@DaveStangis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveStangis/status/1339183289349918721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdqX3z"&gt;While Apple hasn’t responded directly to today’s newspaper ads, the company did respond to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-19/apple-defends-decision-to-delay-privacy-feature-slams-facebook"&gt;similar Facebook claims&lt;/a&gt; last month. The iPhone maker accused Facebook of a “disregard for user privacy.” Apple is adamant that its iOS 14 privacy policies will be enforced in early 2021, and has &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=hx9s63c5&amp;amp;1599152522"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; it’s “committed to ensuring users can choose whether or not they allow an app to track them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ud375"&gt;Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;new App Store Privacy labels&lt;/a&gt; this week, shining a light on how iOS apps use your data. Notably, the privacy label on Facebook’s iOS app expands across several pages, listing all the data that can be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YkmB4S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple exposing all the ways Facebook tracks you with it iOS app is really quite something &lt;a href="https://t.co/hDhB85qk1L"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hDhB85qk1L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1339174301564604418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dyHAKR"&gt;These full-page newspaper ads are the latest in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;public spat between Facebook and Apple&lt;/a&gt; over privacy, policies, and more. Facebook slammed Apple’s App Store policies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, after it had to remove a mini games feature to pass Apple’s strict App Store approval process. Facebook also welcomed the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) this week. Both acts introduce new rules for digital platform holders, and aim to force companies to rapidly remove illegal content from the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKEjNj"&gt;“We hope the DMA will also set boundaries for Apple,” said a Facebook spokesperson in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/facebook-criticizes-apple-as-it-welcomes-europes-new-tech-rules.html"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple controls an entire ecosystem from device to app store and apps, and uses this power to harm developers and consumers, as well as large platforms like Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Siri can now play animal sounds and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_IPFpP_OAf3SYAARwGpaSOoYYFY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518259/acastro_180510_1777_siri_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nH9583"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22163752/ios-14-3-proraw-airpods-max-fitness-plus-available-now-download"&gt;yesterday’s release of iOS 14.3&lt;/a&gt;, Siri got a new trick: the ability to play real-world sound samples on command. Ask “Hey Siri, what does _____ sound like?” and it will start playing the sound for you. If you ask on an iPhone or iPad, it will show you a picture as well. Google Assistant has been able to do this for a few years now, but now it’s available for the iPhone, iPad, and HomePod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g02Lar"&gt;Apple hasn’t announced how many sounds it’s added, but it’s been able to handle most of the animals I asked about (except for some obscure ones that I’m not sure have a real distinctive noise, like an anteater). At the moment, it seems like the sounds are limited to animals, vehicles, and musical instruments. I tried asking for some nature-y sounds, such as thunder or a waterfall, and Siri didn’t play anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yPvTa"&gt;This feature is probably best heard, rather than read about, so I made a video in which I ask Siri to play different sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q1WYBe"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Siri Sounds|99868" data-volume-uuid="05c0ff26a" data-volume-id="99868" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-525" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I asked Siri what several things and animals sound like. (Warning: this may activate any iOS devices if they have “Hey Siri” turned on.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sm5Q31"&gt;Interestingly, it’s got samples for different breeds of dog, so you can hear what a mastiff sounds like compared to a Shih Tzu. There are obviously quite a few things that Siri doesn’t have sound samples for, and in some cases (like when I asked what humans sound like), it doesn’t even try. As you can tell from the end of the video, Siri is Siri — technical imperfections and all. (At one point, Siri started answering the question, stopped, said it was sorry, and restarted its answer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1MlQw"&gt;I know I’m going to be asking Siri for random sounds every now and then, trying to figure out what it has sounds for and what it doesn’t. If you’re not as easily amused as I am, the feature could also be useful if you have kids, who I’ve heard are always asking what things sound like. It’s also useful for when someone in your household says that foxes sound like people screaming, and you just have to know if they’re right. (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/zBpZTo1dlPM?t=24"&gt;Here’s a YouTube link&lt;/a&gt; so you can see as well as hear it.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Office is now updated for M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ccwbq_gLy_s8NDH890Y5RM_1ZIA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517274/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y1GLPv"&gt;If you’ve been using Microsoft Office on an M1 Mac, it’s about to get better — &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2F4-ways-microsoft-365-is-improving-the-experience-for-mac-users%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft is announcing an update&lt;/a&gt; today that brings native support for Apple’s new custom chip architecture to the Windows productivity suite. The apps getting the updates are Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Notably absent, however, is Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIdd2Z"&gt;The updates are making the apps universal ones — meaning these versions will run on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, so any upcoming updates or features will be coming at the same time for both platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXhJja"&gt;If you’re a heavy user of Teams, you may be disappointed to hear that it hasn’t been included in today’s rollout of updates. Microsoft promises they’re working on that platform in their blog post, but the company hasn’t announced any sort of timeline. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s main communications competitor, Slack, has native support available &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slackeng/status/1326237727667314688"&gt;in a public beta&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like you’ll have to stick with the emulated version for now, if your team uses Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KAl3i"&gt;Office users who have automatic updates turned on should have the new versions sometime today, and anyone else can update it through the Mac App Store or Microsoft’s AutoUpdate software (depending on if you downloaded Office through the App Store or directly from Microsoft). Outlook users will get not only native Apple Silicon support, but support for iCloud accounts as well, allowing them to sync their email, contacts, and calendars to the app if they use Apple’s service to store them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad’s new leather MacBook Pro sleeves are luxurious but pricey</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B23XwTLixrhWFayQZQMAtkaQSDg=/114x0:1926x1208/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516593/Untitled_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="khMIkp"&gt;Accessory company Nomad is expanding its case lineup once again with its first &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Flaptop-sleeve-horween-leather-rustic-brown-macbookpro-16-inch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2F22176171%2Fnomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro sleeves&lt;/a&gt;, available today. The cases might be the nicest that Nomad has made so far, but with a starting price of $229.95 (for the 13-inch model) and $249.95 (for 16-inch MacBook Pros), they’re also the most expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8gWsh"&gt;The MacBook Pro cases are made out of the same brown Horween leather that Nomad uses for most of its products. But instead of the plastic shell the company uses on its iPhone cases (which I’m less of a fan of), the new cases are just solid expanses of leather on the outside, backed by EVA foam to keep your computer safe, with a final layer of microfiber cloth for the interior. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pCv-YUSEApsGPFEllca5PMHQq3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171815/_DSC7173.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C charging cutout on the side of the Nomad MacBook Sleeve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Kj282O"&gt;I’ve been able to use one of the cases for the past few days, and I’ve been pretty impressed by the quality. The leather looks and feels great, and Nomad has been pretty thoughtful about some of the details, like the hidden magnetic snaps that keep the case shut or the small cutout on the side that allows for accessing the USB-C ports for charging or docking your laptop while it’s still in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EtRlf"&gt;Sliding a MacBook in or out of the case is easy, and the case itself feels solid enough, although there are likely more durable options, if protection is the number one priority — especially given the cost. Additionally, as an owner of a MacBook Pro with just two USB-C ports, I did have to think about which direction I was placing my laptop inside the case to line up the ports with the charging cutout. And while that cutout is useful, I did have some concerns that it would provide a good avenue for dust or debris to make its way inside the case over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWVl91"&gt;Given the current state of the world, I haven’t been able to extensively test how the leather holds up in the stress of a daily commute, but the company does promise that the exterior should develop a nice patina over time, similar to its other cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgfHcI"&gt;The leather laptop cases are designed specifically to fit Apple’s 13-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros (from the 2016-era design), although you’ll likely be able to fit other similarly sized laptops, too. Just be aware that it might be a bit tighter or looser than you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KlSBF"&gt;The cases are available now on Nomad’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A show about Gawker proved too hot for Apple to handle</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBwXnT"&gt;Apple has killed an upcoming Apple TV Plus show about &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt;, a now-defunct news organization, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/business/media/apple-gawker-tim-cook.html"&gt;a report by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The show, called &lt;em&gt;Scraper&lt;/em&gt;, is one to add to the list of stories about Apple killing projects that touch things that are too sensitive or edgy for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpiG4e"&gt;When Tim Cook found out that Apple was working on the show, he reportedly sent an email saying that he was surprised to hear about it. He also mentioned he disliked Gawker. Although Apple has decided to kill the project, the show is back on the market, where another distributor could buy and finance it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iUD5oT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple executives have stepped in to steer their TV service away from controversy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qJbxxa"&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple executives have stepped in to steer their TV service away from controversy. In 2018 Apple reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-sex-please-were-apple-iphone-giant-seeks-tv-success-on-its-own-terms-1537588880"&gt;killed a movie about Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt; for having gratuitous violence and sex, and Apple executive Eddy Cue has reportedly said that the service will never do two things: “hardcore nudity and China”. Apple directed show-runners to avoid portraying China in a negative light, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/apple-china-tv-protesters-hong-kong-tim-cook"&gt;Buzzfeed has reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqxZkY"&gt;The executive who bought the show, Layne Eskridge, is leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unkwOG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; was inherently controversial — as Tim Cook personally knew. &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; outed him as gay in 2008. The Gawker Media Group&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;included several blogs; in 2010, one of them, &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-apple-lost-the-iphone-4-5520438"&gt;found and leaked the iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt; before it was launched. (Later, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/police-seize-jason-chens-computers-5524843"&gt;the reporter’s home was raided by police.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1QCL6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; is appealing as a show precisely because the blog has such a mixed legacy. It was one of the media outlets that &lt;a href="https://gawker.com/who-wants-to-remember-bill-cosbys-multiple-sex-assaul-1515923178"&gt;revived interest in Bill Cosby&lt;/a&gt;, who was later convicted of aggravated indecent assault. It also reported on rumored misconduct by Louis CK and &lt;a href="http://defamer.gawker.com/tell-us-what-you-know-about-harvey-weinsteins-open-sec-1695071092"&gt;Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JAHlR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker &lt;/em&gt;alums Max Read and Cord Jefferson are attached to the show. Jefferson has also written for &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Good Place&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Master of None. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVk0I9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt;, it seems, was born to bring controversy to everything it touched — even four years after its death.&lt;/p&gt;
