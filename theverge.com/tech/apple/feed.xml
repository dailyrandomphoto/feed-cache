    <title>Listen to the sick Mac sound effect song that Apple opened its keynote with </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uY6Pp8hTo7Xm_ldpHYleUyJF9-g=/284x0:2114x1220/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012561/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_5.41.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zIA9kE"&gt;Apple kicked off its MacBook Pro keynote a little differently today: with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxJpZtp2ItE"&gt;sweet remix of classic Apple sound effects&lt;/a&gt; from the past 45 years of the company’s history, created by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0dvX0R4NEh6cmxKUFFXdDlXT3pxblpjSUVWZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttQmtJOGJHZ1NiTmVBazdlTG80dkV0MnBuQUU0OFhKR3J0RVlpNUZWM0xiNHkySjA2RWRkTnU5SVI0c1psN2tkYnlsY3dxal9JVEtkR2lfdTl6N21UcUlFSGJWbWZKOEc2WWVXSWNsX0FRbU5WTi1USQ&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.co%2FAGCook"&gt;artist A. G. Cook&lt;/a&gt; — using Apple’s Pro Display XDR, MacBook Pro, and Logic Pro, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49Hal6"&gt;The song itself is called “Start Up” and is a surprisingly chill listening experience. The video’s fun, too, featuring a wide array of Apple hardware from throughout the years, including old iBooks and the sadly defunct iPod Hi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQUcqRr25H-9Yj4KSE-TIFRE2bE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936838/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_5.41.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bPBWkV"&gt;The full list of sound effects trend toward Apple’s more recent hardware, of course, but there are a few classic Easter eggs, too. The full list of sound effects, provided by Apple, is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="keslCD"&gt;iMac G3 startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WsFibI"&gt;MacBook Pro startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8gUMox"&gt;AirPods case closing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iENqaM"&gt; iOS alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="19KsE9"&gt;HomePod minimum volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QkTl69"&gt;iPod click wheel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N08tNj"&gt;Note alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QK6g0W"&gt;Email whoosh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MtJxRE"&gt;MagSafe charger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pcRSta"&gt;Night Owl ringtone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gs0nFn"&gt;HomePod Nope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UyL7mt"&gt;HomePod PingPong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J08BLz"&gt;Mac 2020 alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FARvhE"&gt;Empty trash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YyUbTW"&gt;Message sent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qiy8Gm"&gt;Message received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7JEF8v"&gt;HomePod device identify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zRWhne"&gt;iPhone keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y3ZnEt"&gt;AirDrop invite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0pdpSj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosumi"&gt;Mac Sosumi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VW7GQZ"&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Hli3FT"&gt;It’s fitting that Cook (no relation to Apple’s CEO) would produce today’s Apple remix, given that he released his second album, &lt;em&gt;Apple&lt;/em&gt; (no relation to the multitrillion-dollar tech company) in 2020. It’s not clear whether Apple and Cook will release “Start Up” on Apple Music — which, admittedly, would make a lot of sense — but you can enjoy Cook’s chill tech-inspired beats here. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder Apple’s third-gen AirPods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2hB74cmpCY1wERDLyyuzjgpGmI=/150x0:1749x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012528/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_10.23.57_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods will be available on October 26th.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQRTjj"&gt;The tech world may be abuzz regarding the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22488779"&gt;14-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22491254"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22435385"&gt;new AirPods&lt;/a&gt; — announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22488347"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; today — have also conjured up a storm. Apple has finally announced a new pair of true wireless earbuds set to launch on October 26th for $179, while lowering the price of the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1019575/7613?subId1=Verge3rdGenAirpods101821&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMV7N2AM%2FA%2Fairpods-with-charging-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;entry-level AirPods 2 to $129&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZDatb"&gt;As expected, the third-generation AirPods mirror their sleeker sibling, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in its new design and in some functionality, barring the active noise cancellation. For the first time since 2016, the AirPods include a wider, Pro-like charging case and shorter steams. They also boast Pro features like Adaptive EQ, which customizes your audio experience, and an intuitive force sensor for media control. Apple has also added support for the same head-tracking capabilities found on the AirPods Pro and Airpods Max, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, which allows for a more immersive experience when listening to select content Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUy7GJ"&gt;Unlike their predecessor, the latest AirPods are sweat- and water-resistant and are compatible with Apple’s MagSafe charging system. The tech giant additionally claims the increased battery life on the third-gen model provides up to six hours of continuous playback, or 30 with the included charging case. Of course, we haven’t tested these claims out just yet, but we do plan to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FU11P7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="MQ9byn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to preorder the third-gen AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0nGZr4"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;last-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, which were available without a wireless charging case, the newest model is only available in a single configuration for $179. That’s $20 less than the second-gen AirPods with a wireless charging case launched for in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KtwnM"&gt;If you’re considering buying the new AirPods ahead of launch, you can preorder them &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1019575/7613?subId1=Verge3rdGenAirpods101821&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMME73AM%2FA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting today at the Apple Store&lt;/a&gt;. They will be available on Tuesday, October 26th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly added a MagSafe charging case to its AirPods Pro, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gEqvGhOvHFVtieZ5tn9_1SCciYE=/0x42:2124x1458/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012470/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_2.19.16_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N6gGM1"&gt;Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;announced its third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; with a new charging case that works with its MagSafe magnetic charging system, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/introducing-the-next-generation-of-airpods/"&gt;also quietly announced&lt;/a&gt; that, starting today, it’ll also be including the new case with its pricier &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLWK3AM/A/airpods-pro"&gt;$250 AirPods Pro model&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jbgpnx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple announces third-generation AirPods for $179","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jdpqCs"&gt;The new case doesn’t claim to charge Apple’s AirPod products any faster; it just has the magnets needed to attach to Apple’s MagSafe charging puck for easier alignment when charging. AirPods already worked with MagSafe, thanks to the broader Qi charging spec, so it’s more of a slight convenience than anything else, but it's good to see Apple expanding MagSafe to more products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcnnGc"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple also isn’t taking the opportunity here to add a reverse wireless charging feature to its AirPods lineup, even though MagSafe seems to be the perfect opportunity and way to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWHJD5"&gt;For now, it doesn’t seem that Apple is selling the new MagSafe Charging Case as a standalone accessory, either, which means that you’ll have to pick up a new pair of headphones to be able to take advantage of the magnetic charging functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOxgi6"&gt;Apple first introduced the AirPods Pro in late 2019; the wireless headphones offer interchangeable tips and active noise cancellation technology but otherwise haven’t really changed dramatically in the two years since they’ve been released. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new 14-inch MacBook Pro with a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8Gu1yCl8X5f8qVymayXFLwwadY=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012007/1Rm4aV2YiD.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzYFl7"&gt;Apple has announced a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which now includes a 14-inch screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;Apple’s new M1 Pro and Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;a notch&lt;/a&gt;, squared-off design, and a wider selection of ports in addition to the standard Thunderbolt ones — it brings back the HDMI port and SD card reader and adds a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;MagSafe 3 connector&lt;/a&gt; for charging (though you can also charge it with the Thunderbolt ports if your house is littered with USB-C power bricks). It starts at $1,999 and &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/2r5oMg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can be ordered “today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDMM04"&gt;It has a 14.2-inch 120Hz ProMotion Mini LED display, which Apple is branding as “Liquid Retina Pro XDR.” It has slimmer bezels than the previous generation but also includes a notch, which houses a 1080p webcam but not Apple’s Face ID system. Resolution-wise, the 14-inch model runs at 3024 by 1964, and it can run at 1,000 nits sustained brightness and 1,600 nits peak brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Us2bE3UcOL_fZMs34b7JaofcLbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936646/lcimg_dbbf28e3_568c_48d1_8c66_10c4149e89fe.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The notch brings a better webcam, and pros that need fixed refresh rates can turn off ProMotion in settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jWI2Zn"&gt;You can configure the 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s new M1 Pro or M1 Max chips. Both can feature 10 CPU cores — the Pro can have a 14- or 16-core GPU, while the Max has 24- and 32-core GPU options. The new MacBook Pro comes with 16GB of RAM standard, and you can upgrade to 32GB with the M1 Pro or 64 GB with the M1 Max. However, the M1 Pro included with the $1,999 base model is a trimmed-down version of the CPU — it only features eight CPU cores and 14 GPU cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XOnh3j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The $1,999 model has caveats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RKRmYm"&gt;The base also comes with a weaker 67W power adapter — to upgrade to the “real” M1 Pro with 10 CPU cores and 16 GPU cores, you’re looking at spending at least $2,300 before tax (and that model will come with a 512GB SSD). There’s also the $2,499 pre-built model, which comes with the fully loaded M1 Pro, a 1TB SSD, and a 96W charger (though the upgraded charger is included in the base model if you configure a CPU upgrade). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAsG6B"&gt;In addition to all the new (well, returning) ports, the 14-inch MacBook Pro adds a third Thunderbolt port compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;its 13-inch counterpart&lt;/a&gt;. The Thunderbolt ports are now Thunderbolt 4, an upgrade from the Thunderbolt 3 ports on the previous models. The 14-inch also includes a “high-fidelity” speaker system, and a headphone jack that supports “high impedance” headphones, though &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/specs/"&gt;Apple’s spec page&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t specify how many Ohms that translates to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMzX0"&gt;The redesign is the first major one in Apple’s pro laptop lineup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;since 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the year that brought ill-fated butterfly keyboards, the Touch Bar, and Thunderbolt 3 as the standard and only port type (with the exception of a headphone jack, of course). It also marks the return of the midsize 14-inch screen, which Apple hasn’t put on a laptop since the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook#iBook_G4_(%22Snow%22)"&gt;2005 iBook G4&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1E8rLf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros are an about-face from Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj4XB1"&gt;Compared to that redesign, though, Apple’s new laptops seem to be an about-face — the 2016 redesign ditched the ports, and now they’re back. Apple also added the Touch Bar in 2016, and that’s also been replaced by a set of function keys. And the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro had limitations that the 14-inch doesn't — it could only drive one external display, where Apple says that the M1 Pro-equipped MacBook Pro can drive two Pro Display XDRs, and the M1 Max version can drive three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beNUXV"&gt;It’s nice to see Apple more clearly differentiating the smaller MacBook Pros. The lineup has been a bit confusing for the past few years — the two-port MacBook Pro and four-port 13-inch computers were awkwardly lumped together but were pretty different computers with different processors and prices. Now, the screen size difference makes the distinction clear: people looking for portability can get the Air or 13-inch Pro, and the 14-inch Pro exists for those looking for more horsepower. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oYxNKn"&gt;Apple announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; during today’s big hardware event: a $179 set of earbuds that are much closer to the AirPods Pro in terms of features and design. Though, it’s not all bad news if you don’t want to spend that much on AirPods. As a result of this new set, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-2nd-generation/"&gt;Apple has permanently slashed the price of its second-gen AirPods that include a wired charging case from $159 to $129&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igazhh"&gt;The model that includes a wireless charging case is no longer available for purchase (through Apple, at least). It does, however, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MR8U2AM/A/wireless-charging-case-for-airpods"&gt;still sell the wireless charging case separately for $79&lt;/a&gt;, but I really wouldn’t encourage buying that versus just getting the new, third-generation AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsbtCu"&gt;Apple currently has a lineup of AirPods that starts at $129 and goes all the way up to $549 for the AirPods Max. But if your budget leans more on the affordable end than the premium side of Apple’s portable audio business, you might be happy to know that you can commonly find this second-gen set for even less than Apple’s new $129 price. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Right now, they’re $119 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/10/7/22713078/apple-airpods-beats-google-nest-mini-gigabyte-gaming-laptop-zelda-deal-sale"&gt;just a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;, the price was parked at just $109. If you can hang on until November 10th, Walmart will be selling them in a pre-Black Friday deal for just $89. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 8 biggest announcements from Apple’s Unleashed event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OfDU8_9BVz4X7gZiilIOCbROSGc=/156x0:1320x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012195/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_10.02.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="txvrRb"&gt;Apple has just finished its October 2021 event, which was full of news and announcements from the company — including the long-awaited M1-equipped MacBook Pros. There was a whole lot of news, so if you want to get caught up on the biggest updates from the show, you can catch up with our roundup right here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBf07U1f3SfXY1GBn0qf4vnlNZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936637/1Rm4aV2YiD.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oDUSLU"&gt;Apple announced two MacBook Pros with an all-new design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6PJZD2"&gt;Apple revealed a brand-new set of MacBook Pros, available in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; models. The Touch Bar is gone, replaced with a full-size function row. Many ports are back; there’s an HDMI port, three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card slot, a headphone jack, and the return of the MagSafe charger. The 14-inch model starts at $1,999, while the 16-inch model starts at $2,499. They will be &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/2r5oMg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to preorder Monday&lt;/a&gt; ahead of availability next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8EtEO"&gt;And you might notice one thing at the top of the new laptops...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BXCdp6RCX3z2eHAgNLW-3ti8wZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936649/lcimg_dbbf28e3_568c_48d1_8c66_10.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at that notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sGfu6w"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;The new MacBook Pros have a notch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gWfZo4"&gt;Apple has brought over the notch design from the iPhone to the new MacBook Pros, though it houses an improved 1080p FaceTime camera. Let the notch debates begin anew. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple announced the M1 Pro chip on Monday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="TInW4E"&gt;

&lt;p id="MipQsG"&gt;Apple announced its next two custom chips, dubbed the M1 Pro and M1 Max. They seem like they’ll be beefy chips, as Apple says the Pro has more than 33 billion transistors, while the Max has 57 billion transistors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HqOev_42l88bd058rnxYl2c8O0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936672/lcimg_c10580c7_99e5_4c68_aa75_9ad82322596e.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p id="KnVovk"&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros use the company’s adaptive refresh rate technology, ProMotion, topping out at up to 120Hz refresh rates. They’re also lit by Mini LEDs, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="D1H6yk"&gt;Apple’s beloved MagSafe magnetic charger is back with the new MacBook Pros. Apple is calling it MagSafe 3. The company says the new computers can charge up to 50 percent in 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HKCg1OBx1T-M1e7Xd8zlVn1F94g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936558/lcimg_7a256b51_4297_4b70_a2f6_c52dcd574ef5.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p id="bMB5j7"&gt;Apple launched a new version of its popular AirPods headphones. They look a lot like the AirPods Pro, but they don’t have interchangeable tips. The new headphones support spatial audio and are sweat- and water-resistant. You can &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/EaeLJe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder them Monday for $179&lt;/a&gt;, and they will be available next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="odGqjI"&gt;Apple is introducing new colors to the HomePod Mini — the smart speaker will now also be available in yellow, orange, and blue. They’ll retail for the same &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/kjMyZn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99 price starting in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Vq49Yq"&gt;Apple launched a new Apple Music Voice Plan, which lets you access Apple Music with Siri. It will cost $4.99 per month and will be available later this fall in 17 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey is officially launching on October 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/orse-py0bHdXG97r9KiIu70nQRs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012089/akrales_20210515_4583_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LjQqvB"&gt;Following several beta releases, Apple announced that the next version of its macOS software, macOS Monterey, is about to release. It’ll be rolling out as an update starting on Monday, October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Dr8m8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin previewed the public beta software&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, highlighting Monterey’s improvements to Facetime. The software will bring other exciting features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;SharePlay and Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, which will enable Mac and iPad users to move files seamlessly between devices, but perhaps not at launch. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/"&gt;In its press release for the new, redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, Apple says that those features are coming “later this fall.” Additionally, Apple made significant tweaks to Safari, its own web browser, for Monterey, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;it has since toned down some of the changes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 MacBook Pros are the first with mini LED 120Hz refresh displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MqkmUqKiGp2FPD73T754i2UGx4=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012080/lcimg_81296345_e747_40c4_9960_c33954de9718.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nv7fDm"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;has just announced&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, powered by its newly revealed M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, and featuring a huge jump in display technology for the company’s laptops, with Mini LED displays that support Apple’s 120Hz ProMotion technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncpost-list-post-content-2857077"&gt;The larger 16-inch MacBook Pro has a 16.2-inch display with a 3456 x 2234 resolution, while the 14-inch model has a 14.2-inch panel at 3024 x 1964. Both sizes feature the same Mini LED technology that Apple debuted on the iPad Pro earlier this year, which offers local dimming on a level beyond traditional LED displays (although it’s still not quite on the level of OLED panels used by competitors like Samsung.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncpost-list-post-content-2857105"&gt;The new displays also feature Apple’s 120Hz “ProMotion” technology, which allows for faster refresh rates. Apple says that the computers will automatically adjust the refresh rate based on what you’re doing (for example, dropping the refresh rate when your screen is static). It’ll also offer the option for users to set locked in refresh rates, which is important for video editing or other use cases that rely on specific screen settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWbfsB"&gt;The new Mini LED screens are brighter, too, offering 1000 nits of sustained brightness with 1600 peak brightness and a 1 million to 1 contrast ratio, and the same Liquid Retina XDR that Apple uses for its Pro Display XDR monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dZtBLSYqGtW50E00yitrJXFp4o4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936684/lcimg_c10580c7_99e5_4c68_aa75_9ad82322596e.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQrEvE"&gt;The new displays also offer thinner bezels, although that comes at a cost: a iPhone-style &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;notch for the main camera&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="52peMg"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;ditched MagSafe five years ago&lt;/a&gt; when it moved to USB-C charging on its new laptops, but MagSafe 3 brings the familiar quick-release connector back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max"&gt;this latest lineup&lt;/a&gt; of MacBook Pro laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk4qTX"&gt;Other than their M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; computers ditch the much-hated Touch Bar in favor of physical keys and bring back the additional ports (HDMI, SDXC) power users love. A less familiar addition is the new notch atop those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733122/apple-macbook-pro-mini-led-display-120hz-promotion-refresh-rates"&gt;Mini LED-packed 120Hz displays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2Nebi"&gt;But for the clumsy people with cable-strewn desks, the return of MagSafe — what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;we’ve seen on iPhones&lt;/a&gt; just isn’t the same — might be the most important feature. According to Apple, the new MacBook Pros can still charge via USB-C also, but the updated MagSafe 3 plug delivers more power than before. Without providing detailed specs, Apple says that with fast charging, the MacBook Pro can charge up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAzV2e"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/specs/"&gt;spec page&lt;/a&gt; reveals that both of the new MacBook Pros will still come with USB-C charging bricks. The 2-meter MagSafe 3 cable has a USB-C plug to plug into the charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="166xfx"&gt;If you order the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, then you can expect to receive a 67W USB-C power adapter if your laptop has an 8-core M1 Pro CPU inside, or a 96W USB-C adapter if you order one with either a 10-core M1 Pro or M1 Max CPU (it’s also available as an optional accessory for the cheaper model). Anyone purchasing a new 16-inch Macbook Pro will get a 140W USB-C charger plus the 2-meter USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces 16-inch MacBook Pro with new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3n76A8lOcCeTxI7UKOuQ0M1CsQ=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012026/lcimg_982af7b3_d14a_4a82_8073_a94b6e73fdd5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2xXc9"&gt;Apple has introduced its new 16-inch MacBook Pro, promising an upgrade in both design and performance. Models &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/NK054v" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will be available&lt;/a&gt; in silver and space gray next week, with a starting price of $2,499.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvKeTJ"&gt;The new Pro is configurable with the M1 Pro and the M1 Max, Apple’s new 10-core processors with eight “high-performance” cores and two “high-efficiency” cores. The M1 Max has double the Pro’s GPU cores (32 to the Pro’s 16) and double the memory bandwidth, as well as 64GB of unified memory (the Pro has 32GB). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyW7Ra"&gt;The chassis has also received a modern redesign. The device is 4.7 pounds and 16.8mm thick, with a 16.2-inch display. The Touch Bar has been replaced by physical keys, and there’s an HDMI port on the right side in addition to a Thunderbolt 4 port and an SDXC slot, with a headphone jack and two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left. It’s the most connectivity we’ve ever seen from a Mac notebook, according to Apple — the M1 Pro model supports up to two Pro Display XDRs, and the M1 Max config can handle up to three in addition to a 4K TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhRU2Y"&gt;The first MacBook Pro 16 debuted in November 2019. It had a very similar design to previous 15-inch MacBook Pros and was powered by Intel’s 9th Gen processors (which are now two generations old). Reviewers praised its outstanding keyboard and audio, in addition to its power, but moaned about the limited connectivity — there were only two Thunderbolt ports on each side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PJKn7"&gt;There’s a new 1080p camera, which Apple says delivers twice the low-light performance of previous MacBook shooters. A new six-speaker sound system supports Spatial Audio, and a Liquid Retina XDR display delivers up to a claimed 1,600 nits of peak brightness. The enclosure is entirely aluminum, and Apple says the new cooling system can move “50 percent more air” than previous MacBooks with lower (and thus, quieter) fan speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UryrZW"&gt;Apple claims the 16-inch Pro will deliver 21 hours of video playback on battery, which is “the longest battery life ever on a Mac notebook”, per the company. Battery results can vary by workload, so we wouldn’t expect most people to see that result — but anything close would be category-topping without a doubt. The MacBook also supports MagSafe 3 and fast charge for easy juicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlngy4"&gt;The M1 Pro and M1 Max have big shoes to fill. The M1 chip that Apple announced last November (which now powers the MacBook Air, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Mac Mini, the iPad Pro, and the 2021 iMac) has blown competing offerings out of the water when it comes to processing power, efficiency, and integrated graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHtxSE"&gt;But customers have been waiting for Apple to release processor workstation machines, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro and a potential successor to the 27-inch iMac. It’s safe to say that many people are eagerly awaiting this MacBook Pro — not just to purchase for themselves but to see whether the M1 Max will take the laptop market by storm in the same way its predecessor did. &lt;/p&gt;
