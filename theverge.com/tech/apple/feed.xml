    <title>Apple’s new iPad Mini is already discounted at Adorama</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini is $25 off today, the first discount we’ve seen on the 8.3-inch tablet.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lqP68B"&gt;At $499, the latest iPad Mini isn’t cheap. Luckily, Adorama is &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?subId1=VergeDeals100621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmk7r3lla.html"&gt;currently taking $25 off&lt;/a&gt; of the 64GB, Wi-Fi-equipped model in all four colorways, bringing the final sale price down to $474. The latest model is equipped with Apple’s new A15 Bionic processor and a 12MP rear camera, not to mention Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; feature, which allows the front-facing camera to digitally pan and zoom in order to keep you in the frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iILOjK"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we also praised the design of the sixth-gen iPad Mini, the larger screen, and the fact that the new tablet offers USB-C support, though, we disliked that it lacks a headphone jack. And while today’s discount isn’t a huge one, it is one of the first we’ve seen on the Apple slate since it launched just over a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PV32lk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKeMiP"&gt;If you’re in need of a stylus, you can pair your discounted iPad Mini with the second-generation Apple Pencil, which is once again &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDealsRoundUp10062021&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Woot&lt;/a&gt; until October 9th, or while supplies last. Typically $129, you can pick the stylus up for $110, which is just $10 more than its best price to date. Amazon Prime members will get free shipping. Unlike its predecessor, the newest Apple Pencil can wirelessly charge while magnetically attached to the side of the latest iPad Pro, iPad Mini, or iPad Air. Note that it will not, however, work with the newest entry-level iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwQZni"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XLZY02"&gt;You can now purchase the best drone under $1,000 for even less at Newegg. DJI’s official Newegg storefront is now offering a refurbished &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeDailyDeals10062021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F380-0002-003U1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI Mavic Air 2 Fly More Combo for $769&lt;/a&gt;, and throwing in a $60 Newegg gift card. Normally $988 when sold new, that equates to $219 in savings. The Mavic Air 2 offers 34 minutes of flight time, as well as a built-in 48MP camera that is far better than that found on its predecessor. The midrange drone also offers features like ActiveTrack 3.0, which automatically follows a subject, as well as improved connectivity. In addition to the drone, the discounted bundle includes an AC power cable, a pair of extra control sticks, a shoulder bag, six low-noise propellers, a battery-to-power bank adapter, a gimbal protector, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21243887/dji-mavic-air-2-2020-drone-flight-photography-video-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6NnCMn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10791622"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e0pq3w"&gt;Apple aficionados, you’re in luck today: we’ve got a third Apple discount for you. Right now, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?subId1=VergeDeals100621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmgyl3ama.html"&gt;Adorama is selling Apple’s AirPods &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/e4ENXr"&gt;Max for $449&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of colors. That’s a $100 discount and one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on what we believe are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now. As noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the AirPods Max boast excellent sound quality, top-of-the-line noise cancellation, and a breathable knit mesh headband canopy that makes them comfortable to wear over long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AAGYen"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9ff9q"&gt;If the $474 iPad Mini above seems too expensive, Amazon is now selling the ad-supported, 32GB version of the latest Amazon Fire HD 10 at its lowest price to date. Normally $150, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BX7FV5L/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can buy it today for $100&lt;/a&gt;, and get a 20 percent extra discount if you trade in select devices. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22578620/amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-productivity-bundle-kids-pro-2021-tablet-review-which-to-buy"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we liked the tablet’s sharp, colorful screen, while noting that it offers good battery life for the price. It’s a good buy if you’re on a budget and would like a tablet strictly for watching movies or consuming Amazon content, however, keep in mind that we may see even steeper discounts as Black Friday approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="833xuZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Verge Tech Survey 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWXX2_W2TVY4Kb4tZJd2CXgcb0U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958423/VRG_ILLO_Verge_2021_tech_survey.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;After a year of the pandemic, we asked Americans if their trust in big tech companies has changed — and if the biggest ones should be broken up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="piUnNR"&gt;In a year of isolation, fear, sickness, and death, the tech industry provided many of the ways people stayed connected. It also made Americans very aware of their reliance on the major tech companies. So have our attitudes toward them shifted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83udey"&gt;Starting in 2017, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has conducted periodic surveys gauging Americans’ attitudes toward the major tech industry; our most recent one was published in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21144680/verge-tech-survey-2020-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;the fall of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, just before life was upended by the novel coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L28OTc"&gt;Though the pandemic has changed a lot of American life, our findings reveal that it mostly hasn’t changed our feelings about tech companies. There are some exceptions, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Qb3RYv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10790939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LzvnWk"&gt;Thirteen percent of respondents who were familiar with the brand had unfavorable opinions of Amazon, compared to just 9 percent in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zOybLS"&gt;The estimation of Facebook and Twitter also fell among people familiar with them — with 34 percent saying they had unfavorable opinions of Facebook, compared to 29 percent in 2020, and 42 saying they had unfavorable opinions of Twitter, compared to 39 percent in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gf8UjH"&gt;More people said Apple had a negative impact on society, but that was still just 9 percent of respondents familiar with the brand, compared to 5 percent in 2020. Facebook and Twitter were also more likely to be viewed as bad for society among those who recognized the brands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mulUXC"&gt;Among people who don’t use Facebook, 43 percent of them are avoiding it because they don’t like how it does business — a jump from 27 percent in the last survey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wC4FNM"&gt;These are surprisingly large shifts in just a year. 2020 was a record profitable year for Amazon as more people relied on it during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ouXbO"&gt;We added a new company, TikTok, to our survey this year: 31 percent of people who recognized the brand say it has a negative impact on our society. Also, it’s the brand people most distrust when it comes to personal information, since 64 percent of respondents say they don’t trust it. Facebook and Instagram are the second and third least-trusted brands when it comes to personal information; in both cases, a majority of respondents indicated that they felt the brands were untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myig0N"&gt;There is also an increased interest in breaking up Big Tech. This year, 61 percent of our respondents said that the government should split up tech companies if they get too big; last year, only 56 percent of people said that. Maybe the pandemic drove home how much we rely on these businesses — and how they can change our lives at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIheF1"&gt;These are among the findings of the third &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Tech Trust Survey. This survey was conducted in August with 1,200 people nationally representative of the US. The sample error is ± 3 percent at a 95 percent level of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbKqT9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvAlm4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It just got much easier to find your lost AirPods Pro or AirPods Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiEaheHIUyePl5myAyfcl8nUEuA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956595/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ynre3Q"&gt;Apple today released a firmware update for its AirPods Pro and AirPods Max that introduces new options for finding the pricey products if you happen to misplace them. These capabilities were first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;promised for iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; but didn’t quite make the launch; thankfully, it didn’t take Apple much longer after that to roll them out. Both &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/05/apple-rolling-out-new-find-my-features-for-airpods-pro-and-airpods-max/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/05/airpods-firmware-find-my-updates/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on today’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CF4dO"&gt;Using Apple’s Find My app, it was already possible to view the location where your AirPods were last paired with your iPhone or play a sound to make them easier to dig out of the couch cushions. But this new update greatly expands that functionality. Now you can activate Lost Mode and have millions of other iPhones, iPads, and Macs aid in the search should your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max go missing. If they come within Bluetooth range of another Apple device, you’ll be alerted to their location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoGMMd"&gt;Apple has also added an AirTags-like “Find Nearby” user interface for tracking down a set of AirPods Pro or AirPods Max if you know they’re somewhere close. Since there’s no U1 chip inside Apple’s earbuds or headphones, it’s not quite as precise as with an AirTag; you don’t see the arrows pointing you towards them, but the onscreen prompts will show statuses like far, near, or “here” when you’re right near them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAYsXz"&gt;Also super helpful: you can now automatically receive a notification if you leave your AirPods behind somewhere. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210515"&gt;support page on the Find My network&lt;/a&gt; explains the various features and how they work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPau41"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple still doesn’t offer any straightforward way to update AirPods firmware. It just sort of &lt;em&gt;happens &lt;/em&gt;randomly when they’re connected to your iPhone. But you can at least check what version you’ve got to see if you’ve got these latest features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B0cZUY"&gt;Go to Settings on your iPhone or iPad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uBfxAq"&gt;Tap General, then About&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="612SpH"&gt;Choose AirPods, and in there, you should see a “firmware version” field. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="giiE1G"&gt;The new update that offers the improved Find My capabilities is version 4A400, so look for that. As for the regular AirPods, they’re still limited to the more basic functionality that was present before. But whenever the long-rumored third-generation AirPods make their debut, hopefully those will also offer the more robust location tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s healthcare division leaned on misleading data, report alleges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iZ93EsHt1XJiciYHKVkgpQsj-AI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955506/acstro_190902_apple_event_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bEcnjw"&gt;Apple employees raising concerns that misleading data was used to support new health products were dismissed or met with hostility, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-health-employees-backlash-misled-executives-2021-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a lack of structure within the health group, along with other organizational problems, is slowing and frustrating the company’s ambitions to push into healthcare, current and former Apple employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDZBVX"&gt;Some concerns focused on clinics Apple set up to both provide healthcare to employees and develop ways to integrate data collected from Apple devices into care. One doctor involved with the project, Will Poe, said in a resignation letter to CEO Tim Cook that he was concerned that members of the team were giving misleading and too-rosy information to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who oversees the company’s health effort, former employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. Poe was concerned that team members told&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Williams that the clinics provided “high-quality” care, even though the quality of care wasn’t being measured in a standardized way, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBlaTQ"&gt;Other employees raised similar concerns to Cook and Williams, &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported, but the company didn’t take any action. “The company does not want help. It is completely happy with the current status quo,” a former employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCUSpb"&gt;Apple claims that parts of the &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;story are based on “outdated” information. The company is still in the “early innings of our work in health technology,” Fred Sainz, a senior director of corporate communications for Apple, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Insider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJH1Uw"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536623/apple-primary-care-project-data-watch-app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from June&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;also outlined issues with the internal health clinics and said that employees were concerned about the way data was collected and presented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QItFMt"&gt;The Apple hardware team’s focus on creating apps and products for consumers, not for medicine, also complicated work by the health team to build a more robust primary care program through the internal clinics, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported. The company began to think of the clinics and their work as a way to drive Apple Watch sales, rather than as their own project, people familiar with the approach told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVL2DQ"&gt;Current and past employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; there is no clear strategy for the health team and that internal culture doesn’t allow for feedback. One doctor working with the clinic’s team had her direct reports removed after speaking up about the clinic’s care and pushing back on Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple and head of the project, in a meeting. A senior engineering program manager was fired soon after saying in a meeting that “some people in the organization preferred telling good stories over accurately representing the data,” former employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMbn0u"&gt;​“Any and all allegations of retaliatory behavior are investigated thoroughly and handled with appropriate corrective actions,” Sainz said in the statement to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “All health leaders encourage employees to always do what’s right, speak up and raise questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="925hYg"&gt;The revelations come as Apple’s overall culture is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest"&gt;starting to shift&lt;/a&gt;, with more employees speaking out about the workplace and pushing for executives to take concerns seriously. “The overarching desire...is that employees want to feel heard,” Zoe Schiffer wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikvpRO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple shares memorial to Steve Jobs on 10th anniversary of his death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ure96Cy3FMUwLBlRAbXTxZs4Eo=/0x32:3650x2465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955046/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_9.13.26_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUpJQu"&gt;Apple is commemorating its co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs’ death with &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;a new short film and a personal statement&lt;/a&gt; from the visionary tech executive’s family. Jobs passed away 10 years ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/6/2473035/apple-steve-jobs-has-died"&gt;on October 5th, 2011&lt;/a&gt;, after a difficult battle with pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9cigZ"&gt;The short film — which has currently taken over Apple’s landing page —  commemorates Jobs’ life in photos, videos, and some of his most iconic quotes, from “the computer is a bicycle for the mind” to the introductions of the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ubqnxz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“People with passion can change the world for the better.”— SJ. Hard to believe it’s been 10 years. Celebrating you today and always. &lt;a href="https://t.co/x2IUnlO7ta"&gt;pic.twitter.com/x2IUnlO7ta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1445358107157221379?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jCdSaA"&gt;Apple also published a statement from Jobs’ family, shared below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="leaHWN"&gt;For a decade now, mourning and healing have gone together. Our gratitude has become as great as our loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8fKy5"&gt;Each of us has found his or her own path to consolation, but we have come together in a beautiful place of love for Steve, and for what he taught us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTR5Gx"&gt;For all of Steve’s gifts, it was his power as a teacher that has endured. He taught us to be open to the beauty of the world, to be curious around new ideas, to see around the next corner, and most of all to stay humble in our own beginner’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xqm0xa"&gt;There are many things we still see through his eyes, but he also taught to look for ourselves. He gave us equipment for living, and it has served us well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vzh3pQ"&gt;One of our greatest sources of consolation has been our association of Steve with beauty. The sight of something beautiful — a wooded hillside, a well‑made object — recalls his spirit to us. Even in his years of suffering, he never lost his faith in the beauty of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yoI2b"&gt;Memory is inadequate for what is in our hearts: we miss him profoundly. We were blessed to have him as husband and father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ALJz1L"&gt;Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/the-steve-jobs-deal-with-dell-that-could-have-changed-apple-and-tech-history/?utm_source=reddit.com"&gt;spoke to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about his work with Jobs. “You can’t be following the rules and making amazing things happen. Steve was certainly exceptional in that regard,” Dell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPevOE"&gt;Tim Cook, Jobs’ successor as CEO, shared his thoughts with Apple employees via a companywide memo, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/read-tim-cook-s-staff-memo-on-10th-anniversary-of-jobs-s-death?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “[Steve] challenged us to see the world not for what it was, but for what it could be,” Cook writes. “I feel so lucky that we spend our days creating wildly innovative tools that connect people, inspire them to think differently, and empower them to make their own dent in the universe, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTFyfe"&gt;Jony Ive, Jobs’ close friend, collaborator, and Apple’s former chief design officer offered his memories of Jobs yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jony-ive-steve-jobs-memories-10th-anniversary-11633354769?mod=e2tw"&gt;in an editorial for &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;My understanding of him refuses to remain cozy or still,” Ive writes. “He truly believed that by making something useful, empowering and beautiful, we express our love for humanity ... I miss Steve desperately and I will always miss not talking with him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jqdt2"&gt;Apple’s memorial video is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;available to view on its site&lt;/a&gt;. For more information on Jobs and Apple’s outsized impact on the world at large, you should listen to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/land-of-the-giants-podcast"&gt;the current (fifth) season of &lt;em&gt;Land of the Giants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuZNzz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 5th, 2:03PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Tim Cook’s memo from &lt;/em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;em&gt;and tweet from Cook sharing Apple’s memorial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaNqWaV5j4cx0WB5BjSpqEwDxr4=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949627/Apple_watch_series7_availability_stainless_steel_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 features larger screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAQ6pp"&gt;Like clockwork, Apple announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; model at its September “California Streaming” event alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The Apple Watch Series 7 is the latest flagship and sits atop Apple’s current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios. After Apple’s initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;the new models are set to release on October 15th&lt;/a&gt;, and you can preorder them on &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt; beginning Friday, October 8th at 5AM PT / 8AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWzYHy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We will update this post as more retailers open up preorder listings, as well as Apple’s own direct links and finalized pricing for the full Series 7 range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LuD92a"&gt;What’s New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="roSEq8"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 prominently features that new, larger display that stretches the screen closer to the edges for a more full-bleed aesthetic and showing more actionable information at once. It has a slight curve at its farthest edges, though Apple says the watch is overall more durable thanks to a 50 percent thicker glass cover and IP6X rating for better dirt and sand resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RLkrZ"&gt;New watch faces exclusive to the Series 7 promise to put that extra screen real estate to work, while the watch maintains a physical footprint that is close to its predecessor. Apple has also improved charging speeds, including a new USB-C wireless magnetic fast charger with the watch that it claims will offer up to a 33 percent quicker charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lttaJ7"&gt;On the software side, the Apple Watch Series 7 runs watchOS 8, supports a full swiping keyboard for text input, is compatible with new workouts, and maintains all the health-tracking features found on prior iterations: sleep tracking, heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and fall detection that now registers during workouts. There is plenty to take advantage of if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch and prefer to have Apple’s latest and greatest iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LxippD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="TraF9d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0ZdgqF"&gt;The aluminum-encased Series 7 watches come in midnight, starlight, an updated blue, (PRODUCT) RED, and a new dark green colorway, so there is a bit to choose from whether you’re going for a discreet, bold, or rugged look. Let’s break down all that there is to offer here before we dive further into specific configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FWKvlA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10743503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s2wxGivMl3xRoA_Lx7GJydjaaKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900348/Apple_watch_series7_availability_aluminum_10052021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 in midnight, starlight, green, blue, and PRODUCT (RED).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ixNYqI"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yBbMqA"&gt;With the impending release of the Apple Watch Series 7, you will be able to preorder your preferred configuration direct from Apple starting October 8th at 5AM PT / 8AM ET. The main options for you to decide on, aside from your preferred color, are size and connectivity. The base Apple Watch Series 7 configuration is a 41mm, GPS-only model that retails for $399. If the Series 7 follows the same pricing convention as the Series 6, you should be able to outfit the 41mm version with a cellular connection for $100 more. If you have a larger wrist or prefer bigger screens, the 45mm GPS-only model will most likely run $429, while its cellular-equipped counterpart climbs up to $529. We will confirm these Series 7 prices and update as soon as Apple announces pricing beyond the starting $399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iin96H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uoprLg"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 from phone carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3dbtKG"&gt;Most major phone carriers in the USA will also offer the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 for preorder, which can help if you prefer to purchase the smartwatch on a monthly installment plan you might already have for your phone. We anticipate Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all offering the Series 7 in each of its colors at the same starting price as Apple for its cellular models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxgiN"&gt;Apple has confirmed that when you &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 through its own store&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-14498937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/applewatch/SID/https://www.att.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint / T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, you will get $100 back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g50QyqEKJq0rPdmM51JUYxdmD-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900357/Apple_watch_series7_availability_hermes_10052021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Edition with Hermès strap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VH7yJz"&gt;More premium case options and custom configurator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T46tsH"&gt;Apple has also offered the latest top-end watch in additional case materials for years. This generation is no different, with Apple confirming the Series 7 is to be sold in stainless steel and titanium finishes, as well as band options from luxury fashion boutique Hermès. The easiest way to preorder these is &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, as not all retailers sell the more luxurious watches, and most people opt for the aluminum models, which offer the same functionality at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR4t55"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fstudio%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s own online boutique for outfitting the exact custom configuration of Apple Watch a customer chooses, makes a return for the Series 7. If you prefer an Apple Watch in a particular combination of size, finish, color, and band, you can make your selection and pay the configured price directly from Apple. This is the only way to order one of the popular solo loop straps with your Apple Watch, as those fixed-length straps are only sold through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some must-have Nintendo Switch games are $20 off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OP-wdeSftWgDpWegiGTX6IdzBPg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948046/MHRISE_Gathering_Hub_Canteen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlBczm"&gt;This is a big week for the Nintendo Switch. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;Switch with an OLED screen and &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launch Friday, October 8th. Whether you’re a Switch veteran, or you’re prepping for your first console with the $350 OLED model, there are some excellent deals on must-have, cartridge-based titles you should know about. &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; are each $20 off. Amazon is the only retailer honoring this deal for all three games, but Best Buy and Walmart are hosting some deals, too. &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is $20 off, but only at GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KSEqI"&gt;All of these are noteworthy deals because they’re rarely discounted games. Nintendo sometimes hosts price cuts, but only for a select batch of games — many of which have been available since the Switch launched a handful of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MRMOxx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10660223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MDXV7k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10241211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6aOgty"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10283625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="0EdGQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10415477"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ga2waH"&gt;Outside of Nintendo’s world, the Apple AirPods Pro are back down to one of their lowest prices yet. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling these wireless earbuds for $179&lt;/a&gt;, down from their normal $249 price. It’s not tough to find a decent deal on this model, but it rarely goes below this price point, outside of Black Friday, at least. In case you didn’t know, these high-end AirPods have active noise cancellation, excellent sound quality, and their case can charge via Lightning or wirelessly on a Qi charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4EcugC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="wEebVp"&gt;If over-ear headphones are more your style, the Beats Studio 3 noise-canceling headphones in a few colorways are steeply discounted at Amazon. Originally $350, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio3-Wireless-Over%E2%80%91Ear-Headphones/dp/B085296FLT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some of the color options are available today for $170&lt;/a&gt;. This model released in 2017, and just like the first AirPods, they feature the W1 wireless chip that makes connecting to (and switching between) Apple devices a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 includes a bigger display.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DEXMH2"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-watch-series-7-orders-start-friday-october-8/"&gt;is opening up preorders&lt;/a&gt; for its Apple Watch Series 7 on Friday, October 8th, with the devices set to ship on October 15th. Apple first revealed the Watch Series 7 at an event last month, but the company simply said it would be available later this fall. Preorders for the Apple Watch Series 7 will now begin at 5AM PT / 8AM ET on Friday, October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4rsJI"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 includes a display&lt;/a&gt; that goes virtually to the edge of the case, with more rounded corners and a softer design. The Series 7 now comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes, up 1mm from the Series 6. The bezels around the display are just 1.7mm, and the always-on mode is 70 percent brighter than the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vKofr0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"},{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Contour watchface for the Watch Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CqsEmC"&gt;Apple has also created a variety of new watchfaces to take advantage of the larger screens on the Apple Watch Series 7. An improved modular watchface lets you view activity ring details alongside the regular complications found on the regular modular watchface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCCHDc"&gt;The screen size is really the big change to the Apple Watch Series 7, alongside watchOS 8 improvements like better outdoor cycling support, fall support in workouts, and some Fitness Plus upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NqShL"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 will start at $399 and will be sold alongside the Watch Series 3 at $199. If you buy a Watch equipped with cellular service, whether through Apple.com or directly from a carrier, there’s also a $100 rebate available after activation with T-Mobile/Sprint or Verizon. Preorders for the Apple Watch Series 7 start on October 8th, and devices will start shipping on October 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zALDC9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 10:45AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information regarding cellular activation and rebates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, Siri is my favorite smart home controller and here’s why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v1fKRWFS8SYv0MquROlM6mooZSA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947472/dseifert_201107_4281_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hey Siri, turn my home on.”&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Speed, brevity, and an abject failure at fart jokes make Apple’s AI voice assistant the winner in my smart home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WPTvnX"&gt;I use a fairly simple metric to determine which artificially intelligent voice assistant is the best for controlling my smart home: Which one do I swear at the least? Apple’s Siri, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22468274"&gt;which turns 10 today&lt;/a&gt;, wins hands down. This is slightly to do with the fact it rarely spews useless information at me when it didn’t understand what I was asking (*cough* Google) and definitely because it never asks if I want to buy something (you know who you are). But mainly, it’s because as a smart home controller, Siri is seriously fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49IGjx"&gt;Siri, you say? That same Siri whose lagginess is legendary in its native iPhone home? Yes, that’s the one. Bring Siri into your home, put the power of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517945/apple-homepod-mini-homekit-smart-home-system-gateway-price"&gt;HomePod&lt;/a&gt; (maxi or mini) behind it as a HomeKit hub, and the snappiness with which the AI does what you command will floor you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26UCCw"&gt;A simple, “Hey Siri, Good Night” turns off all the smart lights in my home, locks the front and back doors, closes the garage door, pauses any music playing, lowers the shades, and sets the thermostat to my sleep temperature in around 6 seconds, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh1Q62"&gt;A quick “Hey Siri, lights on” directed at the kitchen HomePod Mini turns just those lights on in under a second. As a bonus, it has never once accidentally illuminated the whole house at 5AM, as some other voice assistants have unhelpfully done (I mentioned the swearing already, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zORgUx"&gt;A whispered “Good Morning” into my Apple Watch while pressing the digital crown, and my home springs gently back to life; turning on just the lights I need to get ready without waking up my partner and playing NPR quietly on the kitchen Mini, all before I’ve made it out of the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="egleSZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hey, Alexa. Hey Siri. Hey Google. Hey, can anybody hear me??&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9Ac9k"&gt;Siri may lack some of the excellent qualities found on competing smart speakers.  It’s not the smartest AI — that goes to Google Assistant with its powerhouse backend. It’s not the most helpful — that goes to Alexa with its frequent (and frequently unsolicited) offers of assistance. But when all what you want to do is turn the lights on and instead your AI launches into a monologue about who invented the light switch, that’s when you say to yourself, “I wish my smart home controller was a little dumber.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qaodwa"&gt;While the smart home dream is one powered by artificial intelligence that uses context to anticipate your every need, we are a long way from that reality. Today, all you really need from your smart home voice control are listening skills and comprehension — we’re talking first grade here, not a master’s degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdTZeY"&gt;To be helpful, voice control in the smart home just has to be easier and less obtrusive than pulling out a phone and opening an app, and more convenient than walking over to flip a switch. It’s a challenge and one that Apple is the closest to conquering — in my home at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RBU0iX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I do wish Siri was more promiscuous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sPRgrc"&gt;Yes, fart jokes are fun, and it’s great to have the world’s knowledge just a few words away — Siri is no good at either of those things. But Siri does hear me 100 percent of the time, even when the closest speaker is on the other side of the room, understands my smart home requests 95 percent of the time, and limits its chatty banter to the absolute minimum — “On it” or “Coming right up.” These are qualities I admire in a smart home controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5Q26x"&gt;However, I do wish Siri was more promiscuous. There are a fair number of gadgets and gizmos in my admittedly out-of-the-norm smart home that can’t talk to Siri. This means I occasionally find a member of my household standing haplessly in the middle of the room saying, “Hey, Alexa. Hey Siri. Hey Google. Hey, can anybody hear me??”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojs8L5"&gt;It was also not a simple nor inexpensive process to set up my partly-Siri-powered smart home. (The nature of my job means I’m contractually obliged to run all four smart voice assistants at once — yes, I have Bixby in here too). Searching for Siri-compatible devices generally means choosing the “highest-priced” filter in the search results and closing your eyes when you hit that buy button. A few more budget-friendly offerings released over the last year from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523877/aqara-smart-home-review-m2-hub-homekit-alexa-google-assistant"&gt;Aqara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.meross.com/home"&gt;Meross&lt;/a&gt; have made it a little easier on the wallet, but there are still a number of categories entirely missing or sparsely populated — such as robot vacuum cleaners, smart smoke alarms, and home security systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="QZyYA5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Searching for Siri-compatible devices generally means choosing the “highest-priced” filter in the search results&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bvXGH3"&gt;The coming promise of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; may fix this interoperability conundrum, which, to be fair, is not just Apple’s problem. But in the meantime, I’ve found that Siri Shortcuts offers a useful way around some of these limitations. &lt;a href="https://gotailwind.com/"&gt;Tailwind, my favorite garage door controller&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t have HomeKit support for a long time. It does now, but in the interim it offered a Shortcut to program in my own command to have Siri open and close the door. The same deal with my ceiling fans. &lt;a href="https://bondhome.io/product/bond-bridge/"&gt;The Bond Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (an RF device that can communicate with a ceiling fan remote control, not a scene from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/27/22252018/james-bond-no-time-to-die-hmd-global-nokia-phones-product-placement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) can use Siri on your iPhone or Apple Watch to trigger Shortcuts to control my not smart, definitely not HomeKit-compatible fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0QLWz"&gt;The downside of Shortcuts, however, is they only work on an iPhone or Apple Watch, and smart home control needs to be easily accessible to everyone in the house, whether they’ve bought into the Apple ecosystem or not. Until the advent of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the price to outfit a modest-sized home with on-demand Siri access was prohibitive, and even the HomePod Mini’s $99 per room is still steep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GniVqK"&gt;In honor of Siri’s tenth birthday, it looks like the AI is inviting some friends to the party. A new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523045/apple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv"&gt;Siri-enabled accessories program&lt;/a&gt; allows non-Apple gadgets with speakers and microphones in them to relay requests to a HomePod. As of now, the Ecobee SmartThermostat is the only manufacturer to have committed to this. (Considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701965/amazon-fitbit-ecobee-basics-design-halo-view-smart-thermostat-clone-ripoff-regulators"&gt;Amazon just Sherlocked them with its new smart thermostat&lt;/a&gt; I wouldn’t blame Ecobee if it evicted Alexa entirely.) With more ways to talk to Siri in the home and more products that can be controlled by the smart assistant, I’m hoping my swear jar will be gathering cobwebs by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OMrqQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hey Siri, what happened?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/suDspLBgHdfFDtXFwilxVwt4Qxw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947342/acastro_211001_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;After a decade as Apple’s assistant, Siri still hasn’t figured out the job&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XxOI1i"&gt;Ten years ago today, Apple’s digital assistant Siri was revealed with the promise that the iPhone maker had finally figured it all out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQlAfC"&gt;“For decades, technologists have teased us with this dream that you’re going to be able to talk to technology, and it’ll do things for us,” said Apple exec Phil Schiller, taking the stage at the launch of the iPhone 4s. “Haven’t we seen this before, over and over? But it never comes true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cdxm20"&gt;The problem, said Schiller, was that voice interfaces were too reliant on simple syntax. &lt;em&gt;Call&lt;/em&gt; Mom. &lt;em&gt;Dial&lt;/em&gt; 555-2368. &lt;em&gt;Play&lt;/em&gt; Beethoven. “What we really want to do is just talk to our device,” he said, “and your device — in this case, your phone — will figure out what you mean and help you get what you want done.” He paused before bringing up the next slide, showing a familiar icon of a microphone cut-out in burnished aluminum. “That’s a feature on the iPhone 4s we call Siri.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YX13ru"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What we really want to do is just talk to our device,” said Schiller&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lXFa7h"&gt;Described by Schiller as a “humble personal assistant,” Siri gave 2011’s iPhone a dose of star power during a difficult time for Apple. Just months before the phone’s unveiling, a relative unknown at the company, then-chief operating officer Tim Cook, had been named CEO. The day after Schiller’s presentation, Apple’s legendary co-founder Steve Jobs would die from pancreatic cancer. Analysts were cool on the company’s prospects but praised Siri as a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/05/iphone-4s-icloud-analysts"&gt;potential game-changer&lt;/a&gt;. One called it “a powerful harbinger of the future use of mobile devices,” while another said it was “the beginning of a new user experience [for] all of Apple’s mobile and Mac products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="FOHUYM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/agzItTz35QQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R75LfJ"&gt;A decade later, the sheen has worn off Siri’s star. “It is such a letdown,” was how Schiller described the promise of voice interfaces past, and such a description could easily be applied to Apple’s contribution to the genre. Everyone who uses Siri has their own tales of frustration — times when they’ve been surprised not by the intelligence but the stupidity of Apple’s assistant, when it fails to carry out a simple command or mishears a clear instruction. And while voice interfaces have indeed become widespread, Apple, despite being first to market, no longer leads. Its “humble personal assistant” remains humble indeed: inferior to Google Assistant on mobile and outmaneuvered by Amazon’s Alexa in the home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1AzJI"&gt;Looking back on a decade of development for Apple’s personal assistant, there’s one question that seems worth asking: hey Siri, what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vLyruz"&gt;The wow factor&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="khQMdg"&gt;Looking back to 2011, initial reactions to Siri were incredibly positive, with reviewers impressed by the feature’s responsiveness and accuracy. “The crazy thing about Siri is that it works — at least most of the time — better than you’d expect it to,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/10/12/2484524/iphone-4s-review"&gt;was &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s judgment&lt;/a&gt;; “It’s kind of like having the unpaid intern of my dreams at my beck and call,” &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/12/tech/mobile/review-siri-iphone-voice-wired/index.html"&gt;said &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; “Siri saves time, fumbling and distraction, and profoundly changes the definition of ‘phone,’” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/technology/personaltech/iphone-4s-conceals-sheer-magic-pogue.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=technology"&gt;said &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All in all: Apple seemed to be living up to its promises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TLsF1"&gt;But reading these reviews now, it’s clear Siri was graded on a curve. Its novelty and ambition invited generous appraisals, but when reviewers noted frustrations, they caveated that the software was only in beta and that any rough patches would surely be smoothed away in due time. A &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/10/iphone-4s-a-siri-ously-slick-speedy-smartphone/"&gt;detailed run-down of Siri in 2011 from &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlights problems familiar today, with the assistant dinged for mishearing instructions in loud spaces and mangling complex commands. An instruction to “Send a text to Jason, Clint, Sam, and Lee saying we’re having dinner at Silver Cloud” is interpreted with Siri texting Jason: “Clint Sam and Lee saying we’re having dinner at Silver Cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="MYZdcd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Siri was first on the scene, but soon was just part of the chorus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q860Aj"&gt;Siri had a first-mover advantage, but it didn’t take long for rivals to emerge. Samsung introduced S Voice on the Galaxy S3 in 2012; that same year Google Now was launched for Android (replaced by Google Assistant in 2016); in 2014 Microsoft brought out Cortana for Windows Phone; and also that year, Amazon went its own way by introducing customers to Alexa on the Echo smart speaker. Speaking to your computer quickly became an expected feature not just on mobile devices, but a whole range of gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="galXfv"&gt;Looking through reviews and comparisons of digital assistants in this period, two things stick out. The first is that people soon get bored of Siri. As reviewers tackle iPhones after the 4s, they often note incremental updates to the assistant but never dedicate much space to it its features. Partly, this seems just because the changes are so small (e.g., retrieving sports results in iOS 6; integrating Wikipedia in iOS 7; introducing ‘Hey, Siri’ in iOS 8), but also because the novelty has worn off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0N0ZfW"&gt;By the time we get to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/technology/iphone-reviews.html"&gt;reviews of the iPhone 8&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, Siri is mentioned in passing, if at all. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017"&gt;Our own review&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the assistant’s contribution in a single line: “Siri sounds a lot nicer as well, although it’s not any more capable than before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 4S Siri" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e36FE_zxFYAre8sm8lY_SbNQCE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/938847/iPhone_4S_Siri_1020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siri on the iPhone 4s impressed reviewers for its sheer novelty. But Apple never kept up the momentum. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SPA8NE"&gt;The second major trend is that once competitors did arrive, Apple’s advantage evaporated quickly. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/24/3040552/siri-vs-s-voice-comparison-video"&gt;comparison of Siri and Samsung’s S Voice&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 notes that the latter already “offers a very good approximation” of Apple’s digital assistant, while a head-to-head test in 2014 shows that “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/9/6951813/google-now-crushes-siri-and-cortana"&gt;Google Now crushes Siri&lt;/a&gt;.” By 2017, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/19/15655558/google-assistant-vs-siri-iphone-ios-apple-locked-down-sandbox"&gt;noted that&lt;/a&gt; Siri “feels largely half-baked,” and a dissatisfaction with digital assistants in general had begun to creep in. We point out that these assistants can answer basic questions just fine but fail to reliably &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; things for the user — like booking cinema tickets or ordering food. At least, not without creating new problems of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL13Qf"&gt;Looking back, it’s clear that Siri’s big problem is that it failed to maintain momentum. The basic roster of tasks that made Apple’s digital assistant so appealing in 2011 — setting alarms, taking notes, and so on — were never significantly expanded upon. The ability to answer trivia questions and retrieve sport scores is fun, but not as significant an upgrade as telling a computer to complete tasks using just your voice. Meanwhile, rivals replicated and then exceeded what Siri could do. They began to offer more reliable dictation, better language understanding, and integration with third-party skills. Siri just didn’t keep up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lsd4sf"&gt;Trouble at the top&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xLN0Rx"&gt;So, where did things go wrong? How did Apple lose its lead? The answer is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdKpJv"&gt;Many suggest Apple’s dedication to privacy means it can never keep up with rivals like Google whose business involves collecting users’ data because that data is incredibly useful when it comes to improving AI systems. I don’t buy this as a reason for Siri’s failure, though. First, because Apple’s love of user privacy is far from absolute. (In 2019, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that “a small proportion” of Siri recordings were being passed to contractors for analysis, with a whistleblower claiming they overhead discussions “between doctors and patients, business deals, seemingly criminal dealings, sexual encounters and so on.”) And secondly, because Apple is a two-trillion-dollar company. If it wants to circumvent the messy problems of collecting user data, it can, simply by paying to generate this data. Yes, analyzing random Siri interactions is helpful, but there are other ways to achieve the same improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BJ0NiG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When Steve died the day after Siri launched, they lost the vision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wABLGp"&gt;A more convincing explanation is management dysfunction. In 2018, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-seven-year-itch-how-apples-marriage-to-siri-turned-sour"&gt;published a damning report&lt;/a&gt; on the comings-and-goings at team Siri. It noted that there was deep-seated disagreement within the company about how Siri should work (is it a feature focused on search and retrieval, or an assistant that carries out complex tasks?). These disagreements stemmed back to Jobs’ original plans for Siri but had devolved into “petty turf battles and heated arguments” between rival factions. They were exacerbated by a lack of leadership and continuity in the Apple execs overseeing Siri. As one former employee told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;: “When Steve died the day after Siri launched, they lost the vision [...] They didn’t have a big picture.” This tallies with the feature’s stalled development after its initial launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZANm6e"&gt;Other problems are rooted in Apple’s ideology of technology development. For example, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s report claims that Apple exec Richard Williamson made the decision to only update Siri once a year, following the company’s cadence of new hardware and iOS updates. This seems to have slowed progress. (Williamson, who refuted this claim, left Apple in 2012 after spearheading the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/20/3363914/wrong-turn-apple-ios-6-maps-phone-5-buggy-complaints"&gt;disastrous Apple Maps launch&lt;/a&gt;. Scott Forstall, another executive involved in Siri and Apple Maps, &lt;a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/509277/today-in-apple-history-scott-forstall-forced-out-of-apple/"&gt;departed that same year&lt;/a&gt;. Read into that what you will.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJvTNr"&gt;There’s also Apple’s walled garden approach, which means Siri has always worked well with iOS features but played badly with third-party services. While testing Siri in preparation for this story, I was consistently surprised by its failure to execute simple tasks on popular iOS apps. Siri can’t send a voice memo on WhatsApp; can’t post a story to Instagram; can’t record a run on RunKeeper; and can’t open up &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; crossword. Sure, some of the blame for this lack of interoperability lies with outside developers, but it’s also Apple’s job to encourage such functionality through toolkits and the like. The company certainly doesn’t lead by example, either. When I ask Siri for information I know is stored in iOS, like “show me photos from last August,” it just performs an image search for the phrase “last August.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_CDKU4S2TXG2fNJS-ekOGHqWCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22893700/Screen_Shot_2021_10_01_at_4.04.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not close, and no cigar: results when you ask Siri to “show me photos from last August.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WnyGFp"&gt;Instead, Apple uses Siri to herd people back to its own inferior apps like a shepherd directing sheep off a cliff-face. If I ask Siri for directions, it prompts me to reinstall Apple Maps (when I habitually use Google Maps and Citymapper). If I try to send an email to my boss, Siri tells me, “I’m sorry I can’t do that,” and then directs me to the App Store to download Apple’s default mail app (I use Outlook). And, here’s a sign of how slipshod Siri’s development is right now: when this happens, Siri sets up a search for “mobilemail” on the App Store. This, of course, isn’t the name of Apple’s mail app, but an ID used by iOS developers, and so it draws a blank when you search for it on the App Store. That’s the kind of broken functionality you get when a company isn’t thoroughly testing its own product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5L0wtM"&gt;This last point, though, highlights a problem particular not just to Apple’s assistant, but to voice interfaces more generally, and that is one of &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="belhu2"&gt;When Schiller introduced Siri in 2011, he stressed time and time again that Siri would understand users — that it knows what they are saying, just like a real person. This set the bar too high for Siri’s functionality. If you treat voice interfaces as if they have the same level of fluency and knowledge as a human being, you will always be disappointed. We speak, and they stumble. We guess what they’re capable of, and they disappoint. Usually because they don’t support the app or command we thought they would. Each failed interaction then teaches users: &lt;em&gt;don’t trust this feature&lt;/em&gt;. By comparison, screens and displays tell us clearly what we can and cannot do. They offer menus, directions, and buttons. A voice offers only itself and our projections of intelligence. For Siri, users have been guided by Apple’s flair for the theatrical. They expect too much, and Apple delivers too little. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="24pjSv"&gt;The future of voice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ8jBr"&gt;Here’s a true story. I took a break just now from writing this article to make a cup of tea and remembered that I had a meeting in an hour’s time. Worried it might slip my mind, I did what I often do in these situations: I asked Siri to set a reminder. “Siri, remind me at ten to five that I have a call,” I said. “Okay,” said Siri, “Setting a reminder for tomorrow at five: you have a call.” I tried again. This time Siri created a reminder for ten o’clock in the evening. The third time, I paused mid-command, trying to think of a clearer way to word my query. Siri got tired of waiting and beeped at me: “What do you want me to remind you of?” And at that, I gave up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xfCE77"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple can’t afford to give up on Siri&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l1xMve"&gt;It’s true that Siri and its ilk are often disappointing, but they still tempt users because they hold great potential. Despite the problems associated with voice interfaces, the technology represents a genuine advance. I regularly use Siri for quick tasks, like taking notes, setting timers, and making searches. And when it works, it works seamlessly and unthinkingly. It’s a genuine time-saver. Siri can do much more, too, especially if you’re willing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22704860/siri-best-smart-home-voice-assistant-editorial"&gt;dive into the world of Apple Shortcuts and smart home commands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWPvuM"&gt;As an accessibility tool, voice controls and dictation have opened up modern gadgets to many more users, and since Apple introduced Siri in 2011, the company has launched a number of products that rely heavily on voice. This is either because screen real estate is limited (the Apple Watch) or it’s nonexistent (the AirPods and HomePod). In years to come, we can expect Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;augmented reality glasses&lt;/a&gt; to be added to this list. With this in mind, Apple urgently needs to fix Siri — not ignore it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7tmRQiWXwOhvqxy7gSrUc-vv5eI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15993026/akrales_190327_3315_0182.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirPods, HomePod, and Apple Watch — all products where Siri is helpful or essential. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lSIjso"&gt;If you want to be optimistic, then there are some signs the company is turning the ship around. AI, in general, has received much more attention from Apple in recent years. From poaching Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17195076/google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-joining-apple-machine-learning-siri"&gt;head of machine learning in 2018&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/13/16300464/apple-iphone-x-ai-neural-engine"&gt;designing its own AI processors&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21301511/apple-ai-machine-learning-features-wwdc-2020-convenience"&gt;regular launch of AI-enhanced features&lt;/a&gt;, the company is clearly paying more attention to the field. And, best of all, Siri itself has seen a few significant improvements, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522993/apple-siri-on-device-speech-recognition-no-internet-wwdc"&gt;on-device processing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523045/apple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv"&gt;availability on third-party hardware&lt;/a&gt; added this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Di1z2J"&gt;I’m still skeptical, though. For a start, even when it comes to basic commands, it often seems Siri is not just standing still but moving backward. With iOS 15, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/352142/ios-15-siri-third-party-app-integrations-deprecated.html"&gt;removed a decent chunk of Siri’s functionality&lt;/a&gt;, including tasks related to notes and photos, and third-party integrations like ride-hailing and payments. Other basic commands, like checking voicemail, also seem &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/users-complain-about-siri-no-longer-being-able-to-send-email-and-check-call-history/"&gt;to have recently disappeared&lt;/a&gt; (whether temporarily or not isn’t clear). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdqcXC"&gt;The big problem, I think, is that Apple still doesn’t know what it wants Siri to be. Is the feature simply a way to control your phone with your voice — letting you navigate apps and find content? Or is it something more ambitious — an actual assistant capable of carrying out complex tasks on your behalf? Apple tends to present Siri as the latter in marketing materials, while users find its functionality limited to the former. As someone who reports on AI and machine learning, I think we’re still many, many years away from building computers that truly &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; us. Language is just too complex, too deeply rooted in human experience and culture, to be brute-forced by the sort of statistical models we’re throwing at the problem. And while, yes, there are lots of impressive new language systems out there, none of them are reliable enough to create a flawless digital assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="D5vLZ1"&gt;If Apple wants to salvage Siri, I think it needs to reset expectations and focus on core competencies instead. It’s interesting to compare Siri’s launch with that of its competitors. When Google introduced &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/snL88L1DQQ4"&gt;Google Assistant in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the focus was less on solving complex tasks and understanding users’ every whim, and more on making the company’s basic search functionality accessible in more places. It was a tighter focus that gave Google the space to surprise, rather than disappoint. (Though the company has certainly over-promised in later ads, too.) Siri, by comparison, surprised us all when it launched in 2011, but has since burned out that goodwill. Apple needs to re-focus on the basics rather than push into a future that doesn’t yet exist. It needs to start listening.&lt;/p&gt;
