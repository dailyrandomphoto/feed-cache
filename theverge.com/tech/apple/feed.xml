    <title>Flappy Bird clone hacked into playable macOS push notification</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07-hKgcJXAJlQCnfNrD3PxsoCD0=/151x0:2310x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112203/msedge_L9EISOzg3c.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video shows the game playable in a push notification.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Twitter / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Sardesai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJnCPF"&gt;In a new video, a developer has shown off a playable version of viral hit &lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt; running inside a macOS push notification. It’s the work of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913"&gt;Neil Sardesai&lt;/a&gt;, who previously &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/mac-pong-on-a-dock-icon-is-cute-as-hell"&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt; with a clip of &lt;em&gt;Pong&lt;/em&gt; running inside a macOS app icon. The hack has yet to receive a public release, but it’s still a neat proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIC5Ez"&gt;According to Sardesai, the feature works by loading a web version of the game &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380942741224484871"&gt;into the notification&lt;/a&gt;. This playable version is technically a browser-based clone of the original app &lt;a href="https://playcanv.as/p/2OlkUaxF/"&gt;made by Will Eastcott of PlayCanvas&lt;/a&gt;. Sardesai notes that the feature relies on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649830175932421"&gt;UserNotificationsUI framework&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by Apple with macOS Big Sur, though he says it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1381008674060177418"&gt;should also work on iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="enCvwY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did you know you can put a whole game inside of a push notification &lt;a href="https://t.co/LlMx2AjvHH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LlMx2AjvHH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Neil Sardesai (@neilsardesai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RoN6H7"&gt;Distracting notifications are bad enough when you’re trying to get some work done, but combining them with a playable version of an infamously addictive game is the final straw. Sardesai doesn’t appear to have released his work publicly for anyone to try out, which is probably a good thing for the sake of our sanity. After all, the last thing humanity needs right now is for our devices to be able to compel us to play several rounds of &lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt; with just a simple notification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxYSuF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt;’s addictive nature was cited by its developer as one of the reasons he removed it from the App Store after it became a hit in 2014. “It happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem,” Dong Nguyen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5400488/flappy-bird-pulled-because-it-became-addictive"&gt;said in an interview at the time&lt;/a&gt;. Although the original game is gone from the App Store, numerous clones have surfaced in its wake, including an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761627/flappy-royale-bird-fortnite-battle-mobile-gaming-developers"&gt;excellent battle royale version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly developing an Apple TV with a built-in camera and speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rm0pc9afyC78oZ3WRjASjHfdkLQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111969/akrales_170919_1976_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QnHWwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly developing a new TV accessory that combines elements of its Apple TV with a HomePod speaker and camera for video calls, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Apple is also said to be working on a smart speaker with a display, similar to Amazon’s Echo Show or Google’s Nest Hub. Development of both devices is said to be in its early stages, with plans subject to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekAI8e"&gt;The unannounced TV accessory would have the hardware to fulfill a variety of roles. As a TV accessory it could offer access to games and the streaming video services supported by Apple TV today; while its built-in speaker would likely be an upgrade over those found in most TV sets, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459521/roku-streambar-soundbar-compact-streaming-bluetooth-spotify-connect-tv-audio"&gt;Roku’s soundbars&lt;/a&gt;. It would also support HomePod features like music playback and Siri voice assistant controls, much like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637225/sonos-google-assistant-how-to-set-up-one-beam-home"&gt;Sonos Beam offers&lt;/a&gt; with Alexa and Google Assistant. Finally, the camera would let it serve as a video calling device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871173/facebook-portal-camera-price-release-date-availability"&gt;like a Facebook Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt; TV&lt;/a&gt;. It’s potentially a lot of functionality in a single Apple device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AbEOj6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A HomePod, Apple TV, and video conferencing device in one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JFsFd"&gt;The second device is a smart display similar to what competitors Amazon and Google already offer, combining features of an iPad and HomePod. Apple’s work on the device was previously &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats?sref=ExbtjcSG#lazy-img-370126915:~:text=It%20has%20also%20been%20developing%20new,such%20a%20launch%20isn%E2%80%99t%20imminent.%20Apple"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. Like the TV accessory, this device would also offer video chat features, but via its built-in screen rather than a connected TV. Apple is said to have explored using a robotic arm to rotate the display and track users, similar to Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454117/amazon-new-echo-show-10-alexa-smart-display-moving-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;2020 Echo Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0wj9z"&gt;While Apple’s existing smart home devices have focused on one or two key areas, the functionality offered by the two rumored devices would be much broader. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Apple merged its HomePod and Apple TV engineering groups in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BZsva"&gt;Apple’s smart home lineup could use a shot in the arm. The company hasn’t updated its Apple TV hardware lineup since 2017, and it recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;discontinued its high-end HomePod&lt;/a&gt; to focus on the more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt;. A hardware update for the Apple TV has been rumored &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;for several months now&lt;/a&gt;, and recently discovered code suggests it might include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;support for 120Hz refresh rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New iPad Pro still coming soon but supply could be short, says Bloomberg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NF4oZcxXgcM7MUhtj_s9N6d3a-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111526/akrales_181101_3064_0078.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3xqWDa"&gt;Apple’s next iPad Pro may face supply constraints at launch due to issues in production, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s suppliers are said to be having trouble with low manufacturing yields for the new Mini LED display rumored to be the key feature of the new 12.9-inch model; one manufacturer has reportedly paused production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Ae6O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373281/chip-shortage-apple-macbook-ipad-delay-nikkei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that iPad production had been delayed by a shortage of displays and display components, though the publication didn’t specify which models had been hit. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1381456421607202820"&gt;According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, the new iPad Pro lineup is still expected to be announced later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk6vNj"&gt;It’s possible, though, that the larger model may have a later shipping date. The smaller model reportedly won’t use the Mini LED display, but other upgrades across the line are said to include a faster processor similar in power to the M1 chip in Apple’s new Macs, as well as an upgraded USB-C port and better cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it will send a witness to Senate hearing on app stores after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxvfy5MYV2A2o2l-kYDwt8pylbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69109994/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjupRR"&gt;After several senators criticized the company, Apple said on Sunday it would send its chief compliance officer to an April 21st hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the office of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday demanding that the company send a representative to the hearing, saying Apple was refusing to participate. &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter&lt;/a&gt;, Klobuchar and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) say Apple “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for the hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,” the senators wrote in the letter. “We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWqPC"&gt;But on Sunday, Apple sent a letter to the senators saying it was “surprised” by their letter and that it had intended to participate, but simply sought a change in the date. “We have a deep respect for your role and process on these matters,” the letter reads, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-11/apple-makes-top-executive-available-at-senate-app-store-hearing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company will make Kyle Andeer— who Apple says has represented the company before the US House of Representatives and several states—available on April 21st. “We look forward to sharing our perspective on our App Store,” the letter states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCfE13"&gt;Lee said in a joint statement with Klobuchar emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Sunday that he was glad Apple had “changed course and agreed to testify before the committee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3umhb"&gt;Klobuchar said in the statement the hearing will explore “whether Apple and Google are using their power as gatekeepers to charge high fees and impose restrictions that suppress competition in mobile applications and related markets, and both companies‘ participation in the hearing is necessary.” She added that the companies “have the power to control how and if mobile app developers can reach app users, and ultimately, which apps become successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSug3"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday. Its App Store practices, including the 30 percent fees it charges developers, have been under scrutiny from lawmakers in recent months. Apple also has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;battling with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; publisher Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, which sued the iPhone maker for what it claims are violations of antitrust law. That trial is slated to get underway May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvbzcQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UDXOY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 11th 5:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds statement from Sens. Klobuchar and Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5010ks"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is shutting down its mobile Shopping app</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkIEdBIgzWa_DEbdPRNDiZy3N68=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69109239/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0kWpia"&gt;Google is shutting down its mobile Shopping apps for both iOS and Android and directing users to its web Shopping site instead, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/google-shopping-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported. On Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-shopping-app-being-killed-off/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xda Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the term “sunset” had been added to several strings of code in the Shopping app, suggesting the apps were being discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxSVpZ"&gt;A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt; that the apps will continue to function through June. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Within the next few weeks, we’ll no longer be supporting the Shopping app. All of the functionality the app offered users is available on the Shopping tab,” the spokesperson said. We’ll continue building features within the Shopping tab and other Google surfaces, including the Google app.” The &lt;a href="http://shopping.google.com"&gt;shopping.google.com&lt;/a&gt; site will remain active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2C0bS3"&gt;The app allowed users to choose from among thousands of online stores and make purchases using their Google accounts. to quickly shop across thousands of stores and purchase stuff using your Google Account. This user found the Android app to be working normally on Sunday, but some users were already seeing a “something went wrong” message when they tried to use the Shopping app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3lA23j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;RIP Google Shopping's mobile app. Google is preparing to sunset it.

    <title>Epic antitrust case versus Apple in Australia gets three-month stay </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGTM665yR__G3wga7bj27k3Pf-Y=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106057/apple_fortnite_1984_parody.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qF227E"&gt;An Australian judge has ruled that Epic’s lawsuit against Apple in Australia will be temporarily suspended as the two sides prepare for a trial in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/04/epic-vs-apple-australia-court-case-temporarily-suspended/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo Australia&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/03/apple-tried-to-kill-epics-australian-fortnite-lawsuit-this-week/"&gt;asked for a permanent stay&lt;/a&gt; of the case in Australia, arguing that the US and Australia cases were very similar, and that the matter should be settled in the original jurisdiction of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umZUrn"&gt;The two companies are fighting over Epic’s battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite, &lt;/em&gt;and the fees Apple charges&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; In August, Epic set up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;own in-game payments system,&lt;/a&gt; effectively circumventing Apple’s App Store payments and avoiding the 30 percent surcharge Apple collects on App Store purchases. Apple then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from its iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; for violating its rules. Epic fired back with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;antitrust lawsuit seeking to establish Apple’s App Store as a monopoly&lt;/a&gt; and tried to rally &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367924/watch-epic-nineteen-eighty-fortnite-short-apple-app-store-ban"&gt;protest video&lt;/a&gt; mocking Apple’s iconic “1984” ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6PyAm"&gt;In November, Epic filed a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-legal-proceedings-against-google-in-australia"&gt;similar legal claim&lt;/a&gt; against Apple in Australia, saying the iPhone maker’s conduct was “unconscionable, and breaches the Australian Consumer Law as well as various sections of the Competition and Consumer Act [of] 2010.” Epic has also filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323100/epic-google-australia-legal-claim-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;similar claims against Google&lt;/a&gt; and its mobile app store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLQHTl"&gt;Australian Judge Nye Perram ordered Friday that the case in that country be temporarily stayed for three months. He also said the proceedings will continue to be suspended in Australia if Epic continues to pursue its case in the US, but could bring the case back to Australian courts depending on the outcome in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clF5lN"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Apple and Epic filed proposed findings of fact documents&lt;/a&gt; for the US court case, which is set to open in California on May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnLt5y"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Saturday, an Epic spokesperson said the company “remained committed to our fight for increased competition on digital platforms in Australia and around the world,” adding that the company planned to “continue supporting the Australian government and regulators in their pursuit of fair competition in mobile app marketplaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Pnu3O"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SXbDJy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite vs. Apple and Google: everything you need to know about Epic’s mobile app stores fight","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="whZUWB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV4Ypo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: April 10th, 2:22PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Epic spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple refuses request to testify for Senate app store hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4ilqchlztE6YxiGVW2_jo2uWy8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103463/acastro_190322_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee leaders are demanding that Apple provide a witness for an upcoming hearing on app stores and digital competition after the iPhone manufacturer has refused to participate, according to a new letter to the company released Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imbRdT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter addressed&lt;/a&gt; to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) say the company “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for an April hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RT3z2o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8h7rdt"&gt;“Apple has been aware for weeks that the Subcommittee was planning a hearing on this topic and was engaged in discussions with our staff regarding who would testify on Apple’s behalf,” the senators wrote to Apple Friday. “Yet a little more than two weeks [16 days] before the planned hearing, Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness to testify at a hearing in April.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhNpZ6"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSug3"&gt;Apple’s App Store practices have been under intense scrutiny by lawmakers over the last year. In 2019, the House Judiciary Committee launched an investigation into competition in the tech industry, including Apple’s App Store. Throughout the probe, lawmakers homed in on the 30 percent fees Apple charges app developers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;interview last June&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman David Cicilline (D-RI) called the practice “highway robbery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvbzcQ"&gt;The criticism extends to the app developers themselves. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;publisher Epic Games sued Apple last year, accusing the company of violating US antitrust laws after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;removed the popular battle royale&lt;/a&gt; game from the App Store. The trial is set to begin on May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,” the senators wrote. “We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elx5N3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s big podcasting move is creating shows to promote TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WpownqYEXeHyOwgMrsJ06wAczEQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103100/VRG_ILLO_4520_Apple_Podcast_TV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mEJw9o"&gt;The podcasting world’s been waiting and watching for Apple to debut a full-blown revenue-producing podcast business. Spotify and other tech giants have been making moves in the space — signing exclusivity deals, acquiring companies, and generally trying to dominate the market. Yet, Apple has stayed mostly quiet, despite operating one of, if not the most, popular podcast apps on the market. Recently, however, it’s started to dabble in creating its own shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbGlxd"&gt;This week, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Foriginals%2Fthe-line%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F9%2F22375738%2Fapple-podcast-the-line-us-navy-spotify-original-shows" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;premiered&lt;/a&gt; a new investigative nonfiction podcast looking at US Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was charged with committing war crimes. The show, called &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;, serves as a complementary but separately reported program to a forthcoming Apple TV Plus show of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfOM7u"&gt;Anyone hoping this might signal Apple’s broader interest in building its own podcast content was likely disappointed. Although &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt; represents a step toward Apple creating its own shows, it doesn’t dive the company head-first into the podcasting waters. Instead, the company’s dipping its toes in, relying on podcasts to promote its subscription programming rather than using podcasts as a moneymaker themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2eQLJX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s original podcast endeavors serve as marketing for its other revenue-making businesses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqP0xb"&gt;Apple’s strategy continues to grow around these companion shows. Earlier this year, it premiered &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast to complement its TV show of the same name, and it created a companion show for the Oprah Book Club in partnership with Apple Books. It also plans to launch a show in coordination with the premiere of &lt;em&gt;The Problem With Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, another Apple TV Plus series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371914/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall"&gt;coming this fall&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of a full-throated proclamation that Apple wants to build a business around podcasting, we’re instead seeing Apple use audio to push podcast listeners toward its moneymaking subscription service TV Plus, as well as its a la carte book-selling app Books. Basically, Apple is playing it safe and avoiding a full commitment to podcasting, which, as of right now, doesn’t make it money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKbtwx"&gt;These companion podcasts instead serve as a marketing tool to capture potential audiences in new places. Maybe some dedicated podcast listeners missed Apple’s promotional push for &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;, but instead spotted the program in a show carousel on the main Apple Podcasts page. If they listen, they then might want to subscribe to TV Plus for &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;’s streaming premiere, and Apple gains a $4.99-per-month subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrZOfX"&gt;This doesn’t mean Apple won’t eventually build a way to make money off podcasting. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-podcasting-subscription-service-in-threat-to-spotify"&gt;been rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be getting into the podcast game more deeply and is reportedly working on a paid podcast feature. Currently, however, Apple doesn’t support any sort of revenue-producing functionality in its podcast app, like tipping, subscriptions, or exclusive content gating. For comparison, Spotify, Apple’s biggest player competitor, is testing subscription Anchor podcasts and offers a premium subscription tier. It also sells ads against its own podcasts and inserts additional ads into free users’ streams, giving the company a number of ways to profit off shows. Apple will likely never look to advertising as its main revenue driver for podcasting. The company’s taken a firm stance on user privacy, and targeting podcast ads would cross that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HeyMBX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting podcast listeners to subscribe to TV Plus could give Apple a user boost&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEJDGm"&gt;It could, however, start charging for podcast content or, instead of launching a podcast in coordination with an already created TV Plus show, use its original podcasts as a launching pad for future series. If a show does well as a podcast, Apple itself could greenlight the idea into a TV production, further driving revenue. This is already a podcasting business strategy. Shows like &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; started out as successful podcasts that were then turned into video programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFakrn"&gt;Other video streaming companies have pulled from a similar podcasting playbook. &lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/podcasts"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://netflixeditorial.com/channels/netflix-podcasts/"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; both create companion content for their shows, which not only encourages viewers to spend more time with the company’s programming, but also reaches a different audience, one that might be enticed to subscribe just because of what they heard on a podcast. The difference between those companies and Apple is their lack of podcasting infrastructure. They don’t have a player themselves, so there’s less opportunity to build a business around original shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rExaAP"&gt;Apple has multiple one-ups on these other streaming services. It already owns the space where a large portion of people listen to podcasts, and it offers a variety of content subscriptions for games, TV shows, fitness, and more, including a bundle. Building the technology to support paid podcasts is one of the last steps to structure the business — it’s that and believing podcasting could actually become a real revenue driver all on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung tries to woo iPhone users with a browser-based Galaxy test drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-tL5rT3tnAniP5hRb7OXfcVVG8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100721/DSCF0384_result.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s iTest site on an iPhone 12 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y70C9m"&gt;Samsung has released &lt;a href="https://www.itest.nz/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; to give iPhone users “a little taste of Samsung” from their mobile browser. When visited on an iPhone, the site prompts users to add it to their phone’s home screen, after which it turns into a shortcut to a simulated Samsung Galaxy device. The site appears to be the work of Samsung New Zealand, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/samsung-itest-galaxy-device-iphone-experience/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqyLej"&gt;The experience might be limited, but it’s a neatly designed bit of marketing. Open up the camera “app” and a video will automatically play featuring influencer Logan Dodds, who describes Samsung’s camera app features in the interface around him. Poke around the other “apps” in the home screen and Samsung happily markets its phone’s other features and accessories, while text messages and even a fake phone call outline others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8yqhwHjJNLmEPaYlw_596woOS5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431983/IMG_0574.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tooltip from the settings app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SoB9n6iGmuve8gHxjCxLgYflnkg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431982/IMG_0573.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are fake contacts in the message app to text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nCrW3d"&gt;There are also a couple of Easter eggs thrown in if you dig a little deeper. I particularly liked finding the “Friends with kids” contact in the text message app, who sends you garbled nonsense whenever you send them a message. Pry too much into the settings app and you’ll be shown a tooltip that reads, “We’ve simplified the settings menu experience, just so our developer could have a lunch break.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jgXzj"&gt;Samsung is targeting the experience squarely at iPhone users. Try to visit the site with another Android phone and you get a message that says, “You’re on Android already,” while if you try to visit using a desktop browser the site gives you a QR code to scan with your iPhone. Yes, it’s ultimately just a bit of marketing, but it’s more creative than most other smartphone ads out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRwl3z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U12vbn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says iMessage on Android ‘will hurt us more than help us’  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF0be5uHxP1MU1ILYSxxsJAbT9Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69099875/akrales_190513_3338_0008_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBZmZy"&gt;Apple knows that iMessage’s blue bubbles are a big barrier to people switching to Android, which is why the service has never appeared on Google’s mobile operating system. That’s according to depositions and emails from Apple employees, including some high-ranking executives, revealed in &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf"&gt;a court filing&lt;/a&gt; from Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;as part of its legal dispute&lt;/a&gt; with the iPhone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVNGvI"&gt;Epic argues that Apple consciously tries to lock customers into its ecosystem of devices, and that iMessage is one of the key services helping it to do so. It cites comments made by Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller to support its argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oKuZvO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Three questions that will decide Epic v. Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="32yjX7"&gt;“The #1 most difficult [reason] to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage ... iMessage amounts to serious lock-in,” was how one unnamed former Apple employee put it in an email in 2016, prompting Schiller to respond that, “moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tLvPQo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AWdybq"&gt;“iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” was Federighi’s concern according to the Epic filing. Although workarounds to using iMessage on Android have emerged over the years, none have been particularly convenient or reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pj5gKJ"&gt;According to Epic’s filing, citing Eddy Cue, Apple decided not to develop iMessage for Android as early as 2013, following the launch of the messaging service with iOS 5 in 2011. Cue admits that Apple “could have made a version on Android that worked with iOS” so that “users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly.” Evidently, such a version was never developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwsUJV"&gt;Along with iMessage, Epic cites a series of other Apple services that it argues contribute to lock-in. Notably, these include its video chat service FaceTime, which Steve Jobs announced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOxf9tEXEKQ"&gt;would be an open industry standard&lt;/a&gt; back at WWDC 2010. FaceTime subsequently released across iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but it’s not officially available for any non-Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS2O37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q968OH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
