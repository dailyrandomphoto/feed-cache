    <title>Apple just fired a leader of the #AppleToo movement</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmn5zY"&gt;Apple has fired Janneke Parrish, a leader of the #AppleToo movement, amid a broad crackdown on leaks and worker organizing. Parrish, a program manager on Apple Maps, was terminated for deleting files off of her work devices during an internal investigation — an action Apple categorized as “non-compliance,” according to people familiar with the situation. The files included apps like Robinhood, Pokémon GO, and Google Drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZWZrT"&gt;Internally, some employees expressed disbelief that Parrish’s firing could be anything other than retaliation for organizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DJxKT"&gt;It’s the second time in recent months that an employee has been terminated after speaking out about Apple’s company culture. In September, the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22666049/apple-fires-senior-engineering-program-manager-ashley-gjovik-for-allegedly-leaking-information"&gt;fired Ashley Gjøvik &lt;/a&gt;for allegedly leaking confidential information. Gjøvik has filed multiple charges with the NLRB related to how Apple treated her and the broader workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoDODk"&gt;Gjøvik’s latest charge alleges that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-ceo-s-anti-leak-edict-broke-the-law-ex-employee-alleges?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Tim Cook’s anti-leaking memo might violate US labor law&lt;/a&gt;. In September, the CEO sent a note to all Apple employees saying that “people who leak confidential information do not belong” at Apple. He also said the company was doing “everything in our power to identify those who leaked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66nB9c"&gt;The comments were related to an all-hands meeting on September 17th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;which leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qg3J4K"&gt;Apple’s recent actions seem designed to chill worker organizing. In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;employees launched the #AppleToo website&lt;/a&gt; to allow workers across the company — including AppleCare and retail — to submit stories about workplace harassment and discrimination. Parrish and Cher Scarlett, an Apple software engineer, then began &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@UrsulaRa"&gt;sharing these stories on Medium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7nECa"&gt;Parrish declined to comment for this story. Her attorney, Vincent P. White of White, Hilferty and Albanese, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt; “We can confirm she is no longer with Apple but cannot speak further to address the situation at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YacI3p"&gt;Scarlett is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/14/apple-worker-cher-scarlett/"&gt;currently on paid medical leave&lt;/a&gt; due to internal harassment she’s received while advocating for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;remote work&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;pay transparency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6l1JD"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 15’s new Focus modes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dpkQp-pUcc5TNGEA14QrcPezeJA=/0x0:700x467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999461/ios15_iphone12_pro_settings_focus_crop__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUGjjn"&gt;These days, it is way too easy to be pulled from your work by notifications and other distractions. In order to help you keep your attention where you want it, Apple has added new Focus features to iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1bBad"&gt;The idea is to keep you “in the moment” by filtering out apps or notifications that you don’t want popping up during specific times. The nice thing is that you can create different profiles to keep you from being disturbed, depending on whether you’re at home, at work, getting ready for bed, driving, or for any other activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h134kI"&gt;When you first start to set Focus up, it can seem a little daunting. There are a lot of choices, and a lot of ways you can tweak it. In fact, it may take a while before you get the combination of settings that works best for your lifestyle. But in the end, it will be worth it — it will mean that you won’t be sidelined during times you need to concentrate, and you won’t be bothered by irrelevant notifications when you’ve got other activities in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll find your new Focus button in the Control Center." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqKUrOXcxaTA1c1p2DPG0B19mCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929129/IMG_2E41D6D8A9B5_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll find your new Focus button in the Control Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on Focus, and you’ll see all your various profiles." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rl5IDdE5v4QvQ4Ma02QaTzhVCBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929128/IMG_C5F6B766D9B7_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on Focus, and you’ll see all your various profiles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ho2e9P"&gt;Begin to focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eF8B9R"&gt;You access Focus mode via your Control Center (swipe down from the upper right corner). You’ll see the Focus button with a moon icon next to it. If you tap the icon, then the main Do Not Disturb profile will be active. If you tap anywhere else in the button, you’ll see a selection of other profiles that you can activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQRtvY"&gt;Tap on the three dots to the right of each button, and you can set the length of time you want that Focus profile to be active. Or you can tap the Settings button to tweak the settings for that Focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWvVZu"&gt;But perhaps the best way to start is to go to Settings &amp;gt; Focus, where you can set up all the various Focus profiles you are planning to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V15dui"&gt;Set up your profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2FOIon"&gt;When you first open the Focus page in your settings, you’ll see a list of several profiles, starting with the basic Do Not Disturb and then going on to Personal, Sleep, and Work. If you tap on the plus sign in the upper right corner of the screen, you’ll find the others, including Driving, Fitness, Gaming, Mindfulness, and Readings. If none of those suit, you  can create a custom profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnxcpV"&gt;In addition, there is a toggle that lets you can share the profiles across your various Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzsXlc"&gt;We’ll look at some of the profiles in a moment, but let’s start by tapping on Do Not Disturb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The main Focus page lets you set up a variety of profiles." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hqdOC1YwPCOLESS0988eW6n5CQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929013/IMG_42A19892FE43_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main Focus page lets you set up a variety of profiles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The initial Do Not Disturb profile offers a basic template." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPj2xJKtdw0Ss8ckp20CEX2-DS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929035/IMG_917D02D42034_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The initial Do Not Disturb profile offers a basic template.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FIYrZd"&gt;Do Not Disturb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="21ARpr"&gt;The first thing you’ll see on top of the Do Not Disturb page (and, in fact, on top of all the profile pages) is the toggle to turn the mode on and off. After that, there are a variety of filters that you can tweak to determine when and how Focus will be set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="l6AgJT"&gt;Allowed notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JafgFu"&gt;Focus lets you specify people or apps that can continue to notify you even if you have Do Not Disturb active. For example, you may want to allow calls to come in from family members, or notifications from your work Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FV9dc"&gt;To make these exceptions, tap on the People or Apps box to get to the Allowed Notifications page. (It doesn’t really matter which you tap; you’ll end up on the same page.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can allow specific apps to continuing notifying you during Focus times." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEQxI-DYvD0_AMxW9F-grctJC9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929036/IMG_12BD6DF55162_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can allow specific apps to continuing notifying you during Focus times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on the plus sign and you get a list of apps to choose from." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49kc4VfarFcKI73BMb04EpaMdpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929037/IMG_698503BFB14C_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on the plus sign and you get a list of apps to choose from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id="GkJBIZ"&gt;Allowed apps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="zPsxL8"&gt;If you’re choosing one or more apps, then tap the App tab and then the plus button. You’ll get a list of your installed apps; check off those you want to add to the Allowed Notifications list, and select Done at the top right of the page. You’ll now see your chosen apps listed under Allowed Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poPpBl"&gt;If you change your mind for any of your apps, you can just tap the minus sign next to each icon or select the “Remove All” link on the upper right of the Allowed Apps section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHtNdN"&gt;You can also allow Time Sensitive notifications to come through by toggling it on. Time  Sensitive notifications are from apps you’ve individually tagged as important enough to break through any filter, no matter what. To select which apps are that important to you, you have to leave Focus and go to Settings &amp;gt; Notifications; select the app or apps you want to qualify — say, Calendar — and make sure Time Sensitive notifications is toggled on for that app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also select which people can still contact you." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p2aIH9ToanE_9iOj1t68um-wDGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929042/IMG_092F5ED1AB24_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also select which people can still contact you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap “Calls From” to choose general categories of contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUhzR5d2dv_4o12ZaWz4KYlDboA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929044/IMG_4EC82D8508B0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap “Calls From” to choose general categories of contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id="4o02dF"&gt;Allowed people&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="tjHRzU"&gt;The way you allow notifications from specific people to break through the set Focus mode is pretty much the same as with the apps: select the plus sign under the People tab to add from your list of contacts. You can also allow incoming calls from various categories of people: either everyone who calls, no one (if you really want not to be disturbed), people who are tagged as favorites, or anyone in your contact list. You can also allow through any calls that are repeated within three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ym6FGI"&gt;Other options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pXCwk4"&gt;There are also a variety of other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2WPEQX"&gt;You can choose to share your focus status — so if somebody texts you, they will get a display saying that you have notifications silenced. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JvSCV9"&gt;You can hide notifications from your homescreen pages or your lock screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AdypEo"&gt;You can have only specific homescreens be active during certain times of the day — for example, you can put all your gaming apps on one homescreen, and keep that screen hidden when you’re at work. To do that, tap on the Home Screen button in your profile, toggle on Custom Pages, and then choose which page or pages you want to be available when that profile is active. (Pro tip: to hide those custom extra homescreens when you’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in a Focus mode, long-press on your homescreen to put it in editing mode, then tap the dots at the bottom. Uncheck the screens you don’t want to show.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="From the profile’s main screen, select Home Screen and then toggle on Custom Pages." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fySmiX4tfuvb0YJwuvuZKwWO_pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929209/IMG_09CF86ED709C_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the profile’s main screen, select Home Screen and then toggle on Custom Pages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhqUZnABBt0X2pxhJli2CyvfUaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929210/IMG_F356B3B5F40F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can then choose which screens you want available when the profile is active.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="I9svS1"&gt;You can arrange to have the focus mode turn on automatically during specific times and on specific days — for example, from 9AM to 5PM on weekdays. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oSnWz5"&gt;You can even — and this is really nice — arrange to have it activate when you are at specific locations or when you’re using specific apps by selecting “Add Schedule or Automation” at the bottom of the mode settings page. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Add Schedule or Automation” brings you to a page where you can arrange for Focus to automatically start." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5GTcZYkDbTsvm80u2zz9vXOJclk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929026/IMG_675B90AF3D63_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Add Schedule or Automation” brings you to a page where you can arrange for Focus to automatically start.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="For example, you can have a Focus profile automatically start when you are at a specific location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bAnKcuSxlDLTKLXlH-KxtGKC63E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929028/IMG_F33D365A26CE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For example, you can have a Focus profile automatically start when you are at a specific location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XBnb8F"&gt;That brings you to the New Automation page where, for example, you can have it activate whenever you’re at work, or when you’re watching a Netflix video. And if this is something that happens often — for example, when you go to work or read in the evenings — activate Smart Activation, which will (hopefully) learn your habits and turn on Do Not Disturb when you need it. (If it gets things wrong, you can always turn it off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q0BLRx"&gt;Focus profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OOCtg7"&gt;In order to use the profiles, you need to set them up to fit your needs. I listed the ones available at the beginning of this article; in order to get used to them, let’s try setting up two: Personal and Driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOHqUO"&gt;When you tap on a profile that has not yet been set up, you are presented with a set of screens that walk you through the initial processing, including which people and apps should be allowed to notify you when the Focus is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The preset Focus profiles use wizards to help you start using them." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DItlkXxSgopkn8OgxDK1vmqmqeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929022/IMG_D59C1674EB50_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The preset Focus profiles use wizards to help you start using them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After the initial setup, you can continue to filter each profile." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5xPrDVIP-F7vLzxVVPf5ZJPEbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929023/IMG_CB5C5AB66007_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After the initial setup, you can continue to filter each profile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7R325M"&gt;After that, you are dropped into the Focus page for that profile, which will be similar to the Do Not Disturb setup described above. In Personal, you can not only tweak the allowed notifications but decide whether you want to share your Focus status, hide the notifications on your homescreen or lock screen, or create an automation that will turn it on and off at a certain time, in a certain place, or with a certain app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlrFO6"&gt;Some of the other presets are more specific. For example, when I created a Focus for driving, the opening page of the wizard told me that it was silencing alerts and notifications while I was driving; that it would turn on automatically when I was driving; and that it would arrange auto-reply to let people know why I wasn’t responding to notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Profiles such as “Driving” offer specialized filters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RE2ZL_O7aPofaUdH2GCZjeiYxXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929018/IMG_06093F59A446_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles such as “Driving” offer specialized filters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can decide what will cause the profile to automatically start." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/acMGfIxQ6X6xhTu0OLaQ0DduTn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929020/IMG_0ABB49FDE07B_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can decide what will cause the profile to automatically start.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="svlOjw"&gt;And the Driving Focus page had a few differences as well. Allowed notifications include people but not apps (under the assumption that you’re not playing with apps while you’re at the wheel). There is an auto-reply option that lets you edit the message that will be sent to people who try to contact you while the Focus is on. And you can choose how the app will know you’re driving: automatically (based on detected motion), if the CarPlay app is activated, if the phone is connected to a car’s Bluetooth, or when you turn it on manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nyeg1"&gt;If none of the presets work for you, you can create a custom profile by tapping on the plus sign in the upper right corner of the main Focus screen and choosing Custom. You will be asked to name your new profile and to choose a color and icon to represent it.  After that, the process is pretty much the same as for Personal, except that you can also tweak the name and appearance of the Focus in the profile’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UEUvja"&gt;So what next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu0Ltz"&gt;Now, when you tap the Focus icon in your Control Center, it will activate all the various features you’ve created for your profile. Note that the last profile that was active will be the one that is featured: for example, if you last used your Driving profile, the Focus button will have the car icon. Touch the icon to active it, or touch the word Focus to switch to a different profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5qtBR"&gt;The new Focus app in iOS 15 can be very useful by helping you concentrate when you need to, by letting you relax when you want to, by keeping unwanted calls and texts from waking you at night, and by keeping you safe from distractions when driving. It may take a while to figure out which profiles you want to set up, and to discovering what combination of factors works for you. But once you’ve got it working, Focus can really make things easier for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple rehires former HomePod engineer to get its software back on track</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/erYLoVBkWHmT94b0ghPPceTy_wc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69997107/jbareham_180202_2266_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sheL58"&gt;Apple has hired a former HomePod engineer, Afrooz Family, to head up the team developing HomePod software, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/apple-hires-new-homepod-software-head-as-it-takes-on-amazon-echo?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which could signal a renewed effort from Apple to make the HomePod more competitive. The company released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679870/new-apple-homekit-features-homepod-mini"&gt;HomePod software version 15&lt;/a&gt; in September, bringing some welcome features like the ability to use one or a pair of HomePod Mini speakers as the default with an Apple TV 4K. But Apple’s smart speaker line faces stiff competition, particularly from Amazon’s and Google’s speakers that are equipped with their smart assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPl4RF"&gt;Family left Apple in 2016, where he was a senior audio engineer, to co-found audio company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsyngspace.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22727249%2Fapple-homepod-software-chief-afrooz-family" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Syng&lt;/a&gt; with ex-Apple designer Christopher Stringer. (A &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; article about Syng described Family as the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b4a88a13-47c3-4bb4-a627-704fdf0c392b"&gt;“secret weapon.”&lt;/a&gt;) Syng’s claim to fame is its Cell Alpha connected speaker, which offers spatial audio in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439925/syng-cell-alpha-wi-fi-speaker-apple-designer-death-star-triphonic"&gt;Death Star-like design&lt;/a&gt;, but it comes with a steep $1,799 price tag. Family left Syng earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWEIYP"&gt;The first HomePod, which was released in 2018, was lauded for its sound quality but was criticized for its high price, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;Apple discontinued it in March&lt;/a&gt;. The company released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;cheaper and smaller HomePod Mini last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJsjrv"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music might be coming to PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJd5IDl5xln_vvgQMbYd-9yMqaY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996911/vpavic_4278_20201030_0150.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KPD4mi"&gt;Spotify has been a music streaming option on the PS5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528372/ps5-streaming-apps-support-day-one-netflix-disney-plus-twitch"&gt;since it launched in November&lt;/a&gt;, giving you the option to listen to your favorite music when playing games. Soon, though, the console might get support for another service: Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CNfL8"&gt;The first clue came earlier this week when a Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/q68jxg/since_when_was_this_a_thing_i_made_a_new_account/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link"&gt;posted a picture&lt;/a&gt; of Apple Music appearing in the PS5’s music menu. The option apparently showed up after they made a new account and tried to link it with Spotify. It seems the app didn’t work, though — the Reddit user also shared a photo of a message that said, “This app is playable only on PS4,” which &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; says is a standard error message when an app isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QIB-lyPsDb0MJy9raBtK9bB3kg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22927945/lji5211pmws71.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/q68jxg/since_when_was_this_a_thing_i_made_a_new_account/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link" target="_blank"&gt;u/HOLYWARS1990&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Reddit user’s photo of Apple Music on PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XvArdn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; said it was also &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-14-it-looks-like-apple-music-may-be-coming-to-playstation-5"&gt;able to see the Apple Music option&lt;/a&gt; when making a new US account, though it wasn’t able to reproduce doing so. The Apple Music option didn’t appear when I tried making a new US account while writing this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ydz91X"&gt;The inconsistency of the Apple Music option suggests that the Reddit user and &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; may have gotten an early peek at something that Sony and Apple have in the works. The two companies worked together recently on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588577/ps5-sony-apple-tv-plus-six-month-trial-subscription"&gt;Apple TV Plus promotion for PS5 owners&lt;/a&gt;, so it seems there’s a relationship there. Apple brought Apple Music to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231790/samsung-smart-tv-apple-music-app-available"&gt;Samsung smart TVs&lt;/a&gt; last year, showing that it is willing to expand the app’s availability beyond Apple platforms. And the app is appearing just days before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;Apple’s October 18th event&lt;/a&gt;, which would be a potential venue for Apple and Sony to announce that the app is coming to PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdqOap"&gt;Sony and Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pressure mounts on Amazon and App Store discrimination in new bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary&amp;amp;nbsp;Hearing Examining Texas Abortion Law" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EAgY24Qll4PShIsoqKrUHnwBqfQ=/2x0:4325x2882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996120/1235582856.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23lhwP"&gt;After months of hearings and negotiations, pressure is growing in the Senate to pass new laws banning online platforms from giving preference to their own products and services over those of their competitors. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators announced plans to introduce a nondiscrimination bill that could reshape Amazon’s online marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nC5IJK"&gt;The American Choice and Innovation Online Act, led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), would prevent platforms like Amazon, Apple, and Google from using their dominance to disadvantage other companies and competitors that use their platforms. In June, House lawmakers voted out a bill sharing the same name from the Judiciary Committee. Klobuchar’s Senate version isn’t identical to the House’s, but shares similar language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EOmJW"&gt;This announcement follows a Wednesday &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; claiming that Amazon used marketplace search data to copy popular products and manipulate results favoring the company’s own knockoff products. A Thursday &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also showed that the company places its products ahead of its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v09bTW"&gt;For years, third-party sellers have accused Amazon of similar behavior. These accusations were part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;a yearslong House antitrust investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Amazon and other tech giants by lawmakers, spurring the original bipartisan bill in the House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgMFrj"&gt;“When dominant tech companies exclude rivals &amp;amp; kill competition, it hurts small businesses and can increase costs for YOU,” Klobuchar said in a tweet on Thursday. “My new bipartisan legislation with [Grassley] will establish new rules of the road to prevent large companies from boxing out their smaller competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReUveI"&gt;Outside of Amazon, the bill could also change how Apple and Google run their app stores, banning the companies from giving preference to their own first-party apps and software. Earlier this year, Apple was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ordered to allow app developers&lt;/a&gt; to send iOS users to payment options outside of those offered by the iPhone manufacturer in a case brought by Epic Games. Google is facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;a similar suit&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2nh35"&gt;As of publication, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1448694019631063045?s=20"&gt;said that at least five Senate Republicans&lt;/a&gt; have signed onto the legislation, including Sens. Cynthia Lummis (WY), Josh Hawley (MO), Lindsey Graham (SC), and John Kennedy (LA). This bipartisan support marks a significant step forward for lawmakers seeking to regulate online marketplaces, showing that both Republicans and Democrats are willing to work together to spur competition in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnFVWe"&gt;“Many ‘critics’ called our bipartisan antitrust bils ‘Democrat bills,’” Buck said in a tweet. “That was false then, and it’s false now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJYHZV"&gt;Despite the measure’s broad congressional support, trade groups like Chamber of Progress issued statements Thursday suggesting that the bill will hurt customer experiences online, not enhance them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ueilx"&gt;“Preventing Amazon from selling Amazon Basics and banning Google’s maps from its search results isn’t going to do anything to make the Internet better for families,” Adam Kovacevich, founder and CEO of Chamber of Progress said in a Thursday statement. “This is like calling a car mechanic to fix your laptop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsjtWs"&gt;The Chamber of Progress coalition partners with tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsJJNn"&gt;Pressure is mounting for Congress to act on online marketplaces and counterfeit products as well. Last week, House lawmakers introduced &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/BILLS-117hr5502ih.pdf"&gt;the INFORM Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would require platforms like Amazon to verify the identities of high-volume sellers in order to curb the sale of knockoff products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEgpTz"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c81HwL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3T9jl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends AirPods Pro repair program for crackling or ANC issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fd4XpFdUwrRRGx7eXmiuL17ewU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69992754/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro, first released in 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRcibj"&gt;Apple has quietly extended a repair program for the AirPods Pro that offers free repairs or replacements for earbuds that have issues with noise cancellation or static. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/q7kov9/psa_apple_silently_extended_the_airpods_pro/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-extends-airpods-pro-repair-program/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) were first to spot the change to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/airpods-pro-service-program-sound-issues"&gt;support page for the repair program&lt;/a&gt;, which now notes that the program covers affected AirPods Pro for three years after their first retail sale, rather than two. The page appears to have been updated at the beginning of October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdzcWg"&gt;The support program was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542846/apple-airpods-pro-repair-recall-program-noise-cancellation-static"&gt;originally introduced in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, one year after the original &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936454/apple-airpods-pro-new-release-date-price-noise-cancellation-design-immersive-sound"&gt;release of the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. It meant that Apple’s repair program was introduced at the exact point that the warranty on launch units was set to expire. With the extension of the repair program to three years, AirPods Pro bought at launch should now be covered right up until October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvyRXC"&gt;As a reminder, Apple says it will fix the following issues with the AirPods Pro: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r8TjET"&gt;Crackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Dz2WK"&gt;Active Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Md31O7"&gt;If you’re experiencing any of these issues, you now have a whole extra year to get off your butt and get a free fix as part of the repair program, which, in our experience, often means Apple giving you an on-the-spot replacement pair to take home. To do so, Apple says you should contact its support team or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or else make an appointment at an Apple Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpNvqt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPKFnB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the iOS app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days. Last spring, iOS 14.5 introduced a new privacy feature called App Tracking Transparency that may have made its users happier but did not endear Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is still available in iOS 15, along with &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/"&gt;some new privacy features&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The version that first appeared in iOS 14.5 allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you don’t have to do anything; you are automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne1PGZ"&gt;(Note: At first, the App Tracking Transparency feature seemed to be misbehaving for some people; it either didn’t respond, or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;the toggle in Tracking was grayed out&lt;/a&gt;. On May 3rd, Apple issued update 14.5.1, which was supposed to fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/03/ios-14-5-1-release-changes/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the fix hasn’t worked for some people; however, at least one staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that his toggle was no longer grayed out. There have been no such problems reported recently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 9:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a note about problems with the new feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4nwEG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 10th, 2:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note about issues with the new feature has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzW1Zi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 5:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to acknowledge that iOS 15 has shipped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Luna Display can now turn your iPad into a second screen for Windows devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/beif1eQuMH4VMcv6Jati_-qdTfw=/195x0:1503x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991001/Screenshot_2021_10_13_12.58.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Astropad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9Ybrs"&gt;Astropad’s Luna Display is a handy way to turn an iPad or another Mac into a wireless external monitor for Apple’s computers. Now the company has updated its wireless dongles &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/luna-5-0-windows/"&gt;to include support for Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt;, a solid step forward for the company after Apple’s Sidecar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651017/apple-ipad-pro-pencil-sidecar-wwdc-2019"&gt;made its functionality a built-in part&lt;/a&gt; of iPadOS and MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQL3ob"&gt;Windows support is included in Luna Display 5.0 and requires “Windows 10 64-bit, Build 1809 or later” and at least iPadOS 12.1, according to Astropad. That means modern Windows devices and iPads can work together in a variety of configurations, including using the Apple Pencil along with an iPad as a very expensive drawing tablet for your Windows machine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zHLEKudq02qN_7p4fS1SjB3FMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924633/lunadisplaywindows.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Astropad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad’s touch controls, gestures, and Pencil support all translate over to Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EIEzg5"&gt;The company is making Luna Display for Windows available in two types of connectors for plugging into your Windows devices, either USB-C and HDMI. Owners of the older USB-C Luna Display are also able to update to add support for Windows starting today. For what it’s worth, Astropad says the restructuring it did for its 5.0 release also means setting up Luna Display on M1 Macs should be faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfXNZZ"&gt;Astropad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/23/16184080/astro-hq-luna-turns-ipad-into-wireless-display"&gt;first launched Luna Display in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, about two years before Apple “sherlocked” it with the Sidecar feature added in macOS Catalina. Not long after, the company updated Luna Display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/18/20920510/luna-display-mac-to-mac-mode-sidecar-sherlocked-apple"&gt;to work wirelessly between Macs&lt;/a&gt; as a response to Apple’s move. “Apple zigs, we zag,” Astropad CEO Matt Ronge &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mronge/status/1184881856598237184?s=20"&gt;tweeted at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRMXdf"&gt;Astropad &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/sherlocked-by-apple/"&gt;has been fairly open&lt;/a&gt; about its experience of being copied, including suggesting it was &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/blessing-in-disguise/"&gt;a blessing in disguise&lt;/a&gt; when it announced it was testing Windows support in beta (other companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124116/apple-developers-sherlocked-blix-bluemail-anonymous-email-feature"&gt;preferred taking legal action&lt;/a&gt;). The Kickstarter for its new Luna Display for Windows dongles &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/767721702/luna-display-for-windows/posts"&gt;launched on September 30th, 2020&lt;/a&gt; and was successfully funded just an hour later. People clearly want this functionality for Windows, and now Astropad is finally offering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9FIlU"&gt;Luna Display is $129 for Mac or PC, with port options for USB-C, HDMI, and Mini DisplayPort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3N85v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ooSC9y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 7 officially ditches the hidden diagnostic port</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7 in green." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xUh-TcvuezoCV_LzFTHy5kW7_uk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990785/vpavic_211006_4796_0029.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d22oPe"&gt;The Apple Watch’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8543033/apple-watch-hidden-port-charging-battery-strap"&gt;diagnostic port&lt;/a&gt; has been a mysterious part of the wearable lineup since its first model, but the new Series 7 officially ditches the six-pin port entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RqFb0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-watch-series-7-lacks-diagnostic-port/"&gt;First noted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the lack of a port can be seen when you remove the bottom strap from an Apple Watch Series 7 — the company has removed the hidden plate and the port behind it. Intended for internal use for diagnostics, the port wasn’t officially acknowledged on Apple’s website or documentation. But the diagnostic port briefly hinted at the possibility of expanding the Apple Watch with hardware accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suxWRo"&gt;The most famous of these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8676901/apple-watch-secret-port-charges-faster"&gt;was the Reserve Strap&lt;/a&gt;, which attempted to use the port for extending the battery life of the Apple Watch by incorporating extra batteries into a specially made band that would slot directly into the diagnostic port. The port actually offered &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; charging than Apple’s own magnetic cable, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmIBnjNnV8fTl2XKhGyRler4aJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924623/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_3.58.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Reserve Strap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1xk1iH"&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11460712/apple-watch-wristband-reserve-strap-accessory-loophole"&gt;Apple quickly blocked that capability&lt;/a&gt; and Reserve Strap (along with virtually every other attempt at harnessing the port for useful purposes). For the subsequent life span of the Apple Watch, it remained useful for its intended purpose: diagnostics for internal Apple use and repairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xP1EOD"&gt;Of course, Apple still needs a way to do diagnostics on the Apple Watch, and appears to be replacing the mysterious port with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690061/apple-watch-series-7-wireless-dock-data-transfer-port-free"&gt;even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; mysterious 60.5GHz wireless module&lt;/a&gt; that pairs with a magnetic dock capable of local data transfer for internal use. That’s led to some speculation that Apple is using the Series 7 as a test bed for a future portless iPhone that could use similar technology to replace cables for connecting to a computer. But if years of the useless diagnostic port have taught us anything, it’s that sometimes there’s no greater meaning or utility to be found in proprietary diagnostic tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDvDWv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 5:17pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added MacRumors sourcing. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Safari extensions on your iPhone and iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZxdtPME6LdsDlwMyFZFoxseD6U0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990647/akrales_210917_4760_0330.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OnAPJ1"&gt;One of the handiest types of software in anyone’s quiver is the browser extension: those cool little applets that let your browser do what you want it to do. And one of the nicest things about iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 is that you can now add extensions to the Safari browser. Even though this is a new feature that launched with the latest iOS version, there are already a number of useful extensions available for you to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YasHh9"&gt;What follows is a rundown on how to add extensions to your Safari app — while we’ve illustrated the process using an iPhone, you can follow the same basic directions with an iPad. We’ve also included a sampling of some extensions you can try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5WSYPV"&gt;How to add extensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PeMPW1"&gt;Tap on the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Asir3B"&gt;Scroll down to and select Safari &amp;gt; Extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TITo5t"&gt;Any extensions that you’ve already installed will be listed here. Tap on “More Extensions” if you’d like to see what’s available in the App Store. (You can also simply go to the App Store and search on “Safari Extensions.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In your settings, go to Safari &amp;amp;gt; Extensions to see your current extensions and get new ones." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3AD67CZ0fV_CpSxi9R5SxShgnpI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924238/makephotogallery.net_1634147611611.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your settings, go to Safari &amp;gt; Extensions to see your current extensions and get new ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="8nqVoA"&gt;Once you’ve installed your first extension, you’ll see a little “puzzle piece” icon on the left side of Safari’s address bar. Tap that, and the menu that pops up will include your current extensions plus a “Manage Extensions” selection, which lets you toggle your extensions on and off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s simple to install a new extension from the App Store." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FtOUJLXJMIdbD7qzlHOPGsr-JmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924199/IMG_62BD37855789_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s simple to install a new extension from the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once installed, you can manage your extensions from the Safari address bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQeRleRBeQ_EwGaNC_62lTg0tr4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924201/IMG_04F0290642C7_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once installed, you can manage your extensions from the Safari address bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="s7Bn4f"&gt;Some extensions to try&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AGDDk3"&gt;This is a small sampling of some of the extensions that you can now access via the App Store. While there are not many extensions yet available (compared to the number of extensions for, say, Chrome), it’s a pretty safe bet that there will be lots more to come over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EcWNOu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amplosion-redirect-amp-links/id1585734696"&gt;Amplosion&lt;/a&gt; ($2.99)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2ac8e"&gt;AMP, which is short for “Accelerated Mobile Pages,” is a web format created by Google to optimize search results for mobile browsers. However, if you’d rather not have Google tweaking the webpages you upload, you can use Amplosion to redirect the AMP links that show up in search results into normal mobile links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gdDvT0"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noir-dark-mode-for-safari/id1581140954"&gt;Noir&lt;/a&gt; ($2.99)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QbnD0m"&gt;When you’re browsing at night and you’ve set your iPhone or iPad to dark mode, you will often hit a website that is bright enough to make your eyes water. Noir allows you to set a dark mode for all the websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2kHdjr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; (subscription needed)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LWSUOV"&gt;1Password is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722617/1password-sharing-link-google-docs-secure"&gt;well-known and respected password manager&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a 1Password user, there’s no question that you’re going to want to add this one to your mobile Safari app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mL3I9c"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-agent-for-safari/id1568262835#?platform=iphone"&gt;Super Agent for Safari&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6RVAs2"&gt;This handy extension automatically fills out a website’s cookie consent forms based on your preferences, which can save you a lot of time and irritation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="avc3ZM"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/web-inspector/id1584825745"&gt;Web Inspector&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iJnWA2"&gt;Something for developers: an app that lets you inspect the HTML coding of a website, modify it, debug it, and perform other essential tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
