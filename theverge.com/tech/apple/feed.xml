    <title>8 new HomeKit features arriving with Apple’s September 20th software updates  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFrB4RSo4qr_67XyNG51mEUjUcU=/0x400:2400x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874081/apple_wwdc21_watchos8_home_doorbell_06072021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sm4we8"&gt;With new iPhones come new features. And starting next week, Apple HomeKit users will get plenty courtesy of iOS 15, HomePod 15, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8 software updates. Apple has confirmed that these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;will all be available on the same day, September 20th&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k51FQ2"&gt;So, if you’ve been excited about unlimited HomeKit Secure Video cameras, the HomePod Mini as a speaker for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22672587/apple-tv-tvos-15-features-release-date"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;, or the chance to see your doorbell on your Apple Watch, you’re in luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vn6TDY"&gt;Here’s a look at all the new HomeKit and HomeKit-related features that will be dropping on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jo8NY2eGt7DG9iorfWFYTw-oYsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22025414/dseifert_201107_4281_0005.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new software update will let you pair a single or pair of HomePod Minis to your Apple TV 4K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6Won2G"&gt;Control your Apple TV with Siri&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="w9RK6D"&gt;Finally, you’ll be able to use Siri to turn your Apple TV on and off, start a specific show or movie, or have it pause or resume playback for you. This has been a feature of Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant for a while now (when paired with a Fire TV device or Chromecast), and we’re pleased to see Apple bringing Siri up to par.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tFdFkO"&gt;Set your HomePod Mini as your Apple TV speaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxwnW"&gt;A single or pair of HomePod Minis can now be your Apple TV 4K’s default speaker. This feature was previously only available to the original (now discontinued) HomePod, but now it’s available for Apple’s more diminutive (and not discontinued) smart speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxuJOq-o28fiEPHDe-8suVrAQzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541099/DSCF3862_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple TV 4K can now show you multiple HomeKit camera feeds on the biggest screen in your house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gUE4J2"&gt;Have your HomeKit cameras spot packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pLPGEg"&gt;Security cameras connected to Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video (Apple’s option for storing footage from your smart home cameras) through an Apple TV 4K or HomePod Mini can now tell you when they see a package. This is in addition to people, animal, and vehicle detection and will increase the usefulness of the two HKSV compatible residential doorbells currently on the market — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163585/logitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video"&gt;Logitech View&lt;/a&gt; and the Netatmo Smart Video Doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SRazyy"&gt;See multiple HomeKit cameras on your Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Im16Y5"&gt;The Apple TV can now stream multiple feeds from your HomeKit cameras instead of only one, so you can survey your domain from the big screen. It will also offer up control of nearby accessories (such as a front door lock or porch light), so you can turn on the lights and unlock the door using the remote - no need to get your phone out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OMjPaC"&gt;Add unlimited HomeKit Secure Video cameras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oVMCFU"&gt;Speaking of multiple cameras, with the iOS15 update on your iPhone and iPad you can now add an unlimited number of cameras to HomeKit Secure Video if you sign up for the new iCloud Plus 2TB plan ($9.99 a month). Previously, 5 was the maximum number allowed, which is a bit limiting if you want to cover a whole home inside and out with cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrV3g8Rm4NYnw6didqLbXbN_KBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16308986/dseifert_190530_3460_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ecobee SmartThermostat is the first confirmed Siri-enabled accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sKsTIh"&gt;Talk to Siri in more places&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vqGlQF"&gt;The voice assistant is coming to other speaker-enabled HomeKit accessories. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features"&gt;Ecobee SmartThermostat&lt;/a&gt; is the only confirmed accessory so far — and the function won’t go live for a few more weeks, according to Ecobee. But it’s likely more devices will follow soon, enabling you to ask Siri to control smart home devices, set timers and alarms, and use the intercom feature in more rooms in your home. You will still need to have a HomePod Mini on the same network for the device to relay the requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AQaTqY"&gt;Tell Siri to do something later&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6VW0TX"&gt;Siri is getting smarter about home control, adding the ability for you to ask the voice assistant to do something later or based on an event. That means you’ll be able to use commands such as “Hey Siri, turn off the lights when I leave home,” or “Hey Siri, turn off the TV at 6 p.m.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vpr6RaUnkXF2S_If_9TwlUqEZrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858560/apple_wwdc21_watchos8_home_doorbell_06072021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new software update for Apple Watch lets you view your HomeKit cameras on your watch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Enr29Y"&gt;Control your home on your wrist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zXy3Gj"&gt;With WatchOS 8, the Apple Home app gets a much-needed redesign. Now you can access individual accessories as well as HomeKit Scenes, and the watch will use context to determine which devices and Scenes to offer up for control. You can also see HomeKit-enabled camera feeds on your wrist and use Intercom to quickly broadcast a message to the whole home, individual rooms, or personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wj04Cg"&gt;To update your HomePod and HomePod Mini’s software, go to the Home Settings in the Apple Home app (you can turn on automatic updates here). For Apple TV 4K, look in the settings menu on your device and for the Apple Watch, use the Watch app on your iPhone or the settings app on the watch itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9ecwb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How and where to replace your old, depleted iPhone battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0mWSVXrKcWvnqpLBF_jKjRUrh0=/0x27:620x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873726/F8M9LXDIM0THNI6.MEDIUM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Credit: Apple Fixer/ Instructables&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKJuw9"&gt;Your iPhone’s aging lithium-ion batteries will eventually start to lose their ability to retain a charge — and that can be highly frustrating, especially if you’re out and about all day. If that is happening to you, there are several solutions: you can switch over to the latest &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPhoneBattery091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, start carrying a battery charger around with you, or — simply replace the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OPFe7"&gt;To first identify whether your battery is ready for a change, you can check to see what the current health of your battery is by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Battery” &amp;gt; “Battery Health.” This is where you can find out your battery’s current maximum capacity. A small notice at the very top may appear if your iPhone’s battery is ready for a swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Battery” page in your iPhone’s settings has info about your battery usage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZBc9kffXfFCa7gpU87-JlyADATY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858291/IMG_FF5BFD69D52F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Battery” page in your iPhone’s settings has info about your battery usage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Battery Health” page will let you know if you need to replace your battery." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izwvsvS0OzJtaWGbzH0tQT9sZ8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858292/IMG_CB3733A4E40D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Battery Health” page will let you know if you need to replace your battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXkgXj"&gt;If you’ve decided to replace the battery, you have two choices: doing it yourself or hiring someone else — like Apple — to do it. Doing it yourself poses several risks — you void any remaining warranty, and you risk breaking your phone. But if you’d rather do it yourself, there are plenty of guides online, and the process is easier than you might imagine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lvRHsm"&gt;DIY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XajF1B"&gt;For those ready to take on this task, a good place to start is iFixit, which offers very in-depth explainers of how to proceed (for example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B11%2BBattery%2BReplacement%2F127450&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22679492%2Fiphone-apple-battery-replace-ifixit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here is one to use if you own an iPhone 11&lt;/a&gt;). There are also a variety of YouTube videos available that offer step-by-step instructions. The process involves unscrewing the back of the phone, mildly heating the lower edge of the phone, using suction cups to remove the display, and follow several steps to remove and replace the battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0TUywh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Feyqwf3cYtw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LK0fm"&gt;Before you start, you’ll need &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bonafide-HardwareTM-Repair-Driver-Pentalobe/dp/B00XZB3WKQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;smartphone repair tools&lt;/a&gt;, which can cost around $13 (iFixit strongly recommends you add a suction tool called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DottorPod-iSclack-Opening-Apple-iPhones/dp/B07HWLYVQN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iSclack&lt;/a&gt;). Some vendors on Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/IBESTWIN-Replacement-Adhesive-Instruction-Capacity/dp/B07QNXHPP1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even sell iPhone battery replacement kits&lt;/a&gt; for this very purpose, which can run around $25 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1mF24"&gt;Be aware that If you do choose to do it yourself and you have a water resistant phone, your phone will no longer be water resistant after you’ve opened it up. In addition, there’s a good chance that your OS will recognize that there is no longer an Apple-manufactured battery in your phone, which means you may get an occasional warning notice and the Battery Health app won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ulr3WR"&gt;Get Apple to do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dsoHLA"&gt;If you’d rather get someone else to replace the battery and not risk tampering with your device, Apple offers replacements under several conditions, according to&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-power"&gt; its website&lt;/a&gt;. If your iPhone is under warranty or you have AppleCare+ and Apple deems the battery defective, repairs are free. But if the problem is due to some other factor that isn’t covered by AppleCare+ — or if you’re not covered by that or by a warranty — you’ll have to pay a service fee of $49 for an iPhone SE (2nd gen) up to an iPhone 8 Plus, or a $69 fee for more recent models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0eR8A"&gt;You can either ship in your phone for repairs or head to an Apple store. A physical store repair could be completed in one visit or, in more complex cases, take up to three to five days, according to Apple. Shipping it in will take a bit longer, as you need to wait for Apple to send you a box to collect your iPhone. In addition, if your phone is out of warranty, there will be a $6.95 shipping fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIASV4"&gt;If Apple replaces your battery for you, the iPhone should continue to be water resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWVN4X"&gt;If all this doesn’t work for you, your timeline, or your budget, there may also be third-party vendors who offer repair services for iPhones in your local neighborhood. But their quality — and whether they use &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FAnswers%2FView%2F343117%2FWill%2BiPhone%2B7%2Bkeep%2Bit%2527s%2Bwater%2Bresistance%2Bafter%2Brepair&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22679492%2Fiphone-apple-battery-replace-ifixit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sealing adhesive&lt;/a&gt; to maintain water resistance — varies by vendor, so always check reviews and ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdiqei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 2021, 3:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on December 21st, 2017, and has been updated to account for service, device, and OS changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s seven-minute tour shows off what’s new in the iPhone 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAZdcCDnKArVTjMvX8yLXTCnTqw=/237x0:2643x1604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873250/Screen_Shot_2021_09_17_at_10.36.28_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KmGBoC"&gt;Apple released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72cAe_2LAFQ"&gt;a seven-and-a-half-minute video&lt;/a&gt; to act as a guided tour of the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro’s features, and to make the differences in the lineup clearer. In the clip, Apple also goes through some of the phone’s new video and camera features like cinematic mode, photographic styles, and macro photography, and emphasizes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;the phones’ increased battery life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqaxXR"&gt;The video doesn’t really give us any new info, but it does give us more (obviously very carefully crafted) footage of the iPhone 13 outside of a blank black or white background.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HctLZqqQhp8zY9fzFBVqcTIAmhM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858279/Screen_Shot_2021_09_17_at_10.56.48_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a good idea of what your fancy iPhone 13 Pros will look like covered in iced tea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0nvRcu"&gt;Also, the video has &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/72cAe_2LAFQ?t=218"&gt;a particularly funny scene&lt;/a&gt;, meant to show off the phone’s durability, where a skateboarder crashes and sets off a Three Stooges-esque cascade of accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I24FgSZ4Q2Tluv9hERogBdWlyQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858224/apple_gif_optimized.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mondays, am I right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3cOahz"&gt;If you’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665413/apple-event-iphone-13-announcements-news-products"&gt;soaking in all the iPhone 13 info&lt;/a&gt; this week, you’ll probably be fine giving the video a skip, but it’s a nice refresher if you’ve only casually been paying attention and are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;considering pre-ordering today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nUPkk8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/72cAe_2LAFQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="evzXav"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup&lt;/a&gt; comes with the biggest change Apple has made to the front of its iPhones since it first introduced Face ID with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review"&gt;iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;: that controversial notch has finally been shrunken down a bit. Apple says the new notch is about 20 percent smaller than the old one, although eagle-eyed observers have noticed it comes with the tradeoff of being a hair taller, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDtY9x"&gt;The new and improved notch is still a notch. A big notch, too, compared to the hole-punch cameras and teardrop cutouts that competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;like Samsung&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; have been offering on their flagship phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyF7Oh"&gt;Naturally, we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have some thoughts on the subject: is the notch worth it in 2021? Or does it need to go the way of the dinosaur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DHmSDR"&gt;
&lt;p id="egbcNs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve been using a notched iPhone since the iPhone X first launched, and I’m a notch apologist at this point. Compared to the bezel-heavy style that preceded it, it’s an obvious improvement; it’s hard to go back to the older iPhone SE style. And while a lot of Face ID-based features have turned out to be pretty gimmicky (looking at you, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16735822/animoji-karaoke-tutorial-iphone-x"&gt;Memoji and Animoji&lt;/a&gt;), the core functionality here is still really, really great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjhd3o"&gt;When it comes to unlocking a phone, Face ID just works, and it works well. And that’s largely because it does need all the tech that Apple fits in (including the various sensors, IR emitters, and the actual front-facing camera.) True, Android phones don’t have notches like the iPhone, but they also don’t have facial unlock systems that work nearly as well. And if a notch is the price to pay for convenience, it’s one I can accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYzWH0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean Hollister: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure, I admit Face ID is fantastic. It was the single greatest thing about switching from Android for me. I couldn’t believe how easy it was to log into my bank, check my medical records, or access and copy/paste my password manager’s passwords when I made an iPhone 12 Mini my daily driver last year. But that’s just as much a jab at Android as it is praise for the iPhone — because what I love is &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt;, which has nothing to do with my face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bUtXY5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Speed has nothing to do with my face&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5pcCm8"&gt;Why hasn’t Android standardized on an excellent, fast fingerprint sensor, one placed precisely where I leave my digits anyhow? Why did Apple always insist on fitting it into the bottom bezel of its phones where I’d have to awkwardly stretch down? Why not mount a fingerprint-reading camera in that iPhone logo Apple always loves to leave on the back of its phones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaXHjl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: A rear fingerprint reader would mess with Apple’s easily shattered lovely looking slab of glass on the back, though. If the company can nail an under-glass fingerprint reader, they’re better off just sticking one on the front of the phone under the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yWEGO"&gt;The one thing I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; see an argument for is bringing back Touch ID, integrated into the power button (like on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; and the recent iPad Air.) But even if you were to do that, Apple would still have to find somewhere to put the front-facing camera. Hiding it away in the bezels won’t work on an iPhone; there’s just simply nowhere to put it. And choosing between a small notch with less functionality and a marginally larger one with more, Face ID is an easy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ijGU5leA7gYTi_720eLC0BfzSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850355/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini, with Touch ID.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G7Lcr6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;They could put it where everyone else puts it these days: a tiny hole instead of a giant notch. Or how about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;those under-display selfie cameras&lt;/a&gt; we’ve heard so much about? Speaking of which, what keeps Apple from giving us an under-display fingerprint sensor, or sticking the guts of Face ID into the hole in a hole-punch display, too? I’m not saying the notch bugs me every single time I look at the screen (OLED works wonders), but surely you don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a notch just to fit a couple of fancy IR blasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEfHpg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: Right now it sounds like under-display cameras are still a bit more trouble then they’re worth; assuming Apple gets on board with that, it’d imagine it’ll still be some time before the tech catches up to the idea of what it could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urqYJH"&gt;But even if they were, there’s a lot more to Face ID than just a couple of fancy IR blasters. Remember this slide from when Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16288806/apple-iphone-x-price-release-date-features-announced"&gt;announced the iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S569GXo7aLn-mHvKIdf_Gxq4JRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9230639/apple_iphone_2017_20170912_11726.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s inside the iPhone’s notch, circa iPhone X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2OZw3Z"&gt;That seems like it’d be more difficult to cram into a hole punch cutout — even if Apple was willing to go with a larger one, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus&lt;/a&gt;’ double-camera cutout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm3AMN"&gt;Of course, the biggest argument in favor of bringing a fingerprint reader back is the stark reality of 2020 and 2021: the fact that we’re all wearing masks all the time, and that Face ID, frankly, is terrible when you’re wearing a mask. But hopefully that issue will improve if (when?) the pandemic starts to ebb, and I can go back to easily unlocking my phone when I’m out and about again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjmFnE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;Hey! I was saving that argument for later. Cutting me off at the pass is a dirty trick. So do you agree that speed matters more than the fact that Face ID uses your face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yy2nuA"&gt;Okay, let’s pretend for a moment that Face ID actually requires a linear array of components (even though the speaker, microphone, ambient light sensor and proximity sensor in that image all feature in standard phones and almost all of them could easily be placed on a phone’s rim). What’s so wrong about giving a phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;a little bit of forehead&lt;/a&gt; instead of a notch, like the Pixel 4’s Face ID competitor? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BLIvC7sjrH7T4cLd3x1x_ZujPOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19302260/vpavic_191016_3730_0082.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 4 stuck its sensors inside its forehead instead of a notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RjrFbf"&gt;Stick some extra battery underneath the additional height that change would afford — or hell, how about a good ol’ headphone jack. Design certainly isn’t the reason that particular Pixel failed; it was panned for lackluster battery life and gimmicks, and probably didn’t have anywhere near &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;enough marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cSc6d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: I mean, design may have had something to do with it, but the Pixel 4 helps prove my point: Google was cramming way more tech than even Face ID had for the sake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/30/21496318/google-soli-radar-motion-sense-rick-osterloh-pixel-5"&gt;gimmicky Soli gestures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="letRMx"&gt;And taking up the whole top of the phone for a camera array feels like a worse situation than the notch; at least with the notch, you can still nominally use the top area of the phone as a status bar thanks to the “rabbit ears” of screens on the side (something that previous versions of iOS had to devote useful pixel space for.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Llo3e"&gt;There’s also the chance that Apple could one day add Touch ID back to the iPhone, either in button or in-display form. But even if it does, it’s hard for me to imagine the company backtracking from Face ID at this point. Which means that like it or not, Sean, you’ll probably have to suffer a notch for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HGlMWK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;I guess I kinda like the rabbit ears. But suffer, I will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pXeN7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRANRc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwqbhc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KACKtl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKICbv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejbLCS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoxaZ2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook tells Apple employees he’s ‘looking forward to moving forward’ after Epic ruling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iq80HEV7RCR4gvDyHj2oHqRVItE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873004/1233030828.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ipmKjv"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that he was “looking forward to moving forward” after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;a verdict in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; antitrust case&lt;/a&gt;. In an all-hands meeting with employees, Cook echoed the line Apple has taken publicly on the case, celebrating the company’s legal wins and downplaying its loss on an unfair competition claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngNyVt"&gt;“If you sort of back up and remember what the App Store is about, the App Store was built to be a trusted place for users so they could go explore and discover apps. It was meant to be a great business opportunity for developers,” Cook told employees, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Epic came along and wanted basically to be handled in a special way. Our rules are that we treat everyone the same. They ask us repeatedly to treat them different, we said no, and they sued us on 10 different items. The court ruled nine of those in favor of Apple and one in favor of Epic. Most importantly, they ruled that Apple is not a monopoly, which we’ve always known. Apple is in a fiercely competitive market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CR0Kgk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There were one or two sentences scratched out of an agreement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2SQ7Fw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21396313/apple-fortnite-lawsuit-emails-app-store-ban-epic"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney asked Apple&lt;/a&gt; last year to let it include alternate payment methods in its iOS version of the game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. However, Sweeney said that Epic “hope[d] that Apple will also make these options equally available to all iOS developers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5yp2C"&gt;Contrary to Cook’s statement that “we treat everyone the same,” Apple has provided special treatment to a variety of app developers in the past. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;It offered Netflix a special deal&lt;/a&gt; where it took just a 15 percent cut of subscriptions sold inside the app, and weighed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;offering special perks to Netflix&lt;/a&gt; if the streaming video company would maintain support for in-app purchases. The company also carved out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;categories of apps&lt;/a&gt; that can bypass its commission for in-app purchases, and blocked or decided not to feature apps it seemingly feared might compete. You can see examples of special treatment for particular developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;in our collection of unearthed emails&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSMwHo"&gt;Cook is correct, however, that a California judge ruled Apple didn’t have a monopoly in digital gaming transactions — the relevant market in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;. The company successfully avoided Epic’s demands that it open up iOS to third-party app stores and sideloaded apps, and the court said Apple was justified in collecting a commission on digital goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OyR1Wk"&gt;Cook didn’t confirm whether Apple planned to appeal its one loss: the verdict that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;Apple’s anti-steering rules&lt;/a&gt; (which restrict developers from telling users about alternate payment options) violate California’s Unfair Competition Law. The ruling orders Apple to abandon the rules by December. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;Epic has indicated&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to appeal its own losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcz7gj"&gt;But like Apple spokespeople &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;have done publicly&lt;/a&gt;, Cook suggested he wasn’t overly worried. “I think the ruling will be very good to try to put some of the discussions to rest on the App Store. In terms of the one we lost, there were one or two sentences scratched out of an agreement, that was the extent of it. I’m sort of looking forward to moving forward now,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new COVID-19 policy requires vaccinations to skip ‘frequent’ testing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Requires Masks Be Worn At Most Stores After New CDC Recommendations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-eOaaDHh2M9uJIarcvYnMFdl4Bs=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872984/1331332668.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fu5aS6"&gt;Starting next month, Apple will “infrequently” test employees who come into its offices and stores for COVID-19, if they’re vaccinated. Unvaccinated employees will have to get frequent testing. Apple CEO Tim Cook and senior vice president of retail and people Deirdre O’Brien announced the new policy during an all-hands meeting today, according to an audio recording obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79oLQu"&gt;The company’s updated guidelines appear to line up with the OSHA standards that will be established as a result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666508/biden-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;the Biden administration’s push to increase vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;. Those standards say companies of 100 people or more must require either immunization or weekly testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG6Fmv"&gt;Apple recently pushed back the date when it expects employees to return to its office in response to a surge of cases and the Delta variant. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;internal email in August&lt;/a&gt; specified that the mandatory return is delayed until at least January 2022, and employees can expect a one-month notice ahead of time before it goes into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PaD0S"&gt;During the meeting, Cook told employees that “we need to learn” about a hybrid workplace after years of being entirely in the office and the last 18 months or so at home. For now, Apple will give everyone in the company three extra days off next quarter. For employees in the US, those days will come the week of Thanksgiving, while teams in other countries will set their dates independently.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s exactly how much bigger the iPhone 13 batteries are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_H_cxPwPw1U4RLD0hhlomI-9P8=/434x314:2357x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872865/Screen_Shot_2021_09_16_at_5.35.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y76x0s"&gt;We’ve just gotten our first look at the iPhone 13s’ battery sizes, thanks to a product information sheet &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fmore-resources%2Fgtc.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F17%2F22678607%2Fiphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;posted on Apple’s behalf&lt;/a&gt; to hazardous material information and response company &lt;a href="https://app.clickdimensions.com/blob/chemtreccom-aczvc/files/apis_bpisreportupdated20210916.pdf?1631813744835"&gt;Chemtrec’s website&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/16/iphone-13-battery-life/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The document shows that the batteries in iPhones have gotten significantly bigger since last year — 13 percent larger, on average — and the 13 Pro Max’s battery is getting comparable to devices like the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNcqjd"&gt;In the document, battery sizes are reported in watt-hours instead of the more traditional milliamp hours. Even though most phone manufacturers give battery sizes in milliamp hours, they’re often &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/watts-in-a-name-why-were-using-watt-hours-to-compare-batteries/"&gt;less accurate and harder to compare&lt;/a&gt; devices, so we prefer watt-hours. Here are the battery sizes of Apple’s new phones and the previous-gen models, according to the document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pdIdxH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10757785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2EYbYy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fmore-resources%2Fgtc.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F17%2F22678607%2Fiphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; it provides this information to Chemtrec to help carriers comply, so this information comes directly from the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KxUwvs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 12 and 12 Pro had the same size battery, but the 13 and 13 Pro seemingly don’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDpfkR"&gt;A few things jump out in the chart. The sizes have obviously gotten significantly bigger across the board, and there’s one weird year-over-year change: the 12 and 12 Pro used to have the same size battery, but now the 13 Pro’s battery is actually smaller than the 13’s. The phones are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;the same physical size,&lt;/a&gt; and the Pro is packing a higher refresh rate screen, an extra GPU core, and more cameras, so it makes sense if there’s less room for the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1MSRz"&gt;Apple also made each model slightly thicker and heavier than its predecessor. With this iPhone 13 lineup, the company seemingly makes the same tradeoff as it did with the 11: bigger phones with a better battery (a move that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20859715/iphone-11-pro-max-battery-life-size-thickness-weight-apple"&gt;garnered a good amount of praise&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZN5KK"&gt;As a few points of comparison, here are the rated capacities we were able to find for other phones and devices by consulting iFixit’s teardowns: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="R6BDva"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/m4vrgZ3PqskbyvKM.huge"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;: 18.84Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p36QTs"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oR3xLWXumQOWvDOi.huge"&gt;Google Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;: 15.48Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UfT2Nd"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fGLArIvH1JFVZruL.huge"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;: 16.96Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZybyL"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FMbVvMqgfc4HxXFV.huge"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;: 16Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LDKPhp"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPad%2BAir%2B4%2BTeardown%2F141032&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F17%2F22678607%2Fiphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;: 28.93Wh (the same capacity noted in the Chemtrec document)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DCjeMQ"&gt;According to the numbers found in the document, the 13 Pro Max’s 16.75Wh battery represents a healthy fraction of what you’ll find in some laptop batteries. It’s got 71 percent of the capacity of my ThinkPad T480’s main battery (rated for 23.48Wh), and it’s a bit more than 33 percent of the MacBook Air’s all-day 49.9 watt-hour battery. Plus, it’s bigger than the Switch’s battery, and that thing can run &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqjGcGKlVAElNFJ3tyaA1-HB8j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22856676/Screen_Shot_2021_09_16_at_5.43.10_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says the iPhone 12 Pro Max will get you 2.5 hours further into your day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hIxjqF"&gt;Given that the phones’ processor is changing and displays are getting brighter, it’s hard to say how much real-world battery life these battery size increases can give you. In its presentation, Apple said that the new batteries would last 1.5 hours “longer in your day” for the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=3154"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=4401"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and 2.5 hours later for the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=3156"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=4407"&gt;13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;. By Apple’s measure, if your iPhone 12 tapped out at 9:30PM, it expects the iPhone 13 will make it to midnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LSK5MX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to say how much extra time you’ll actually get using your phone at this point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YmdME7"&gt;It’s not a particularly meaningful metric without context (though according to Apple, the iPhone 13 will get 4 more hours of streamed video playback than its predecessor, and the 13 Pro Max will get 13 more hours), so we’ll have to wait to see how the phones hold up to real-life usage and how they fare in the side-by-side rundown tests. However, Apple has made the battery a selling point for these phones, so it’s in the company’s best interest to back that up with some impressive numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CI38y2"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3uSSl"&gt;This biggest tech story this week: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s hardware event&lt;/a&gt;. Nilay, Dieter, and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz discuss everything announced at the event — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673993/apple-fitness-plus-workouts-countries-languages-pilates-snow"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; —  and how they stack up against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;last year's models&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of rumors we discussed over the past couple of weeks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"&gt;didn’t turn out to be true&lt;/a&gt;, with instead just minor updates. So was this an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675797/iphone-13-12s-upgrade-cycle-iterative-improvements"&gt;“S” event?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5M9kxv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpM43r"&gt;After analyzing the new hardware season, keep listening for some other gadget news, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;Nintendo finally adding Bluetooth audio to the Switch&lt;/a&gt; and why the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;Pixel 6 Tensor chip sounds really weird&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iPhone’s location tracking </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leEXkTb0hpgtXR8qvSk-3L4t47o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69871891/akrales_190913_3628_0277.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TeBzxN"&gt;Your iPhone uses information from your cell service, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to pinpoint its location, and since you almost always have your phone on you, your location as well. That information can be useful for a lot of things, such as letting others know where you are or finding your phone when it’s lost. Other times, it’s just more data that services and companies collect about you, creating privacy concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2rbnr"&gt;The good news is you can tighten your controls so that apps are only accessing your location when it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGeN94"&gt;Toggling your location settings can differ from phone to phone, depending on what model of iPhone you have and what version of iOS it’s running. The following directions were tested on an iPhone 11 running iOS 15; if you’re running a different version of iOS, there shouldn’t be much difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nJYdGZ"&gt;Turn off location access for specific apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2bachq"&gt;Location data is useful for some apps (for example, if you want to order food) and necessary for others, like maps or ride-shares. However, if an app asks for your location and you don’t feel it needs the data, you can disable location services for that app. Here’s how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="10QMkI"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yjxmeM"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XXWXWw"&gt;“Location Services” will most likely be switched on. Unless you want to completely cut all location services off (see below), leave it alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qwmyHl"&gt;Scroll down to find a list of all the apps that enable location services. Each listing will show the app’s name and the type of permission it has: “Never,” “When Shared,” or “While Using.” “When Shared” refers to the option “Ask Next Time Or When I Share.” Meanwhile, “While Using” will usually mean “While using the App,” but it can sometimes also refer to “While Using the App or Widgets.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APxPyw"&gt;If you want to change a specific app’s access to your location data, click on the app listing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can adjust location services for specific apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSpH0kbFBBPq3Pdd52RfatmGL9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857412/IMG_13B4445EF110_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can adjust location services for specific apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How you can allow location access depends on the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BpBbvHInOumIiH0y2cORf5Nv3bw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857413/IMG_6D2F84330D37_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you can allow location access depends on the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0xJQiW"&gt;If you click “While Using the App,” then that app will have access to your location either when it’s open or when it’s in use in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4mvxq"&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services” at the bottom of the “Location Services” screen. Here, you can toggle location access for a number of things, including Wi-Fi, time zone, emergency calls, and Apple News and App Store ads that are relevant to your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YugSqN"&gt;To the left of some of the service toggles, you may see a small arrow. A hollow arrow means the item may have access to your location under certain conditions; a purple arrow means the item has recently used your location, while a gray arrow means it used your location sometime in the last 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1BI4ULPUOLpp4D6EXdpLY1UeSoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857589/IMG_11AB5BCB37D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Arrows show which apps are accessing your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0NqNW6ZvUftQBR3XzifVQDNuOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857582/IMG_4283119948D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrows show which apps are accessing your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f9PkYM"&gt;To check whether your phone is still collecting location data, go down to the very bottom of the “System Services” screen and toggle the switch on for “Status Bar Icon.” This will display an arrow at the top of your screen when an app on your phone is accessing your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvTXrC"&gt;If you want to truly go off the grid, you can disable location services to prevent your phone from collecting any location data at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r8HSiU"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hknF2h"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4s36Y6"&gt;Toggle the “Location Services” switch to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="affITu"&gt;You’ll get a notice telling you that, while Location Services will be disabled for all apps, it will temporarily come online if you use the “Find My iPhone” and report your phone lost. Select “Turn Off.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CcJJeH"&gt;If you have an iPhone 11 or later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NSGXGW"&gt;If you have a phone designed with Apple’s U1 chip — such as an iPhone 11 or later — and have disabled location services for specific apps, you may find that you still sometimes see the arrow. According to Apple, this is because these models &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997338/apple-ultra-wideband-u1-chip-iphone-11-pro-location-data-request-privacy-issue"&gt;use ultra wideband technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple says is regulated, so the phones use location services to determine if they’re in an area where ultra wideband use is restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwciFf"&gt;The iPhone requests location data when location preferences are set on an app-per-app basis, so switching off location services for your phone overall will stop these location requests since your phone won’t be able to collect any location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0BmHZV"&gt;Share your location with individuals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AvJ5VO"&gt;If you’re walking alone at night or you’re in an Uber by yourself, you might want a friend or family member to know your location in real time. If you have iOS 13 or later, you can use the Find My app to share your location with family and friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yd7T8R"&gt;Open “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qRKhHK"&gt;Go into “Privacy,” and make sure “Location Services” is switched on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZS7j0A"&gt;Go back to the main “Settings” menu and tap on your name at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wO93M2"&gt;Select “Find My.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ADpOmK"&gt;Toggle “Share My Location” so that it’s on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aajRcv"&gt;Then go to the Find My app. If this is your first time using the app, it will ask you whether you want it to access your location. Choose either to “Allow While Using App,” “Allow Once,” or “Don’t Allow.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EP4LB6"&gt;You may get a screen explaining that “Find My” can be used with an AirTag or for AirPods, and that there are apps for the watchOS as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C2oZkD"&gt;On the map screen that appears, select “People” at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TJymR1"&gt;Click the button that says “Start Sharing Location.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="poO8DJ"&gt;In the “To:” field, type in either the phone number or name of your friend or family member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MMwj9E"&gt;If the person you select has a phone number that isn’t associated with an iPhone, you’ll be notified with a pop-up. (But you can still share your location.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v9RYlu"&gt;Tap “Send,” then select either “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Find My app lets you share your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoCeKInZlvEqdEYDXrfO3-0j4qs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857616/IMG_425BFDC7C40D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Find My app lets you share your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDV8vATBkeqsU6AiIwFDxv73JN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857538/IMG_80499A0AC888_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OLskUW"&gt;It will then start sharing your location. In order to switch it off, click on your contact’s name in the “Find My” app under “People,” then tap “Stop Sharing My Location.” Confirm by clicking on the “Stop Sharing Location” button that pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YX8aIT"&gt;Send recurring notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="alLgD7"&gt;You can have your phone send out recurring notifications as well. These are useful if you want your friend or relative to know when a you get to a location (or don’t get there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4aqISQ"&gt;In the “Find My” app, tap the “People” tab at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ikQYZL"&gt;Select the person you want to send notifications to (it should be somebody you’re already sharing your location with).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Oj16lY"&gt;Scroll down until you see “Notifications” and tab “Add.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4QBnWx"&gt;A pop-up from the bottom will give you the option to notify that person. Select it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TzQf1e"&gt;You can notify the person when you arrive at or leave a specific location, and send the notification just once or every time you arrive or leave (for example, if you want to let somebody know every day when you get home from work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KY2bKD"&gt;Share via Messages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uB02dt"&gt;You can share your location through Messages as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LrbY2N"&gt;Open a conversation in Messages. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VCb4XE"&gt;Tap on the contact name and then click “Info.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="25EDCT"&gt;This will give you the option to “Share My Location,” which will give you the option to “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.” Click one of those to start sharing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ScUruo"&gt;If you want to stop sharing, click “Stop Sharing My Location” where “Share My Location” was. A button labeled “Stop Sharing My Location” will pop up. Click on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="KqQCyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 2021, 10:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on December 12th, 2019, and has been updated to account for differences in iOS and in available services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKF7xFC4hTYRm-7tz1b73WWCeWk=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857848/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the colors of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIBU9V"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;a fleet of new products at its “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;. Chief among them — you guessed it — was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. This one is coming in various sizes and colors, but with smaller notches, the new A15 Bionic chipset, and with redesigned and improved cameras located around the back. Going from smallest to largest, Apple will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and finally the iPhone 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;With the Pro and Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be able to get the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage, along with 120Hz refresh rate displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1YGEt"&gt;If you’re looking forward to ordering any of the four iPhone 13 models, the good news is you can preorder now, and it should arrive on release day, which is Friday, September 24th. Based on years prior, the ship date can slip later if you order them closer to release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIozlV"&gt;If you’re curious about all of the options and how much it’ll all cost, we’ve listed all of that info below for buying unlocked. All of the carrier-specific promos, including trade-in deals, are listed at the bottom of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7zyyJ"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7E96Ug"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is the 2021 iteration on the Mini phone form factor with a 5.4-inch OLED screen. Apple says that this newer version should get better battery life than the previous model. Battery life was one of the few disappointments in the iPhone 12 Mini, so it’s good that Apple seems to have made improvements here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytXyfk"&gt;Apple will offer the iPhone 13 Mini starting with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $729&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to opt for more storage with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; versions for $829 or $1,029, respectively. If you purchase through a carrier via Apple’s site, the starting price of each configuration drops $30, starting at $699. If you want to trade in your phone, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check for its value right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nPdN53"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DVnDHN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 has a 6.1-inch OLED display, the same size as last year’s model. Like other models this year, Apple upgraded the internal chipset to the A15 Bionic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NHlw2"&gt;Preorders will begin Friday, September 17th at Apple. Buying them unlocked will cost you $30 more than buying through a carrier, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $829 for the 128GB version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$929 for the 256GB version&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,129 for the 512GB version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGvHEm"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find out your phone’s value at Apple&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in for credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BaJlBq"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eBv8ru"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are the biggest and most capable models coming out of Apple in 2021. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch OLED display with an A15 Bionic chipset, while the Pro Max has a bigger 6.7-inch OLED. Both support up to 120Hz refresh rate, which is an improvement that’s long been anticipated. However, you’ll also pay a lot more for this model than the base iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAUxcl"&gt;At Apple, the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models start at $999 and $1,099, respectively. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; will run you $1,099, while the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; will cost $1,199. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration&lt;/a&gt; of either model will also cost an extra $200, with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,499 and the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,599. Unlike the iPhone 13 Mini and standard iPhone 13, there’s no $30 price difference if you choose to purchase the Pro line unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHpfYv"&gt;As mentioned before, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s site can tell you how much your current phone is worth&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wmtN87"&gt;iPhone 13 lineup carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jzmr1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; Current and new Verizon users can save on any of the iPhone 13 models with a trade-in if you’re on certain unlimited plans, billed back to you in monthly credits over the course of 24 or 30 months. New customers can get an additional $500 worth in credits by switching carriers to Verizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74PqP"&gt;How much you’ll get in trade-in credit varies depending on the phone you want, with up to $1,000 back in billing credits if you buy the iPhone 13 Pro Max and have an unlimited plan. If you’re after the 128GB iPhone 13 Pro that usually costs $999, trading in select phones can make it free after you’ve received billing credits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n71NlO"&gt;If you want the iPhone 13, Verizon will offer those on an unlimited plan up to $800 for a trade-in, and you’ll get reimbursed via billing credits. For an iPhone 13 Mini, trade in values cap at $700.  &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.verizon.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKEbcd"&gt;According to a Verizon spokesperson, these are the phones that will get the most amount of trade-in value (though the carrier will accept most phones in any condition, but battery damage is a deal-breaker): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vp61Ou"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3SAWq"&gt;These are the mid-tier devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xce8xP"&gt;Apple: iPhone X and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u4VbAe"&gt;Samsung: GS9 and Note 9 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OSmNtc"&gt;Google: Pixel 4A and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lcmacj"&gt;Kyocera: DuraForce Ultra &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5PQFGX"&gt;LG: V50 ThinQ and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3IkQLY"&gt;Motorola: Moto One 5G, RAZR, Edge Plus &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FgPHff"&gt;Nokia: 8 V 5G &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a1j0LX"&gt;OnePlus: 7 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UxtFME"&gt;Sony: Xperia 1 and up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jp0kUn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; New and existing T-Mobile users can get up to $800 in trade-in credit toward an iPhone 13 series phone. This deal is available for customers on the Max plan, and you’ll get the credit paid back to you in 30 monthly bill credits. T-Mobile’s “Forever Upgrade” initiative will let Max plan holders get up to $800 in trade-in credit for future trade-ins, including this one. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-iphone-deals%2Fupgrade-benefits&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665165%2Fapple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit T-Mobile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nQiuJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; New and current AT&amp;amp;T subscribers on an unlimited plan who trade in a phone, then purchase an iPhone 13 series phone on an installment plan can get a good deal after all of the billing credits have come in. You can get up to $1,000 in billing credits if you trade in a phone that’s worth $180 or higher, making the iPhone 13 Pro Max a better deal. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-128gb-silver.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
