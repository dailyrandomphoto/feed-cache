    <title>The Apple Watch SE costs just $219 at Amazon and Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vGNEa1PrOUMerlqjGUsjdcDgiM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177423/dseifert_200930_4218_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="82lp7r"&gt;A proverbial tidal wave of deals crashed down this morning, heralding the beginning of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday week&lt;/a&gt;. As I searched for deals to include in this roundup, I kept finding one after the other that was better. If you think these are good, consider acting fast, as it’s impossible to tell if they’ll stick around all week or if they’re just a flash in the pan. The very best discount that kicked off recently is a big $60 discount on the Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2ht3XXw2g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Starlight/dp/B09G9FS5YN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Regularly selling for $279, it’s just $219 — the lowest price yet. If you want the larger 44mm-sized model, it’s $249 instead of $309. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3pUJv7ioh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can shop all of the sizes and colorways right here at Best Buy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhOMfR"&gt;We heartily recommend the SE over the Apple Watch Series 3, despite the fact that the Series 3 is seeing tremendous discounts at Walmart (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it will be just $109 starting tonight&lt;/a&gt;). The Apple Watch SE is considerably faster and more capable, with additional features and more storage to make updating its software far less of a hassle. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the latest model of Samsung’s pocket-friendly portable SSD, and it’s just $110 instead of $170. We’ve seen it reach a low of $140 before, but this is yet another unprecedented Black Friday deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2t910"&gt;When the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262517/samsung-t7-usb-c-nvme-portable-ssd-speed-t5-comparison-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T7 launched in mid-2020&lt;/a&gt;, its 500GB version sold for the same $110 price that the model with twice its internal storage capacity is selling for today. It includes a Type-A adapter in case you’re a little lacking in compatible devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aAl6cu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556309"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r91QDa"&gt;You can snag a digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; for Xbox (compatible with Xbox One, Series S, or Series X) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Effect-Legendary-Xbox-Digital/dp/B08ZFDL2RK?th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $28 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The deal has wiggled well below its original $60 price a few times before, but it hasn’t gone below about $35. This collection contains the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; trilogy and several DLC items, all looking fresh to death in 4K (that is, if your console outputs to 4K).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PGVmZx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9565277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JtAB9i"&gt;If you’re looking for more gaming deals, check out our post yesterday that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22769909/nintendo-black-friday-deals-2021-switch-ring-fit-adventure-mario-kart-console-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;includes all of Nintendo’s excellent Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, including where to get its &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; console bundle, as well as many first-party Nintendo games that are selling for just $27. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/21/22789487/oculus-quest-2-vr-headset-50-gift-card-black-friday-promo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the gift card promo for the Oculus Quest 2 is happening&lt;/a&gt;, and several retailers will toss in a $50 gift card with the purchase of a headset at regular price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FzTzhf"&gt;If you’re a high-rolling PC gamer, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-49-inch-Odyssey-FreeSync-LC49G95TSSNXZA/dp/B088HH6LW5?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 49-inch Odyssey G9 curved gaming monitor is selling for $1,000&lt;/a&gt;. Believe it or not, that is this model’s lowest price yet, dropping $400 off its usual price. This ultrawide monitor has a QLED panel with a 5120 x 1440 resolution, a 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and support for G-Sync and FreeSync Premium Pro adaptive sync. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My colleague Sean Hollister reviewed this model&lt;/a&gt;, and he was impressed with its vivid colors and 1,000 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KJIOp4"&gt;A few more early Black Friday deals to whet your whistle&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ymSCVgQ1EyxfS2GWFiLZ64jXkoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177196/cwelch_202109_4775_5619.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5KTAD"&gt;Whether you’re overdue for a new pair or are just trying to cancel out the usual onslaught of holiday music, Black Friday season is a great time to invest in some noise-canceling headphones. You’ll find significant discounts on many of our favorite headphones featured in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;noise-canceling headphones buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. These include picks from Sony, Bose, Apple, Sennheiser, and others. In some cases, these deals will save you $100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKhJxM"&gt;Aside from the steep discounts, another good thing about buying headphones during the holidays is the extended return period at many retailers. That gives you plenty of time to try out your new cans and make sure the sound quality, ANC, comfort, and other factors are all to your liking before you’re stuck with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="maTlax"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021: news, deal highlights, and money-saving tips ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"},{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="BdzHRb"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones deals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="zyLNwd"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 remain our overall pick as the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy today. They’ve got excellent noise cancellation, lively bass-forward sound, and fantastic comfort. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="3mytn2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875864"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ApgUlE"&gt;Released only a few months ago, Bose’s QuietComfort 45 headphones mark a return to the company’s classic design that has no equal when it comes to comfort. You can wear these things for hours upon hours without any issues. It also helps that Bose made improvements to sound quality and ANC compared to the QC35 II headphones. The QC45s haven’t really been on sale since their release, so the Black Friday 2021 deals are coming at just the right time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="D4gpLa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="3wgngs"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max can be had for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$439 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from their hefty $549 standard price. You’ll get that deal on the black, blue, and white colors, though green and pink are a bit higher (but still on sale) at $479.  The AirPods Max justify their price with top-tier sound quality, terrific noise cancellation, great voice call performance, and the usual deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jCtQQh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880023"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="pmB83v"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 Wireless &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are all the way down to $247.46&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon, saving you over $100 compared to their regular $400 price tag. With a classy, premium look and feel that’s matched by their phenomenal audio quality, the Momentum 3s are perhaps the best choice if you’re focused on sublime sound over everything else. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="df8rra"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="aaY52N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Android Messages update handles Apple iMessage reactions properly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NAXtKbozF3_Upjkdjw3HD7l8kX0=/0x0:975x650/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70176817/IMG_1706.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example emoji reaction in iMessage.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Apple Messages&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q06io8"&gt;An update to Google Messages on Android allows it to properly display emoji reactions sent from the iPhone’s Messages app, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/19/google-messages-imessage-reaction-emoji/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQpmVG"&gt;The update addresses a long-standing issue that occurs when users of Apple’s iMessage service chat with friends using the Messages app on Android. Previously, when an iPhone user reacted to an Android user’s message using an emoji, it appeared as a separate text message when received on Android, often resulting in confusion and lots of unnecessary clutter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68ENREEDia6isDqwUmDxxIuijxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034040/Screenshot_20211122_070026_Messages.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Google Messages&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old method generated a separate message for each reaction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VxUGpmk-yYlelAA1cJ7po9mBe5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034042/translated_from_iphone_reaction_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/19/google-messages-imessage-reaction-emoji/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new approach is much cleaner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oklXEr"&gt;After the update, however, the message flow is a lot simpler. Screenshots posted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; show how the emoji reactions appear attached to the intended text, as though they were sent by another Google Messages user. Tapping on an emoji reaction displays a popup saying that it’s been “Translated from iPhone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5mPqR"&gt;Interestingly, emoji reactions sent from iPhone seem to sometimes appear as different emoji on Android. The heart emoji, for example, reportedly appears as heart-eyes on Android. iPhone users can also retroactively change their emoji reaction, and the change will be reflected seamlessly in the Android app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YktFlU"&gt;The feature doesn’t appear to have widely rolled out just yet, even for users with the latest beta version of the Google Messages app — we tried but were unable to force the emoji reactions to display in our own tests. But when it arrives, it should remove a small point of friction in iPhone to Android communications, even if it’s still a far cry from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;offering iMessage natively on Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXylBo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnj7M1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s ambitious epic takes a while to get going&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5ikwZZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s first season has officially wrapped with its season finale, which saw the first chapter of Apple TV Plus’ most ambitious show come to a conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvLslI"&gt;The epic sci-fi show, based on Isaac Asimov’s centuries-spanning series of novels, has grown far beyond its quasi-magic space math &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;from the initial episodes&lt;/a&gt;, spinning out different storylines ranging from drama in the Foundation’s newfound home of Terminus to the byzantine imperial politics of Trantor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz2Vqu"&gt;In the wake of the finale, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s Chaim Gartenberg and Andrew Webster are revisiting the show to see what worked, what didn’t, and what they’re hoping to see in the already-announced second season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjnbBE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for the entire first season of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8IqBfgNL4xbz_pyw-C_hJVkafWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028213/Foundation_Photo_010904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj4K4l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m really of two minds about &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;. With the first season in the bag, I’m actually really enjoying the show as interesting, high-concept sci-fi. But the story that’s being told here is emphatically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that of &lt;em&gt;Foundation &lt;/em&gt;from the Asimov books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6O35S"&gt;I get that there’s bound to be differences in adapting a seven-book series (not counting the expanded &lt;em&gt;Empire &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Robot&lt;/em&gt; stories that Asimov later tied into a mostly cohesive whole) that was retroactively forged into books out of numerous short stories aiming to tell a story spanning 1,000 years of human history. But even with that said, after borrowing the basic premise — the Empire is going to fall and mankind will suffer 30,000 years of darkness unless something is done to cushion the dark age to 1,000 years, because “fancy math” — &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; just seems wholly uninterested in exploring that concept past the first episode or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oshlRK"&gt;The individual stories here are generally interesting on their own. The “genetic dynasty” of a succession of Lee Paces ruling the crumbling empire with an iron fist is the show’s highlight, thanks in no small part to Pace’s dynamic performances as the cloned Brother Day. And Salvor Hardin’s cat-and-mouse game on Terminus with the Anacreons is enjoyable sci-fi fare, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOpLTS"&gt;Meanwhile, the third leg of the story, the prolonged drama of Gaal’s shuttling in cryo from place to place as the show hints at her mysterious powers, is… less compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOZ3O5"&gt;The practical concerns of running a multi-season TV series also clearly impact the show. Some characters, like the Cleon clones or the seemingly immortal robot Demerzel, play well into the themes of the series and help give weight to the sheer size and scale of the Empire. But by the end of the finale, it felt like the show was twisting itself in knots to keep key characters like Hardin and Gaal around through multiple eras of the show so that the actors playing them could offer some continuity for the next season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMXhWqWlb9w0hdwpkT2LE_X2gdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028228/Foundation_Photo_010605.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8WQURB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m not as well-versed on the source material, but I generally agree. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;Once all of the initial worldbuilding and discussion of future-predicting math was out of the way in the first few episodes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; really picked up in a lot of ways. The worldbuilding remains incredible throughout. All of the many cultures and planets have a depth to them that is quite frankly astounding. That goes for the big things — like a desert planet’s incredibly detailed religious beliefs and ceremonies or the sheer scale of the landscapes you see — to the smaller moments, like the scratches on an old spacesuit or the way each culture has its own particular style of dress and armor. You can tell there was a huge budget here, and it was put to good use. (Even the special effects that seem out of place, like a certain robot skull in the finale, look amazing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyIGrI"&gt;Early on, I really struggled to identify with any of the cast. It was all setup and vanishingly little character development. As the story developed, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s confusing structure continued to make this a struggle. It jumps around &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, both in terms of the stories it’s focused on and the timeline. There’s just so much going on, and so much complexity — Harri Seldon’s plan seemed complicated at first, but the many layers (and lies) it ends up involving made it even harder to follow — that’s only compounded by the fact that many of the characters live years beyond their life span through cryo-sleep or other means. Oh, and then there are the multiple generations of the emperor, all played by the same three actors, making things even harder to follow. It also doesn’t help that the show is far too serious all the time. I get that the fate of the universe is important, but &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; could definitely use a sense of humor to lighten the mood at times and let me connect to its cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6bWJG"&gt;It wasn’t until episode eight, where Lee Pace’s emperor faces a life-threatening trek through a desert, where I felt like I was finally getting to know these characters. Up until then, the show seemed more focused on the universe as a whole than it did the individual people whose stories it’s telling. Once it slowed down, though, and allowed viewers longer and quieter moments with the cast, it really worked. And like you said, even when they don’t have much to work with, much of the cast here does great with what’s in front of them — especially the villains. Pace exudes a cold calculating menace that borders on sociopathic, while Kubbra Sait, as the grand huntress of the planet of Anacreon, is terrifyingly focused on vengeance above all else. Another highlight is T’Nia Miller as a devout religious leader who stands tall against the empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a2qcwQJzcoYaAYwl4ZEjkLBCBFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028233/Foundation_Photo_010802.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5HKnWC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll join you in praising the worldbuilding: &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; always looks incredible, from claustrophobic hallways on a derelict ship to the sweeping salt deserts to the stark stone of Terminus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w31CFZ"&gt;And the slower pace and steadily built-out cast do help flesh out the latter characters a lot more than Gaal, Hari, or Raych get throughout the first two episodes. Salvor’s extended screentime means that we get to know her, the often contentious relationship she has with her parents and the Foundation’s leadership, and her romantic fling with the Han Solo-esque Hugu (Daniel MacPherson, who helps add a much-needed lightness of tone whenever he shows up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPUSIo"&gt;The show also uses the time to raise some thoughts about the idea of religion and faith versus science and human effort, and the blurred lines between them, particularly as Seldin’s elaborate plan is revealed to help establish himself as a mythological figure in the history of the Foundation. It’s these sorts of parallels that &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t quite fully dig into, although hopefully the show will continue to explore those areas in season 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jGujg"&gt;But&lt;em&gt; Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s pace and added filler also has me raising some eyebrows at the show’s future. One of the draws of the original series is how it skips through time, showing snapshots of the fall of the Empire, the rise of the Foundation as a new power, how Seldon’s predictive powers do (and occasionally don’t) manage to foresee the different shifts and changes in the galactic sphere. And on that scale, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; still feels like it’s stuck in the earliest stages of what it could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/et-VS8rNQSXH6RtXgr7eC5TvzOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028249/Foundation_Photo_011004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U0BrNx"&gt;In theory, that could all be part of the plan: showrunner David S. Goyer apparently pitched Apple on eight seasons of the series for a total of 80 episodes, which would justify the occasionally dragged-out pace if (and it’s a big &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; actually gets the time and budget to tell the other 87.5 percent of its story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWbRH1"&gt;And if &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; is going to try to forge forward in telling the story of Seldon’s 1,000-year plan, at some point it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; going to have to leave some of its cast and characters behind to forge ahead in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hJIyFs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, and here’s the thing: &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; really does feel like it’s building toward something interesting. But in these 10 episodes, it hasn’t reached that destination yet. It’s more like an extended prologue than its own story. Much like Hari Seldon’s followers, the show demands a lot of faith from viewers. In season 1, you’re investing 10 hours for the promise of a more interesting story to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just provided the perfect example of why you can’t trust App Store review scores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rFx2DPvClVc8nhdFNYoS9B53oYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168316/acastro_210817_4721_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61EF7S"&gt;You pissed off people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630517/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-dashboard"&gt;by somewhat breaking your app&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re leaving angry reviews. How can you salvage your reputation? Apple just found one incredibly effective way — get listeners to submit &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; reviews by interrupting their podcast experience with an in-app prompt to submit a rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4O5ANy"&gt;That’s how the Apple Podcasts app went from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700805/apple-app-store-built-in-ratings-reviews-stars"&gt;publicly embarrassing&lt;/a&gt; 1.8-star score all the way to 4.6 stars in a little over a month without any actual fixes, as developer and App Store watchdog Kosta Eleftheriou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856187595804676"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s still going up: according to &lt;a href="https://appfigures.com/"&gt;AppFigures data&lt;/a&gt;, the app has been getting thousands of ratings every day since November 9th, with the vast, overwhelming majority of them issuing a 5-star score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iEKI5P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;How did “Apple Podcasts” suddenly go from 1.8 to 4.6 stars? Is Apple manipulating their own app ratings now? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bSAr8sFKqQ"&gt;https://t.co/bSAr8sFKqQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5kJKYd54VP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5kJKYd54VP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856187595804676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLSaop"&gt;The app has made it to 4.7 stars overall as of this writing and is firmly the No. 1 App Store search result for “podcast.” It looks far more desirable to a new user than it might have before. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tJ4l36w1J8cs4Ok4ZBg5j-ulUc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028458/app_figures2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppFigures estimates 6,292 five-star ratings were submitted on November 17th alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DZqFVI"&gt;If you think there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for this, you might be right — it could definitely be that people who bother to submit reviews tend to be angry, and a lot of people who love Apple Podcasts and never bothered to look it up in the App Store (remember, it’s preinstalled!) are finally balancing things out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClRKH5"&gt;But do those people &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; love Apple Podcasts? Because if you really look at the reviews, it seems like some funny business is going on. There are new, positive reviews, but they aren’t reviews of the Apple Podcasts app at all — they’re reviews of podcasts themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="omaoOF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All the new positive reviews appear to be talking about specific podcasts, instead of the app: &lt;a href="https://t.co/HCo7WCcmH3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HCo7WCcmH3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856197393772547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5AtQE"&gt;I kid you not — this is the top review for Apple Podcasts on the App Store: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gjlDWMerX2-r8gik_iK5ynV0kk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028402/apple_podcasts_review.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple deems this the “Most Helpful” review of its Podcasts app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mp9WiE"&gt;Here are a few more of the “Most Recent” reviews of the Apple Podcasts app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2mG2cO"&gt;“Amazing show! Hilarious and well researched,” writes SammyAls, adding, “The dynamic is amazing, and the content is SO needed! Love this.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EjOpm8"&gt;“Mobley has Depth and Insight,” writes xbacksideslider. “Nice to listen to thoughtful and factual podcast. Far from the superficial emotional appeals to envy and self congratulating faux empathy that so dominate popular culture.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gtRf9"&gt;“The table,” says Jkimble6091. “Being a future young millionaire listening to Anthony Oneal keeps me on track during all the ups and downs of life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IdJELO"&gt;I wondered if maybe this was a common confusion with podcast apps, where listeners think they’re reviewing a podcast instead of the app itself. But no, I didn’t see that obvious pattern when I checked reviews for other top podcast apps in the App Store. Almost every review on competing apps was a review of the apps themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="095B9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0pSFJU"&gt;Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s using a new prompt but claims it’s nothing out of the ordinary. “With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review just like most third-party apps — using the standard Rating &amp;amp; Review prompt available to all developers,” wrote an Apple spokesperson who only agreed to comment if they were not named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJppJu"&gt;We weren’t able to track down a copy of the prompt ourselves to confirm when and where it appears or what it looks like — which seems important if people are getting confused — but it is indeed &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ratings-and-reviews/"&gt;a standard feature of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, one you can even turn off if you like under Settings &amp;gt; App Store &amp;gt; In-App Ratings &amp;amp; Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6lQcf"&gt;But intentional or not, standard or not, the problem with star scores is there’s no way to tell whether they’re legitimate. We don’t know if someone pressed a five-star button because they loved the app, or thought they were rating the podcast itself, or just wanted to close the prompt as quickly as possible. We don’t know if Apple is prompting everyone, or just its most dedicated fans, or some other algorithmic subset that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528701/apple-rank-own-app-over-competitor-files-dropbox-wwdc-2017"&gt;just happened to give it an advantage&lt;/a&gt;. Some bad actors reportedly even buy star scores for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;their egregious App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s impossible for most App Store shoppers to tell. We’ve even seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;an iOS app that refuses to open unless you give it a good score&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3UShJ"&gt;These are the reasons why I suggested that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;should lead the industry by killing off star ratings for good&lt;/a&gt;, among other things it could do to prove it puts people ahead of profits in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM5ZQS"&gt;But with Apple Podcasts, the company is using the same broken star score system that uplifts scammers for its own benefit as well. And it’s a crystal clear example of why you can’t trust star scores — because everyone knows this was a 1.8-star app just last month &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/users-despair-at-apple-podcasts-app-after-update/"&gt;with many valid lingering complaints&lt;/a&gt;, and nothing’s fundamentally changed. It’s the exact same app today as it was then. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Self Service Repair program is an opportunity to repair relationships</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r5nDrl"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787144/apple-home-repair-iphone-mac-parts-tools-instructions"&gt;newly announced&lt;/a&gt; Self Service Repair program, set to launch in early 2022, will finally provide individual customers access to genuine Apple OEM parts and manuals for DIY iPhone (and eventually Mac) repairs. Although this program has limitations, and there are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F55370%2Fapple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22787245%2Fapple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many lingering questions&lt;/a&gt; about how it will be implemented, it is an opportunity for Apple to improve relationships with its customers by making repairs easier. If Apple prices the parts right, the program could also be a way for motivated customers to save money on repairs by going DIY while allowing independent repair shops to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47lmru"&gt;Until now, access to factory OEM parts for iPhones and Macs has been restricted to several Apple-blessed places, including Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASP), Apple Stores, and Apple Independent Repair Providers (IRP), a program that allows independent shops to gain access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training guides for common out-of-warranty Mac and iPhone repairs. Apple’s new self-service program — just like the IRP program — is focused only on screen, battery, and camera repairs when it comes to iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVd3Jc"&gt;Apple plans to become the main resource for individuals looking for access to parts and manuals — &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt; “more than 200 individual parts and tools” for iPhone 12 and 13 models early next year. While that number sounds high given that the self-service program will launch with parts for just two models of iPhones, Kevin Purdy, a writer for online repair guide site iFixit, found it believable. Apple, he says, could sell various adhesives, specialty tools, individual screws, custom presses, electrostatic discharge mats, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Illustration of girl at a workbench with various tools preparing to work on a replacement screen for an iPhone 12 or 13 pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1LxDtb991b4UeOa2L-dDyebr2h8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23026632/Apple_Self_Service_Repair_self_service_11172021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This illustration from an Apple press release depicts at least 10 parts and tools for a single repair coming out of one shipping box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xdhzC2"&gt;These parts are already available to Apple service providers, and the prices are pretty high because the devices are so new. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;Apple itself&lt;/a&gt; charges customers $279 to repair the screen of an iPhone 12 or iPhone 13 Pro. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F55370%2Fapple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22787245%2Fapple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to iFixit&lt;/a&gt;, members of Apple’s IRP program pay about $270 to stock up on these screens (nearly the same as what Apple charges for the repair). However, the out-of-pocket cost for IRP members is reduced to $235 if the old part is sent back, according to iFixit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H28ygS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This removes a big barrier for Apple in the path to legislation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LU6wXd"&gt;While Apple says that individuals using the Self Service Repair program will receive a credit back for the old part, it’s not clear how much money you can save by taking this path, and Apple didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on the matter. In my experience as a former employee of Apple, I recall that it was also Apple Store policy to not allow customers to take back old parts from the repairs we did for them (including bad hard drives from Macs). Based on how important bad part returns seem to Apple, whatever credit Apple will offer to customers using the self-service program could be significant enough to motivate old part returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNAiXp"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/11/21/2578547/former-apple-retail-ron-johnson-interview"&gt;Ron Johnson era&lt;/a&gt; of Apple retail, I worked as a Genius repairing many Macs and early-model iPhones in an Apple retail store. While many of the repairs were expensive on paper, our employee training specifically taught us to provide some repairs for free to promote customer satisfaction, as long as devices didn’t show signs of abuse. Those policies tightened noticeably after Johnson’s departure in 2011, with John Browett taking over as SVP of Apple retail and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/no-surprise-browetts-reign-over-apple-retail-a-short-7-months/"&gt;focusing on cutting costs&lt;/a&gt;. That same year, Apple also introduced the AppleCare Plus service plan add-on for iPhones, in which accidental damage is covered after paying a $49 service fee. Despite the changes, other former employees &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/tech/apple-retail-store-trick-free-repair-replacement-tiktok-video/"&gt;have talked about how Apple’s push to “surprise and delight”&lt;/a&gt; customers can still lead to customers getting free in-store repairs. Whether that will change in the era of self-service is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4V0ePk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hope is that this will be enough to empower more DIY&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NLm56z"&gt;Normally, you could save money by buying aftermarket parts, but right now, aftermarket OLED screens for an iPhone 12 range from $279.99 (iFixit) for just the part to $329.99 (Amazon) for a full kit, which is a heavy cost. Going aftermarket also adds the risk that quality might not be as good as factory OEM pieces, and some parts could lose functionality, such as Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11256118/apple-new-ipad-price-specs-release-date"&gt;True Tone adaptive screen feature&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, customers could save money via Self Service Repair if Apple priced the parts comparable to what IRPs currently pay. However, then IRPs would lose out on business unless Apple offered them a further discount on parts compared with the self-service program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptnIVc"&gt;Another potential way individuals might use the self-service program is to stock up on parts like independent shops in the IRP program can do. Apple might choose to differentiate the IRP program and the Self Service Repair program by not allowing individuals to stock up, however, making it harder for DIY folks trying to plan ahead for devices they’ll want to repair in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KJXvsb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfjWDQOMQdU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2RSETV"&gt;In general, it’s going to be people with older phones who are more likely to need a repair, and right now, Apple’s Self Service Repair program won’t help them. iFixit CEO&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kyle Wiens notes that replacement batteries aren’t necessary for most customers until about a year and a half after the phone was purchased, when battery cells start depleting. While Wiens is overall excited about Apple’s announcement and direction, he believes that the self-service program is primarily Apple’s strategy for getting out in front of potential &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;regulatory action from FTC &lt;/a&gt;and even pressure from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787336/apple-right-to-repair-self-service-diy-reason-microsoft"&gt;its own shareholders over the right to repair&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has also been under scrutiny &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348240/apple-right-to-repair-legislation-antitrust-investigation-policy"&gt;from lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; over its restrictive repair practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pjIGB"&gt;Despite its limitations, there is hope that Apple’s new program will empower more DIY repair folks and perhaps give an opportunity to save some cash. And if a customer gets cold feet when the kit arrives, they might have another option: taking it to a local repair shop that doesn’t have access to genuine Apple parts. That shop could then charge a small fee and do the repair for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for a great Apple deal this Black Friday season, you shouldn’t shop at Apple. That’s because Apple doesn’t typically offer discounts on its new products in-store or on its website, at least outside of the occasional educational discount. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Even better, these retailers have already started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if you’re looking to save even more, make sure to check out our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re highlighting the best deals across all brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DpLcAU"&gt;The third-gen AirPods were released just last month, and now you can buy them with one of their first discounts. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422%3Fathcpid%3D510546422%26athpgid%3DAthenaHomepageDesktop__gm__1.0%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3DSeasonalCampaigns_6fe92024-377d-4272-8406-8e51842e092f_items%26athieid%3Dnull%26athstid%3DCS020%26athguid%3D2_N6KcuypFy6YyBudpQEi5znMGyVPE382o95%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are selling the true wireless earbuds for $175 instead of $179. The latest AirPods boast a MagSafe-ready charging case and shorter stems, as well as better battery life and water resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lLCckh"&gt;Apple’s second generation of true wireless earbuds, the AirPods, are selling for $119 instead of $159 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This particular model comes with a wired charging case, however, you can pick up a pair with the wireless charging case for $160 instead of $200 from &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F482532021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VqyOya"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro comes with Apple’s A12Z processor, a 120Hz display, quad speakers, and a dual-camera system with lidar. Right now, both the 11- and 12.9-inch models are on sale. Best Buy, for example, is selling the 128GB $1,149.99 LTE model of the larger version for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1P6NNP9u7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,049.99&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, you can save significantly more if you’re okay purchasing the smaller, Wi-Fi-only model — but with 265GB storage — for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1P7lnfGaJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $899.99 from Best Buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nAbiSM"&gt;The 64GB, Wi-Fi version of the 10.9-inch iPad Air is selling for $539 instead of $600 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F149437127&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in rose gold, while the space gray version is just $10 extra. Released in 2020, the latest model offers thinner bezels around the display and a Touch ID sensor embedded in the power button. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;div id="x4aA8b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RVzOFA"&gt;Last year’s M1-equipped MacBook Air is, in our opinion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best laptop&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. Right now, you can buy Apple’s entry-level laptop for $949 instead of $999 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5KWB9H?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; when you choose the gold configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Alternatively, the 512GB model with 16GB of RAM is selling for $1,349 in gold or space gray at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604840-REG%2Fapple_z125_mgn7_04_bh_13_3_macbook_air_with.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x1080441%2FSID%2Fprice-guide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22787892%2Fapple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ULdok1"&gt;Last year’s 27-inch iMac comes with an improved 1080p webcam, as well as a notable performance increase over its predecessor. Right now, you can pick it up for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Retina-Display-27-inch-Storage/dp/B08F8ZPRGW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,699&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,799 when you choose the Core i5 model with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356416/apple-imac-27-2020-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;div id="WcbOv3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873326"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="title"&gt;Amazon is discounting various configurations of the already affordable Apple Watch SE by around $10, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling this 40mm, GPS-equipped model&lt;/a&gt; for $270 instead of $279. While a small discount, this smartwatch is a great low-cost alternative we think you should choose over the Series 3, as it has most of the features found on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17875882/new-apple-watch-series-4-review-ekg-bands-screen-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series 4&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="4UnRx1"&gt;The first-gen Apple Pencil is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MK0C2AM-A-Apple-Pencil/dp/B016NY7784/ref=asc_df_B016NY7784/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $80&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date. The stylus is compatible with the latest entry-level iPad and a range of earlier models, and it differs from the second-gen model in that you need to plug it into your iPad’s Lightning port in order to charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p id="2g6QKI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSqILT"&gt;We’ve got a well-rounded episode of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;today with everything from policy to space to consumer tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9RmQE"&gt;In the first segment, Nilay and Dieter bring in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; policy reporter Makena Kelly to talk about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;President Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure package&lt;/a&gt; and what it can do to improve broadband access in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huCavM"&gt;In segment two, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior science reporter Loren Grush joins the show to explain why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782946/russia-asat-test-satellite-international-space-station-debris"&gt;Russia destroyed one of their own satellites with a ground-based missile&lt;/a&gt; and how it’s causing concern in the space community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avvsQr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Managing editor Alex Cranz stops by in segment three to chat about Apple announcing that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787144/apple-home-repair-iphone-mac-parts-tools-instructions"&gt;will start selling manuals and tools&lt;/a&gt; for repairing certain iPhone and Mac products at home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees will return to offices February 1st in a hybrid work pilot</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cmtF4x"&gt;Apple employees will return to offices starting February 1st as part of a hybrid work pilot and will be able to work remotely for four weeks a year. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/apple-sets-feb-1-for-return-to-office"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, employees learned of the news Thursday via an internal memo from CEO Tim Cook. The company had previously offered two weeks of remote work per year but added two more weeks to give “more opportunity to travel, be closer to your loved ones, or simply shake up your routines,” Cook’s memo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPbyzN"&gt;The pilot will start workers at one or two days in the office, then in March, workers will come to the office to work on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. They’ll be able to work from home on Wednesdays and Fridays. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-pushes-back-return-office-plan-february-rcna6026"&gt;Some employees may be asked&lt;/a&gt; to come into the office four or five days a week if their roles require more time in the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyCOxO"&gt;Cook first announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;hybrid work model in June&lt;/a&gt;, when the company was planning a September return to offices that was moved back to October, then January, and now, to February. Some Apple employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;pushed back strongly against the hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;, writing in an internal letter to Cook that they wanted a more flexible policy that allowed anyone who wanted to work from home to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzcW1d"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for more details on the company’s office return. Following widespread closures of Apple stores during the height of the pandemic in 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;reopened its retail stores&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, with mask requirements in place. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants to launch a self-driving EV in 2025 with a custom chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FVtbo2763oZyprM7_3rrzX2D04=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160939/acstro_190902_apple_event_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7XrPj"&gt;Apple has completed “much of the core work” on a new processor meant to power its secretive autonomous electric car project known as Titan, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt;. The milestone comes as Apple is reportedly now accelerating its timeline for the autonomous car it’s developing, with a new target of launching it in just four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ynw50V"&gt;Apple’s own silicon team designed the chip, which Gurman says is the “most advanced component” that’s been developed for the project so far. The company is apparently getting ready to put the chip through its real-world paces in its fleet of test vehicles in California and hopes to make a vehicle with “stronger safeguards than what’s available from Tesla and Waymo,” according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz0Qx5"&gt;The goal now for Project Titan, after multiple pivots, is to create an autonomous car that does not have a steering wheel. The interior would be spacious and look more like the limousine-style seating arrangement that EV startup Canoo has promoted in its electric van prototypes. Apple was at one point in talks to acquire Canoo, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;recently hired one of the startup’s co-founders&lt;/a&gt;. There would be a large, iPad-style touchscreen display that will run a user interface similar to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPgvES"&gt;The business model is reportedly still undecided, though. Apple has considered trying to create a self-driving fleet to compete with Uber, Lyft, and Waymo (something Tesla has proposed but is still very far from executing), but Gurman reports that the “more likely scenario” is that Apple will sell the cars to individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZlkdE"&gt;On the electric vehicle side of things, Apple is reportedly not looking to develop a proprietary charging cable for the car. Instead, it wants to make the vehicle compatible with the “combined charging system,” or CCS standard, which would make it possible to charge the vehicle at most public fast charging stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib1zFC"&gt;Of course, all of this comes after years of reported changes to the project, which was started in 2014. Five different executives have run Project Titan after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;Apple Watch lead Kevin Lynch took over earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The refocusing and timeline shift reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; could be a sign that there’s real progress being made with him at the helm, or it could just become the newest footnote in whatever the project turns into next.&lt;/p&gt;
