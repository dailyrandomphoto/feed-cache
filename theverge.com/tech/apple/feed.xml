    <title>Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pros will reportedly bring back the SD card slot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display 2015" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8U4fJCiw3vwAPazZYBy2f1EbU0=/0x0:1016x677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68705924/oo04-09_1247tt.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vXsdDT"&gt;Apple may finally be bringing an integrated SD card slot to its upcoming 2021 models of its MacBook Pro laptops, according to a new report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot?sref=kKj7hWAI&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, in a move that would restore the popular port standard to the company’s computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVEfNJ"&gt;The MacBook Pro lineup hasn’t offered an SD card slot since Apple removed the feature in its 2016 redesign, which excised all the ports from the laptops in favor of four universal USB-C ports. This forced many professional users — who rely on the popular memory card format to import photos and videos to their computers for editing — to turn to much-reviled dongles to get the same functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAP3av"&gt;The news comes after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;earlier report&lt;/a&gt; from Gurman that originally detailed some of the changes that Apple was planning for the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch designs. These changes include removing the controversial Touch Bar interface in exchange for physical function keys; offering a more squared-off design that’s in line with the recent iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPhone 12 lineups; adding brighter displays; and bringing back Apple’s magnetic MagSafe chargers. That’s all in addition to the biggest change, which will see the high-end laptops move from Intel’s processors to a more powerful version of Apple’s in-house, ARM-based M1 chipset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vREWBe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"2021 MacBook Pro will ditch the Touch Bar and bring back MagSafe, say reports","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"},{"title":"Apple reportedly planning new MacBook Air design with MagSafe charging","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="weImFK"&gt;Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo corroborated those reports by claiming that the new laptops would offer additional ports, but today marks the first confirmation of the SD card slot specifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfF7Bc"&gt;The news of the SD card slot’s return actually comes as an aside in a larger report on Apple’s planned refresh for a “high-end” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;MacBook Air model&lt;/a&gt;, which is said to offer similar MagSafe and processor benefits as the new MacBook Pros. Unfortunately, though, there’s no mention of the SD card slot being offered on the upcoming Air refresh — just a pair of USB-C ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwyZTq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3ZuUA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-892" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6-IseMU-VKzo5xzTTBT8BVk65z1R7t_lZHR-ApDuYug7wocNVuNr-RoCuiUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. Currently, the lowest price is $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6z1zgThWDp2tf3j60kOubPIybm5uNl4EBzedCsO2Rm4cjFVJV1QJbxoCUaAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you want the lowest price for these wireless earbuds and don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a new pair, the lowest price currently available is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-22?ref=mwj_cd_deal_8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$205 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$209 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s DeathAdder V2 Pro wireless gaming mouse just got its first big price cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tJCuS69yYlt9KF75D0wTm5xMkIY=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68705173/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_h22_hc4_9086248124446_deathadderV2pro_gallery_1500x1000_img2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j3JQCV"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 wired gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;one of the best wired gaming mice you can buy right now&lt;/a&gt;, according to my colleague Cameron Faulkner. But if you are trying to minimize the number of cables on your desk, the DeathAdder V2 Pro is a nice wireless alternative — and it’s down to $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Gaming-Mouse-Programmable/dp/B08FQMBKQG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5062c6215cf5ff9fc9d97360e8b5047d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730147301464983468" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gMltV"&gt;The DeathAdder V2 Pro is a lightweight mouse weighing in at 88 grams, six grams heavier than its wired variant. It has the same support for five onboard profiles and the same 20K optical sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s7bmwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDBGio"&gt;If you don’t mind wired gaming mice and you are on a budget, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Viper-Ultralight-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B084RPZD6T/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=454c32c001a53e36c40f324f24ec24dd&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730147565467715283" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have also discounted the Razer Viper Mini, bringing it down to just $20. It’s a miniature rehash of Razer’s Viper gaming mouse. It can last for up to 50 million clicks, can handle up to 8,500 DPI sensitivity, and has six programmable buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ymYrPN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10297311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14JBAd"&gt;Apple’s flagship wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are considered worthy of their $249 price tag. However, there are a few deals going on right now. First, you can get a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729136281790037757" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Geek Squad Certified refurbished pair for $200 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, if you prefer buying a new pair, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-22?ref=mwj_cd_deal_8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot currently has the AirPods Pro for $205&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. It’s not the lowest price we have seen a new pair of these earbuds go for, but it is the best price currently available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z9uMA5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxnuBn"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new smartphone that has a superb camera, but you don’t want to spend a ton of money, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615542-REG%2Fgoogle_ga1296_us_pixel_3_xl_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F22%2F22244069%2Frazer-deathadder-v2-pro-wireless-gaming-mouse-airpods-pros-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H still has an incredible deal&lt;/a&gt; on a 64GB unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL. Although this phone is almost three years old, it does come equipped with Android 11 OS and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;will also receive Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, which is coming later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QUN2SW"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a new design for its MacBook Air that will include the return of MagSafe charging. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot?sref=kKj7hWAI&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the updated MacBook Air may appear later this year or in 2022, and is designed to be thinner and lighter than the existing model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yue8s1"&gt;Apple may make the MacBook Air smaller thanks to reduced bezels on the 13-inch screen, and will reportedly include two USB 4 ports on the laptop. Apple is also likely to include the next generation of its ARM-based processors inside this new MacBook Air, after introducing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 on the existing MacBook Air in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old MagSafe charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I2Umeo"&gt;Apple’s magnetic charging system, MagSafe, is also supposed to return with this MacBook Air redesign. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-macbook-pros-with-magsafe-return-in-the-works"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the updated MagSafe for the MacBook Pro will be similar to the old pill-shaped design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxLIGF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also notes that Apple did consider a larger 15-inch version of the MacBook Air, but has scrapped those plans. This new MacBook Air design is reportedly a “higher-end version” of the existing laptop, and Apple is expected to continue selling the M1 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYY9YJ"&gt;Rumors of a new MacBook Air design come just a week after TF International Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;Apple is also planning a major MacBook Pro redesign&lt;/a&gt; with squared-off sides like the iPad Pro. Apple is also rumored to be bringing back its MagSafe magnetic charging connector to the MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pebble founder promises iMessage on Android and Windows with universal chat app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1wZFTB046HpKA-ZWB_QfputIBo=/0x0:1715x1143/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698998/msedge_cx5MYIw6nR.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beeper’s website promises “a single app to chat on iMessage, WhatsApp, and 13 other networks.”&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: BeeperHQ.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vJaaDX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.beeperhq.com/"&gt;Beeper&lt;/a&gt; is a new universal chat app that’s an attempt to unify 15 different chat platforms into a single interface. The app is the work of a team that includes Eric Migicovsky, the CEO and founder of former smartwatch manufacturer Pebble, who announced its launch on Twitter. Beeper’s site notes that the project was previously known as NovaChat, and requires a $10 per month subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3OMhW"&gt;Although Beeper integrates with world’s most popular messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Slack, Twitter, Discord, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger, it’s the support for Apple’s iMessage that’s perhaps most interesting. iMessage is only officially available on Apple devices, and it’s often cited by users as something that prevents them switching to Android. Migicovsky says Beeper should allow iMessage to work on Android, Windows, and Linux, but admits that it’s “using some trickery” in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7mXgX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And yes, iMessage works even on Android, Windows and Linux using some trickery :)&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1351932357201154048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glUzzv"&gt;An FAQ on Beeper’s website gives a more in-depth explanation of exactly what this trickery involves. If you’ve got an always-online Mac, then you can install the Beeper Mac app to act as a bridge, similar to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/02/imessages-on-android/"&gt;the approach AirMessage uses&lt;/a&gt;. But things get really wild if you don’t have access to a Mac, at which point Beeper says it’ll literally send each of its users a “Jailbroken iPhone with the Beeper app installed” in order to act as a bridge. At this point we should probably mention that using Beeper involves paying a $10 a month subscription, which may or may not include the cost of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5nS9e"&gt;Just in case you thought Beeper was joking, in a followup tweet, Migicovsky said that he currently has 50 old iPhone 4S’s at his desk, ready to be upcycled for use with Beeper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DZqpVf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fQ960gU7Xm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fQ960gU7Xm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1351936829017083906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zcLez"&gt;If the workaround works as Beeper claims, then the result should be a universal chat app that works across MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android, offering a unified inbox, and the ability to search across messages from each of the 15 services. It’s built on the open source Matrix messaging protocol (Migicovsky &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad#315f:~:text=The%20only%20downside%20to%20Matrix%20is,the%20waiting%20list%20to%20use%20it."&gt;previously described&lt;/a&gt; NovaChat’s relationship to Matrix as akin to Gmail’s relationship with email), and although the client app itself isn’t open source, the bridges connecting it to other chat services are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbZT0G"&gt;Oh, and there’s a dark mode coming in Beeper’s next update, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3taZS3X_tQWFDqp5nn7mbulfSZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249728/6006a93e8082353374b0cd22_beeperSearch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeper&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beeper’s interface can include chats from multiple different services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W4JSXX"&gt;While the short-term aim is to make it easier to chat to people across different chat apps, eventually Migicovsky has talked about the prospect of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad#e362:~:text=These%20bridges%20are%20actually%20just%20an,need%20for%20bridges%20gradually%20over%20time."&gt;everyone using Matrix itself&lt;/a&gt; to chat with friends and colleagues, rather than simply using it as a bridge between services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOpjih"&gt;Although Migicovsky says he’s been using Beeper as his default chat client for the past two years, it doesn’t appear to be widely available just yet. Instead, Beeper asks prospective users to fill out a form on its website for an invitation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpXTUd"&gt;Here’s the full list of chat services that Beeper currently supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WXWYqb"&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qxrw5I"&gt;Facebook Messenger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vQZ1eg"&gt;iMessage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Phn8Xh"&gt;Android Messages (SMS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wa0ikm"&gt;Telegram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5dL2i7"&gt;Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZnJXG"&gt;Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XyQ9da"&gt;Hangouts&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="aDk10y"&gt;Skype&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="4GZTjq"&gt;Matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kKCCjk"&gt;Discord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vIljWB"&gt;Signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KSr2xk"&gt;Beeper network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Apple’s first VR headset reportedly includes a fabric design, a fan, and expensive price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--mchtKKykT_pIeLMrTf_7Q5150=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698961/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IZTva7"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a VR headset that will include a fabric design, a fan, and an expensive price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s first VR headset may launch as soon as 2022 as a standalone device that operates through batteries, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is reportedly working on “some of its most advanced and powerful chips” for this unannounced VR headset, with some chips reportedly beating its own M1 Mac processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjaoPC"&gt;Apple has reportedly faced challenges in the development of this headset, with some prototypes ending up too big and heavy. Apple is reportedly using a fabric exterior to reduce the headset weight, but the company is also using a fan — an unusual move for Apple given its emphasis on fan-less design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6dJgivAt5zzei_su0CSzE_T_Fk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21869421/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tii31X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the size of Apple’s VR headset, which is codenamed N301, is similar to the Oculus Quest, and some prototypes being tested include external cameras to enable some AR features. Apple is also reportedly testing the ability to use these cameras to track hand movements, and include software features like a virtual keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tT2Mk"&gt;It’s not clear exactly when Apple’s VR headset will launch, but it could be as soon as 2022. It will reportedly be an expensive and niche device, with some at Apple rumored to be anticipating that the company may sell only one headset per day at each of its retail stores, or less than 200,000 units per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frWB0X"&gt;Apple has been working on VR and AR headsets for years, according to various reports. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296674/apple-vr-ar-headset-glasses-external-hub-jony-ive-bloomberg-go-read-this"&gt;detailed look at Apple’s VR and AR ambitions&lt;/a&gt; last year, noting that the company has around 1,000 people working on AR and VR.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Linux has been ported to run on Apple’s M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-IpwDW3GHZj5o-3J6zhfJoB6t0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698905/vpavic_4291_20201113_0326.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tKNyW"&gt;A new Linux port allows Apple’s M1 Macs to run Ubuntu for the first time. Corellium, a security firm that offers a virtualized version of iOS for security testing, has successfully ported Ubuntu over to M1 Macs and released a tutorial for others to follow. The modified version of Ubuntu boots into the regular user interface and includes USB support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yav1NU"&gt;The team at Corellium have &lt;a href="https://corellium.com/blog/linux-m1"&gt;detailed exactly how&lt;/a&gt; they managed to get Ubuntu running, and it’s a good in-depth read if you’re interested in the details. While a number of M1 components are shared with Apple’s mobile chips, the non-standard chips made it challenging to create Linux drivers to get Ubuntu running properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtsFHk"&gt;Apple hasn’t designed its M1 Macs with dual-boot or Boot Camp in mind. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp"&gt;has previously ruled out official support&lt;/a&gt; for natively booting alternate operating systems like Windows or Linux. Virtualization seems to be Apple’s preferred method, but that hasn’t stopped people from making their own ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eFKgh1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Linux is now completely usable on the Mac mini M1. Booting from USB a full Ubuntu desktop (rpi). Network works via a USB c dongle. Update includes support for USB, I2C, DART. We will push changes to our GitHub and a tutorial later today. Thanks to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CorelliumHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CorelliumHQ&lt;/a&gt; team ❤️  &lt;a href="https://t.co/uBDbDmvJUG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uBDbDmvJUG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Wade (@cmwdotme) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1351838924621099008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v56Gaz"&gt;Hector Martin, a developer who regularly gets Linux running on a variety of hardware, is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1333459867323957251?s=21"&gt;also porting Linux to M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt;. Developers seem to be enticed by the performance benefits offered by Apple’s M1 chips, and the ability to run Linux on a silent ARM-based machine. “I’ve been waiting for an ARM laptop that can run Linux for a &lt;em&gt;long &lt;/em&gt;time,” said Linux creator Linus Torvalds &lt;a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=196533&amp;amp;curpostid=196570"&gt;back in November&lt;/a&gt;. “The new Air would be almost perfect, except for the OS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz7P96"&gt;Corellium CTO Chris Wade describes this new port as “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1351838924621099008"&gt;completely usable&lt;/a&gt;” on a Mac Mini M1, and it works by booting the full Ubuntu desktop from USB. You will need a USB-C dongle to get networking working, though, and the process to get the port running will require some familiarity with Linux and custom kernels. Corellium has posted a &lt;a href="https://corellium.com/blog/linux-m1"&gt;tutorial on the process&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in trying this beta project out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmANmX"&gt;Corellium has some experience in working around Apple’s operating system protections. Corellium offers security researchers a virtual iPhone to help with vulnerability exploration. It’s a process that has angered Apple enough to file lawsuits against Corellium. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205130/apple-corellium-dismissed-copyright-dmca-fair-use"&gt;Apple lost an early challenge&lt;/a&gt; against Corellium late last year, after initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20809109/apple-corellium-startup-company-lawsuit-court-virtual-iphone-software-copy"&gt;filing a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the company on copyright grounds back in August 2019. Apple later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047275/apple-corellium-dmca-lawsuit-copyright-research-jailbreak-security-copyright"&gt;alleged DMCA violations&lt;/a&gt; in January 2020, and a judge dismissed the copyright infringement claims in December. A ruling on the separate DMCA allegations has been deferred.&lt;/p&gt;

He also gave him a $5,999 Mac Pro, according to Donald Trump’s final financial disclosure report today (via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidenrich/status/1352055331376025601"&gt;the NY Times’ David Enrich&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bSjHr"&gt;The computer is described as the very first Mac Pro produced at the Flex Factory in Austin, Texas. That’s also a lie: that factory has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/21/14037030/apple-made-in-america-failure"&gt;actually been producing Mac Pros since 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tech rallies behind Biden’s immigration plans</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="waLAnO"&gt;Hours after taking his oath of office on Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed several executive orders overturning actions taken by the Trump administration regarding immigration, and tech is rallying behind the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RhLor"&gt;Biden signed two executive orders Wednesday that extend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for another four years and overturn the Trump administration’s travel bans on largely Muslim-majority countries. It’s just the start of the Biden administration’s immigration reform efforts. The administration also plans to drop a new bill that would &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/15/biden-immigration-plans-459766"&gt;provide 11 million undocumented immigrants&lt;/a&gt; with a pathway to citizenship and an eight-year waiting period before they can become permanent residents, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/15/biden-immigration-plans-459766"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="653IWB"&gt;“We welcome President Biden’s commitment to pursuing comprehensive immigration reform that reflects the American values of justice, fairness and dignity. This effort will strengthen American communities and the pathways to opportunity this country has long fostered,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement Wednesday. “In the weeks and months to come, business leaders look forward to working with the Administration, as well as Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to achieve bipartisan, practical and comprehensive solutions to fix our broken immigration system, including a permanent solution for Dreamers that includes a path to citizenship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5bPgBZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We applaud &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@POTUS&lt;/a&gt;'s quick action on COVID relief, the Paris Climate Accord, and immigration reform. Google has supported action on these important issues &amp;amp; we look forward to working with the new administration to help the US recover from the pandemic + grow our economy.&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1352021111479832576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UChP9a"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai also put out a statement in support of the Biden administration’s new immigration effort. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;We applaud @POTUS‘s quick action on COVID relief, the Paris Climate Accord, and immigration reform. Google has supported action on these important issues &amp;amp; we look forward to working with the new administration to help the US recover from the pandemic + grow our economy,” Pichai said in a tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDj5rB"&gt;“We are thankful that President Biden and Vice President Harris are following through on their commitment to send a bill to Congress to fix our broken immigration system,” FWD.us president Todd Schulte said in a statement Wednesday. “What needs to happen in short order is the House and Senate must move legislation that is signed into law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAtYuB"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg helped found FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization, in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vi3cbH"&gt;Twitter also put out a statement in support of the move. The “DACA Executive Order signed this evening delivers hope for #Dreamers. Diversity makes the US, our company, and our world better,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1352024397591289856?s=20"&gt;the company said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzWMLD"&gt;Last summer, former President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending a number of visa programs, including guest worker visas, like the H-1B. Tech companies commonly use these visas to recruit talented employees from overseas. After this proclamation was issued, tech companies, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300573/h1b-visa-ban-tim-cook-twitter-donald-trump-statement"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299812/trump-guest-worker-h1-b-visa-google-tech-itic-internet-association"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, put out statements admonishing the Trump administration’s guest worker ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8At6mr"&gt;In the past, tech companies have argued that comprehensive immigration reform would benefit the US economy, largely focusing on how to improve visas for the high-skilled workers these companies employ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0yax"&gt;TechNet, a technology trade group, signed onto a National Immigration Forum &lt;a href="https://immigrationforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Statement-in-Support-of-Bipartisan-Immigration-Reform-1_19_2021.pdf"&gt;letter to Congress&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday encouraging members to quickly approve the Biden administration’s immigration plans. Dozens of TechNet’s members also signed onto the letter, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCjP9B"&gt;“We can create a modern, humane, and effective immigration system that upholds the best of America’s promise: to be a nation where people can come from around the world to work, contribute, and build a better life for themselves, their families, and our society as a whole,” the TechNet letter said. “As we recover from COVID-19, the essential contributions of immigrants here today, and those to come tomorrow, will be critical to the health and well-being of American workers and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdb2QT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXBsap"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some M1 Mac users reporting screensaver takeover bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7vtFS1TG21JsZ2cPzfJfdtmqSI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68689511/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zx4UVA"&gt;I picked up a new MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 chip, and I’ve absolutely loved it so far. It’s really speedy and the battery is fantastic. But I’ve been dealing with one nagging issue. Every once in a while, for reasons that I haven’t been able to figure out, a screensaver will suddenly take over the entire computer — despite the fact that I never use a screensaver. And frustratingly, the screensaver renders my laptop inoperable until I completely close the screen and reopen it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cf8SGP"&gt;It seems I’m not the only one seeing this bug, according to this &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/18/m1-macs-fast-user-switching-screensaver-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;. Others have shared similar issues with M1-equipped MacBook Airs, Pros, and Minis on &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/screensaver-activates-randomly-m1-air.2270873/?post=29296369#post-29296369"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-is-going-on-here-screensaver-like-animation-spontaneously-appears-video.2273013/?post=29338930#post-29338930"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;, Reddit (in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/kj4ova/big_sur_screensaver_bug/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/k3mmwt/macbook_air_m1_2020_display_issue_screen_show_sup/"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/k18gih/has_anyone_ever_seen_this_it_just_recently/"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt;), and Apple’s &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252083925?page=1"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252087996"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;. And one user on &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; said they’ve &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-m1-macs-affected-by-fast-user-switching-screensaver-bug.2280806/?post=29517694#post-29517694"&gt;seen the bug&lt;/a&gt; on their 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has an Intel chip, so perhaps this is a problem with macOS Big Sur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd35WL"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/N3CoMocJ7Rw"&gt;a video of the bug&lt;/a&gt;, shared by &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/screensaver-activates-randomly-m1-air.2270873/?post=29307255#post-29307255"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; forum member dawideksl&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nxY9gQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3CoMocJ7Rw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B36v0c"&gt;Many people reporting the issue in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/kj4ova/big_sur_screensaver_bug/"&gt;this Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; say they have multiple accounts on the same computer. And for what it’s worth, I’ve set up two accounts on my MacBook Air. One user on Apple’s &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252087996?answerId=254255624022#254255624022"&gt;support forums&lt;/a&gt; disabled Fast User Switching and said they weren’t seeing the screensaver, so perhaps that’s a workaround until Apple addresses the bug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9p3vO"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJ350W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
