    <title>You can now migrate your WhatsApp chats from an iPhone to a new Samsung phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TQ1K7xDsu71yj2_HYK5NjBKHpY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813645/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJavqa"&gt;WhatsApp has added the ability for users to migrate their chat history when switching from iOS to Samsung Android devices, the company said in a blog post. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619664/whatsapp-android-ios-chat-history-transfer-cross-platform"&gt;Samsung announced&lt;/a&gt; the feature was coming during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617405/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-biggest-announcements-z-flip-z-fold-3-watch-buds-note"&gt;August Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;, and addresses one of the more frustrating features — or lack of— of WhatsApp on mobile devices. Previously, if users selected WhatsApp’s cloud backup feature, then iOS chat histories were stored in iCloud, while Android’s histories backed up to Google Drive, making it almost impossible to transfer chats between phones that weren’t running the same operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PdA5ieES-HJwx6ys2wl3zsTImLk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775559/Cross_Platform_Switch_UI__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: WhatsApp&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0DrVEe"&gt;There are a few caveats WhatsApp outlines in its blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FCwuEr"&gt;If you’re moving from an iPhone to a Samsung Android device, you can transfer your account information, profile photo, individual chats, group chats, chat history, media and settings. You can’t transfer your call history or display name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hHXRhx"&gt;In addition, you can only do the migration during initial setup of your new Samsung device, as the instructions from WhatsApp say that “your new Android device must be factory new or reset to factory settings” to allow the migration, so users would have to do a complete factory reset of their Samsung device if it is already operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OjsaE"&gt;The old iPhone needs to have WhatsApp iOS version 2.21.160.17 or newer and the new Samsung phone has to have WhatsApp Android version 2.21.16.20 or newer. The new device needs to have the Samsung SmartSwitch app version 3.7.22.1 or newer installed. The transfer takes place via a USB-C to Lightning cable, so you’ll need one of those as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYwrkO"&gt;Here are the steps to conduct the transfer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="g6OV8z"&gt;How to migrate WhatsApp chats from an iPhone to a new Samsung device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="0ASdU2"&gt;Turn on your Samsung and connect by cable to your iPhone when prompted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c79xLj"&gt;Follow the Samsung Smart Switch instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OKC1rK"&gt;When prompted, scan the QR code displayed on the new Samsung device using the iPhone’s camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6jrAH1"&gt;Tap Start on your iPhone, and wait for the process to complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uzUnLN"&gt;Continue setting up your new Samsung device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wsVryK"&gt;When you reach the home screen, open WhatsApp and log in using the same phone number used on your old device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Izn4eU"&gt;Tap Import when prompted, and allow the process to complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3s2QN2"&gt;Finish activating your new device. Your WhatsApp chats should now be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="WBQNcl"&gt;After you complete the migration, your old iPhone will still have your data on it unless you delete WhatsApp or wipe the device completely. The transferred data doesn’t go to cloud storage after the migration, and WhatsApp says it can’t see the data you transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7HiHS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1ZlNz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays controversial child protection features after privacy outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VwPB_bhwTp-Vi8kMOGMoIFLiXRQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813219/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple delays controversial child protection features | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oJ8tHn"&gt;Apple is delaying its child protection features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;announced last month&lt;/a&gt;, including a controversial feature that would scan users’ photos for child sexual abuse material (CSAM), following intense criticism that the changes could diminish user privacy. The changes had been scheduled to roll out later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNAUVa"&gt;“Last month we announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material,” Apple said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mgbHgI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a major reversal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt0z5g"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;original press release&lt;/a&gt; about the changes, which were intended to reduce the proliferation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), has a similar statement at the top of the page. That release detailed three major changes in the works. One change to Search and Siri would point to resources to prevent CSAM if a user searched for information related it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mM9y14"&gt;The other two changes came under more significant scrutiny. One would alert parents when their kids were receiving or sending sexually explicit photos and would blur those images for kids. The other would have scanned images stored in a user’s iCloud Photos for CSAM and report them to Apple moderators, who could then refer the reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XFARfH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="krYwm4"&gt;Apple detailed the iCloud Photo scanning system at length to make the case that it didn’t weaken user privacy. In short, it scanned photos stored in iCloud Photos on your iOS device and would assess those photos alongside a database of known CSAM image hashes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623859/apple-icloud-photos-csam-scanning-security-multiple-jurisdictions-safeguard"&gt;NCMEC and other child safety organizations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0qN8B"&gt;Still, many privacy and security experts heavily criticized the company for the new system, arguing that it could have created an on-device surveillance system and that it violated the trust users had put in Apple for protecting on-device privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EE6CaL"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation said in an August 5th &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that the new system, however well-intended, would “break key promises of the messenger’s encryption itself and open the door to broader abuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNKXWe"&gt;“Apple is compromising the phone that you and I own and operate,” said &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/apples-mistake/"&gt;Ben Thompson at &lt;em&gt;Stratechery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in his own criticism, “without any of us having a say in the matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpaNg1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eight things Apple could do to prove it actually cares about App Store users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zxs1rWSTamEwA3o5dlvxDuyv1eQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69812654/acastro_210831_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Like hire more than 500 people to police an entire platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4uBPJE"&gt;When you spend money in Apple’s App Store, the company generally takes a 30 percent cut — one that adds up to an estimated $19 billion per year. Apple’s currently in the fight of its life to prove to judges, government regulators, and its own developers that it deserves those dollars, but not everyone’s buying it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXvz2X"&gt;Over the past seven days alone, South Korea declared its disbelief on the global stage, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passing a landmark bill&lt;/a&gt; that could keep Apple and Google from directly collecting their 30 percent cut, and may inspire other governments to do the same. Developers also expressed their rage at an Apple press release, where the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;spun its agreement to settle a lawsuit for $100 million as a $100 million fund for developers&lt;/a&gt; — while quietly promising 30 million of those dollars to the lawyers and enacting no truly significant changes. The CEO of Hopscotch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamJ0hn/status/1431001795904561160"&gt;shared her story&lt;/a&gt; of how Apple’s App Store review team repeatedly gaslit her, insisting there was an issue with the well-liked kids coding app that didn’t actually exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dBidQy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What does Apple’s 30 percent buy you?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="56x8wm"&gt;On Wednesday, Apple made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;a slightly more significant concession for (big) developers&lt;/a&gt;, and as Nick Heer writes, &lt;a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/reader-apps-external-subscriptions/"&gt;the company seems to have momentarily dropped its smug tone&lt;/a&gt;. But we don’t need to get into complex developer negotiations to point out the head-bangingly obvious ways Apple is falling down on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcpu9e"&gt;While the company claims the App Store is “curated by experts,” that it is “a safe and trusted place to discover and download apps,” and that it holds apps to “the highest standards for privacy, security, and content,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the company’s own emails&lt;/a&gt; paint a different picture. They show that Apple &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;for years&lt;/em&gt; about the exact kind of egregious scams that bilk iPhone users out of millions of dollars, long before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;our report&lt;/a&gt;, and yet they keep failing to stop them from invading the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Usc0zv"&gt;It bears repeating: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;Apple is the most valuable and profitable company in the world&lt;/a&gt;. The company currently makes $10,000 &lt;em&gt;every second&lt;/em&gt; on average, $3,600 of which is profit, a large portion of which comes from the App Store itself. (The App Store alone has been a bigger business than the Mac or iPad since 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;see #10 here&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te03HY"&gt;If Apple wanted to change this system, it could. But I expect Apple will only be dragged kicking and screaming into a world with a more functional App Store, because it seems incapable of taking the blindingly obvious steps that might better protect its users — again, despite being the most valuable and profitable company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="240ykh"&gt;Here are eight to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ltL8Vo"&gt;1. Hire an App Review team big enough to actually do the job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ8UlH"&gt;Apple has 500 app reviewers. Just 500 against the entire world; 500 human beings expected to process 100,000 apps per week with some help from automated tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qGlTN"&gt;Even if you were to give Apple the benefit of the doubt and assume that every one of them is a skilled, savvy surveyor sussing out scams in a snap, the math barely makes sense. Even though App Store reviewers typically work 10-hour days (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#68&lt;/a&gt;), the sheer volume of apps means each reviewer would only get 15 minutes to evaluate each app — and only then if they worked without taking any breaks. (Documents also suggest they may work quite a bit of overtime.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8b5o8o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a wetware rate limiting service and nothing more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BnM9pK"&gt;Emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial suggest App Review isn’t necessarily that savvy either, with Apple head of fraud Eric Friedman calling the department “a wetware rate limiting service and nothing more” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#60&lt;/a&gt;), and suggesting its goal is simply to get apps through the pipe. Other documents from the trial seem to back up that idea, repeatedly showing how the App Review team continually pushed for a faster “SLA” (service level agreement, a guarantee that it would review apps in a certain period of time) and sometimes made mistakes when they were working too quickly (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#65&lt;/a&gt;), letting bad apps into the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLUdjJ"&gt;How big should Apple’s App Review team actually be? Hard to say, but Facebook says it has upwards of 15,000 content moderators, Google tells us it has over 20,000 reviewers across its many services, and even Twitter has 2,200 checkers, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="020x4v"&gt;These other platforms admittedly have far more messages than Apple to review — but then again, none of them claim to offer “the highest standards for privacy, security and content” while testing entire programs that run on a pocket computer. Apple could likely do a better job with more reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHxgy5"&gt;And again, Apple is &lt;em&gt;the most valuable and profitable company in the world&lt;/em&gt;, unlike, say, Twitter. It’s pretty easy to argue that the number of moderators should be higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NygPZk"&gt;2. Police its most profitable apps for fraud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sJVeyR"&gt;This isn’t rocket science. Anyone can do it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;I did it&lt;/a&gt;. You can too. Just look for the apps on the App Store that are making the most money, find ones with suspicious user reviews, and inspect them for stupidly high subscription prices — say, $9.99 every single week for a wallpaper app that just repackages wallpapers you can download for free online. Congrats, you’ve found a scam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfPJDp"&gt;The head of Apple’s App Review program wrote in January 2018 that “We need to think about how to stop this from happening,” referencing an entire 32-page presentation about how to trick users into paying for recurring subscriptions using apps that harvest wallpaper, horoscopes, and ringtones off the internet for free. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#64&lt;/a&gt;) Yet we saw those same exact scams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;still running three years later&lt;/a&gt;. When I asked Apple whether it ever goes back to check its top grossing apps for fraud, the company wouldn’t give me a straight answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pGChJ"&gt;3. Automatic scam refunds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv245B"&gt;A dark thought crossed my mind while reporting on App Store scams: maybe Apple doesn’t stop them because it’s more profitable to look the other way. There’s no evidence of that, but you know what Apple could do to eliminate that ugly idea entirely? Universal automatic scam refunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BK3eq"&gt;When Apple retroactively removes scammy apps from the App Store — as it sometimes does when journalists and developers call them out — it should automatically give people back their money, and warn them to stop using those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6f26b"&gt;That clearly isn’t what Apple does today. The company told me it has to review fraud on a case-by-case basis (read: not automatically) even when I specifically pointed out that Apple VP Kyle Andreer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1385062598178078723"&gt;told Congress under oath that it makes scammed customers whole again&lt;/a&gt;. Customers have the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; for refunds, but how would they even know to do that, or even stop getting scammed, if Apple doesn’t tell them about the fraud? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="df7JEC"&gt;4. Stop auto-renewing subscriptions by default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="INrgep"&gt;People hate pop-up messages. You know what kind of pop-up messages I &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; hate? Ones that ask me if I’d genuinely like to keep subscribing to an app or service before I get charged for another month. Every single time, I’d know the App Store was looking out for me, instead of looking out for the company that’s secretly hoping I’m the kind of customer who never bothers to check my credit card bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGPBjL"&gt;I don’t expect Apple to actually do this, because I expect it would be losing out on an immense amount of profit, and might drive some of the most lucrative developers away from the platform — the kind that were leaving because they thought Apple already made it too easy to quit their service. But it would immediately fix the problems of so many people who, when they realized they’d been scammed, went to the reviews section of the App Store to complain that they didn’t know how to cancel their subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="llAFmC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If Apple truly cared, they’d take the same stance with people’s money as they do with privacy: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don’t auto-renew subscriptions by default.&lt;a href="https://t.co/DVOViWOtzu"&gt;https://t.co/DVOViWOtzu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382430603270778890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ehIAe"&gt;I think scam hunter Kosta Eleftheriou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382430603270778890"&gt;has it exactly right&lt;/a&gt;: “If Apple truly cared, they’d take the same stance with people’s money as they do with privacy,” the same stance that Apple CEO Steve Jobs himself &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ij-jlF98SzA"&gt;articulated so clearly in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. “Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them,” Jobs said about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jSOniO"&gt;5. Stop selling ads atop App Store search results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="swDlkO"&gt;While it’s hard for me to be entirely sympathetic with Epic Games’ fight to secure more &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; profits, I believe CEO Tim Sweeney got one thing very right years before he sued. It is &lt;em&gt;ridiculous&lt;/em&gt; that the top App Store search result is almost never what you’re searching for — because another developer can pay Apple to take it away from you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYBexY"&gt;Thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jZb3cG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Really, how did we get to this state? The store prioritizes ad revenue above user intent, so now developers buy ads in front of each others’ products so that exactly nobody’s search results lead to the actual thing they typed. Who in this cycle isn’t crazy?&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1019859186224594944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 19, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B0BPE7"&gt;It seems some developers have gotten wise to this, and by “wise” I mean given into Apple’s greed: Walmart and &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; appear to be paying for the ad slots above their own apps, so searching for them hilariously gives you the same exact app twice in a row. Can you believe Apple’s original plan to give 15 percent back to small developers (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#11&lt;/a&gt;) was to give them store credit for these search ads? “We’ll let you have a portion of the advantage we give to richer companies who pay us” doesn’t sound that generous to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2et1Bg"&gt;These search ads are plainly user-hostile, even if other search providers do it too — and Apple could make a serious statement about its commitment to users by eliminating them from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J08H7N"&gt;6. Lock underage users out of adult apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E0UotH"&gt;In April, we wrote how Apple had unwittingly invited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars%5D"&gt;secret gambling dens into the App Store that masqueraded as games for kids&lt;/a&gt;. Bait-and-switch apps aren’t an easy thing for Apple to protect against, so I can’t call that an egregious failure — though maybe they’d catch more of them if they had more reviewers, yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IvNAk"&gt;Anyway, the Tech Transparency Project recently discovered that minors don’t even have to stumble upon a secret gambling den to access illicit content — &lt;a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/apples-app-store-loopholes-put-children-risk"&gt;the App Store will serve up blatantly adult apps&lt;/a&gt; even if Apple already knows that a user is underage. Creating an Apple ID for a simulated 14-year-old, the Project found 37 adult apps that allowed them to sign up, including dating apps that showed explicit adult content and a casino game, and saw advertisements pop up for additional casino apps that were rated for the 17+ age group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQdwlj"&gt;According to trial documents, Apple’s head of fraud mentioned in February 2020 that the App Store had a problem with child predators, calling it an “under-resourced challenge” and also an “active threat.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#71&lt;/a&gt;). Stopping minors from accessing certain apps wouldn’t be a silver bullet, but it feels like an obvious patch for an embarrassing hole: otherwise, why does Apple bother to collect our ages at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZMdKR9"&gt;7. Bring back the “Report a problem” button&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bJqzgW"&gt;And while we’re on the topic of people who actually identify scammy apps in the App Store and leave their unanswered pleas for help there: did you know the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.dummies.com/consumer-electronics/smartphones/iphone/how-to-report-an-app-problem-from-your-iphone/"&gt;used to have an actual “Report a problem” button&lt;/a&gt; on every single app? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSaoMk"&gt;When I asked Apple about this, the company told me &lt;a href="http://reportaproblem.apple.com/"&gt;it still exists&lt;/a&gt;, but it feels like a joke by comparison. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5n5jj9"&gt;The only way to naturally discover the new link is for users to scroll &lt;em&gt;all the way down&lt;/em&gt; to the bottom of the Apps or Games tab. You can’t even access it from your purchases tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2IdYDw"&gt;It doesn’t actually open in the App Store itself; it launches a web browser, where you need to log in again. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BuSUQB"&gt;If you pick “Report suspicious activity,” the site redirects you to contact Apple Support instead of actually submitting a report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZEDCrt"&gt;If you pick “Report a quality issue,” free-to-download apps are greyed out, with no way to click on them. Apple won’t let you report a scam unless you’ve already fallen for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gDqQ8J"&gt;The only other options are “Request a refund” and “Find my content.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NzYVrn"&gt;If you pick “Request a refund,” it’ll ask you why you think you deserve one, and none of the drop-down options are anything close to “I got scammed.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hb0Kz"&gt;It’s possible, even likely, that if Apple allowed &lt;em&gt;just anyone&lt;/em&gt; to report scams it would be inundated by false reports from rival developers. But Apple already fosters an environment where bad actors can game the system: buying up hundreds or thousands of fake star scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wlADW9"&gt;8. Kill off star ratings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MRtYYE"&gt;Star scores make platforms look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. They allow people who like a product to quickly and easily give it a good “review” with a minimum of effort — unlike traditional reviews where many people only bother to write something when they’re frustrated and angry. Star scores can theoretically even out the bias towards negative reviews, making every product on a storefront look better than it would otherwise seem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="j3be36"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stars let scams flourish&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BiHLwq"&gt;But they &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;allow bad actors to destroy the integrity of the system, because it’s impossible for most people to tell whether an actual user, a robot, or a paid stooge added that 5-star rating. There’s no name to check, no language requirement, no meaningful accountability. So it’s no surprise that some of the most egregious App Store scams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;we described in April&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly thousands of fake 5-star reviews propping them up — to the point that an app with a 4.5-star rating in the App Store would have actually been rated a 1.7 if you looked at the written reviews.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYX4SZ"&gt;So far, Apple’s solution has been to purge fake ratings, and seemingly after the fact. But it could also just purge star scores to begin with, and find a better way — like, say, only allowing positive reviews from people who’ve used an app for a certain length of time. Other platforms like Amazon and Google have similar star score problems; this is an opportunity for Apple to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="viGJxT"&gt;
&lt;p id="pctceP"&gt;In May, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/"&gt;Apple reported&lt;/a&gt; that it stopped $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions before they went through, permanently banned a million accounts, terminated hundreds of thousands of developer accounts, and rejected nearly a million risky apps in 2020 alone. It clarified to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that that $1.5 billion was directly attributable to Apple, too, not just payment processors automatically doing their job. They sound like impressive numbers for a single year on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wR4iQ2"&gt;Also, hours after we published this post, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;Apple agreed to push back its controversial child porn detection features&lt;/a&gt; that had generated a huge outcry, because they broke Apple’s privacy promise in ways privacy advocates feared might lead to a slippery sIope. The company’s clearly listening right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bb3fY"&gt;But the App Store contains far more obvious issues that anyone can see, and it’s clear the company is listening to feedback now. If it wants to justify a 30 percent cut in the name of keeping customers safe, it should embrace some obvious solutions too; ones that vividly show Apple puts people &lt;em&gt;ahead&lt;/em&gt; of profits, instead of the other way around. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s rumored AR/VR headset might rely on a nearby iPhone or Mac for processing </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZaGgOuMpBo3Q_YXEmxhCMfAvUs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69811742/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJUD22"&gt;Apple’s rumored AR/VR headset is designed to rely on another device, and may have to offload more processor-heavy tasks to a connected iPhone or Mac, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-ar-vr-headset-will-need-connection-to-other-device-such-as-iphone"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is reportedly working on a custom chip for the headset, an SoC that’s intentionally missing capabilities found in Apple’s other processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX3luT"&gt;While the new chip reportedly doesn’t have Apple’s neural engine, which handles AI and machine learning, it’s reportedly designed to be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; at wirelessly sending and receiving data, and compressing/decompressing video than traditional chips, which makes sense if the headset is designed to stream data from another device rather than doing the heavy processing itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZFa7pg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A stripped-down SoC for augmented battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="difQ8f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say it’s designed to be as power-efficient as possible for maximum battery life, something that both removing unused parts of the chip and streaming data from another device might help with. For wearable technology, like a watch or set of glasses, there’s always been a delicate balance between battery life and performance/capability. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review"&gt;original Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; handed off many tasks to a connected iPhone, though Apple was eventually able to make its onboard processor powerful enough to handle many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq6vJ0"&gt;If the idea of Apple’s headset relying on a separate device sounds familiar, it might be because of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-19/apple-team-working-on-vr-and-ar-headset-and-ar-glasses?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;this 2020 &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, which mentioned that earlier versions of the headset were meant to work with a separate “stationary hub, which in prototype form resembled a small Mac,” until Jony Ive stepped in to say that it should be self-contained and Tim Cook sided with his design chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEF5Cc"&gt;Ive no longer works for Apple, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Apple’s going back to a bulky or stationary hub: &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reports the AR/VR headset still has its own CPU and GPU inside, and suggests it might be able to communicate with a phone or tablet or even work in a basic stand-alone mode. Some of Apple’s devices, like the Apple Watch, can still perform basic tasks in low battery mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H2Ab96"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Think big picture&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="suzp5N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the device will have an “unusually large” image sensor, as big as one of the headset’s lenses, which has apparently been difficult to manufacture. It hasn’t shown up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;in previous leaks&lt;/a&gt;, but the publication says it’s designed to “capture high-resolution image data from a user’s surroundings for AR”.  That might come in handy considering the headset is reportedly both an AR and VR device — since it’s difficult to do VR without completely obscuring the user’s view, and difficult to do AR without the user being able to see the outside world, the image sensor could be meant to provide a view of the user’s surroundings from inside the headset — similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590794/oculus-mixed-reality-api-quest-2-development-kit-unity"&gt;Oculus’ passthrough view&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps at higher quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRKW00"&gt;While rumors about Apple working on an augmented reality device have been around for years, the idea is still coming into focus. Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;has predicted&lt;/a&gt; that we’d see a “helmet-type” headset in 2022, but &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says that the custom chips for the headset won’t be ready for mass production for at least a year. If that’s correct, even the best-case scenario would be an extremely tight turnaround to get a product out the door by the end of 2022, though that might still be possible if the first version is aimed at developers or a very limited number of early adopters. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says that the sleeker glasses model could come out as soon as 2023, while Kuo predicts mid-2025. Unlike the “helmet-type” headset, the glasses device is rumored to be exclusively for AR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWxWOP"&gt;As for what the headset will actually do, Apple CEO Tim Cook has long enthused about AR and how it will “&lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/the-transcript-of-todays-opening-statement-from-apples-ceo-on-fiscal-q4-2017-is-now-available.html"&gt;transform the way you work, play, connect and learn&lt;/a&gt;,” and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX9xBB_vBsc&amp;amp;t=433s"&gt;let people have “enhanced” conversations&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, we don’t really have a clear picture of what kind of AR/VR features or interface the company wants to implement. Without that, it’s hard to guess whether the device having to offload processing onto something else is destined to be just a quirk of early models, or a design decision that will stick around for years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 may have new watchfaces to take advantage of bigger screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A new Apple Watch watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/myhnsQc4kRDXAiG6XP0LruvP6QE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810488/vpavic_200929_4216_0171.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yD9iC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/apple-s-bigger-watch-will-jam-more-data-than-ever-on-your-wrist?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;shared more details Thursday&lt;/a&gt; about what to expect from the rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;bigger screens&lt;/a&gt; coming to the next Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPk4uv"&gt;Gurman has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the next watch, which he says will be called the Apple Watch Series 7, will be offered in 41mm and 45mm screen sizes. In his new article, he reiterated those sizes and added that the larger model’s screen will measure 1.9 inches diagonally, up from 1.78 inches on the bigger Series 6, and offer about 16 percent more pixels with a resolution of 396 x 484, up from 368 x 448. Both Series 7 watches will also have thinner borders around their screens, Gurman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mfR9IH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is working on new watchfaces&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLmiPO"&gt;Apple is also working on new watchfaces. One, called Modular Max, will apparently show the time, one small complication, and then have larger complications that “span the length of the screen stacked on top of each other below,” Gurman says. Another, which Gurman says goes by the name of Atlas and World Timer internally at Apple, “will let a user see all 24 time zones simultaneously.” One, called Continuum, will “change based on the flow of time and the current hour.” Apple is also working on new watchfaces for its Apple Watches made in partnership with Hermes and Nike. Some of these may ship with the Series 7, according to Gurman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enV59t"&gt;As Gurman has said previously, he reiterated that the Series 7 will have a faster processor and a new case with flatter edges. However, production issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;reported Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; could mean the Series 7 is delayed or in short supply when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gBKZs"&gt;Apple plans to announce the new watches “as soon as this month,” Gurman says. That timeline would line up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21430844/apple-event-recap-biggest-announcements-watch-series-6-se-ipad-air"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20847477/new-apple-watch-series-5-2019-always-on-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will ask before it targets you with its ads in iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMkgnshIHy6fTOFw2REVRR-NYYE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69809320/acastro_170731_1777_0001_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O5vjBv"&gt;Apple will start asking for permission to enable Personalized Ads in iOS 15, the company’s method of serving relevant ads in the App Store and Apple News by analyzing what you read, purchase, and search for on your device (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/02/apple-personalized-ads-targeting-ios-15/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company used to collect that information by default, but now it plans to ask for permission. Apple required other developers to seek users’ permission with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;the debut of App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt;, so it seems like it’s showing that it will hold itself to a similar standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yf5qug"&gt;The Personalized Ads pop-up should show up when you open the App Store if you’re running the most recent iOS 15 beta. In the pop-up, Apple writes that the ads will help you discover relevant apps, products, and services while protecting your privacy by using “device-generated identifiers and not linking advertising information to your Apple ID.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XSUzobPS7GnLP3OmgCSJnTv6BM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822881/IMG_0003.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image:  Mitchell Clark /&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Personalized Ads pop-up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VznZjE"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223"&gt;Apple’s Advertising policy&lt;/a&gt;, the sources it draws from to target ads vary, but they can include your device information (including your location if you’ve granted permission), App Store searches and purchases, and news stories you read in Apple News. The company links to its policy and also lets you turn off personalized ads entirely in the Settings app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u07MXH"&gt;From one angle, this is one of the smallest gestures Apple could make toward treating itself the same way it treats developers — who all have to ask to track users of Apple’s products as part of the controversial App Tracking Transparency policy. As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; mentions, however, Apple’s closed-loop first-party ad targeting technically doesn’t fall under the purview of those restrictions, unlike developers’ apps that may share the information they collect with third parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xo8PjH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple’s rule for other developers: you have to ask users if they want to be “tracked” for ad targeting&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Apple’s own ad tracking is “personalization,” which sounds much less nefarious &lt;a href="https://t.co/hsAQuT8zYb"&gt;https://t.co/hsAQuT8zYb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Heath (@alexeheath) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1433460592619126785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8FYVTU"&gt;Apple’s language choice is worth examining, too, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1433460592619126785?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s senior reporter Alex Heath notes&lt;/a&gt;: developers are expected to ask a user if they consent to being tracked, while Apple is allowed to refer to what it’s doing as “personalization.” Those words don’t exactly have the same positive connotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCOhaS"&gt;This change might be better viewed as yet another minuscule concession — like recent changes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;to what developers are allowed to link to in-app&lt;/a&gt; — in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;the current antitrust scrutiny Apple faces&lt;/a&gt; and will likely deal with in the future. A little ad-tracking pop-up is a small piece of evidence to point to and say, “See, we’re trying to be fair” whether or not they actually are being fair in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle link to the web to sign up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_lfLKzYhZG4Hpchu1XaBtVSESw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69806725/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppIiJC"&gt;While vocal app developers accused Apple last week of spinning a lawsuit settlement into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;an App Store change that was barely a change at all&lt;/a&gt;, the company appears to be making a true, if small concession today: Apple says it will let developers of “reader” apps (think Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon’s Kindle app) directly link their customers to their own sign-up website, where they could potentially skirt Apple’s in-app payment system (and its 30 percent cut) entirely, in those cases where they haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLwik"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/"&gt;In a press release&lt;/a&gt;, Apple claims that the move will close an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), and that it’ll only apply to those sorts of “reader” apps right now — a category that was originally designed by Apple to placate companies like Netflix and Hulu by allowing them to let users simply sign into their existing account instead of signing up for a new subscription via the App Store (and having to pay Apple’s fees).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBg1OS"&gt;The JFTC has confirmed the agreement &lt;a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/en/pressreleases/yearly-2021/September/210902.html"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt; of its own, saying that the move by Apple “would eliminate the suspected violation of the Antimonopoly Act.” The commission, which has been investigating Apple since 2016, says the company has pledged to report on the status of app review transparency once a year for the next three years. According to the JFTC, Apple proposed changing its app review guidelines in response to the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Rk61c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t sign up for Netflix in the app. We know it’s a hassle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AywYGE"&gt;Currently, the Netflix and Spotify apps on iOS are useless if you don’t already have a subscription: both of them only offer a sign-in page, with no link out to their website, and a cheeky apology. “You can’t sign up for Netflix in the app. We know it’s a hassle,” reads the Netflix app’s splash page. The Amazon Kindle app, by contrast, offers a basic “Create a new Amazon account” page inside the app itself, but doesn’t let you buy books there, or even in the standard Amazon app. You have to go to a mobile browser to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGLefKU-OG9ML3YGcbPRlxYRXbE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22821705/netflix_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The message that greets you when opening the Netflix app on iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sB9svf"&gt;The rule change has an extremely limited scope, as Apple claims it only agreed to let developers of so-called reader apps to “share a single link to their website to help users set up and manage their account.” Apple also says it will “help developers of reader apps protect users when they link them to an external website to make purchases,” which suggests it will have specific guidelines for how these links appear. It’s not clear whether developers will be able to mention pricing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SEdgJj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There are just as many questions as answers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Does Apple still get to define “reader” app by fiat?&lt;br&gt;- Can apps explicitly mention payment or price or is that muzzled?&lt;br&gt;- One link - where does it go? Are there rules?&lt;a href="https://t.co/KuKgj9dXuW"&gt;https://t.co/KuKgj9dXuW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1433236886953279489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgu1dG"&gt;It’s also worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation"&gt;when Apple rejected the Hey email app&lt;/a&gt;, and even after it later modified that controversial decision, the company was very clear that email apps do not count as “reader” apps, even if you similarly subscribe outside of the app and the only thing you can do without an account is sign in. Apple is the one that decides which apps qualify as reader apps to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe8wZY"&gt;It also seems like Apple may be slightly redefining what a “reader” app means: &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps"&gt;While the company’s App Review Guidelines suggest&lt;/a&gt; that a reader app “may” allow users to access previously purchased content (presumably alongside in-app purchases, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;like Netflix offered for years&lt;/a&gt;), Apple’s new press release specifies that “developers of reader apps &lt;strong&gt;do not offer in-app digital goods and services for purchase&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(bolding ours). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZ6Kh2"&gt;That would mean that Apple’s only offering this exception to companies that aren’t contributing any in-app purchase commissions to Apple anyways. Which, admittedly, include some of Apple’s sternest critics like Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmkXq5"&gt;However, Spotify isn’t impressed: CEO Daniel Ek &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1433465642737446917"&gt;tweeted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s move is merely “a step in the right direction,” and signaled that the company will keep pushing for new laws like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;the Open App Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fkiIRh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't solve the problem. App developers want clear, fair rules that apply to all apps. Our goal is to restore competition once and for all, not one arbitrary, self-serving step at a time. We will continue to push for a real solution &lt;a href="https://t.co/vzIoBpZQr1"&gt;https://t.co/vzIoBpZQr1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Ek (@eldsjal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1433465642737446917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="41zNte"&gt;The new rule also doesn’t apply to games, of course, the App Store’s biggest and most profitable category and the one at the center of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;trial. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1433234998107201539"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney&lt;/a&gt; obviously thinks that’s unfair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sazzs1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In Apple's carefully-worded statement on safety, it's hard to discern the rationale that this is safe while Fortnite accepting direct payments remains unsafe.&lt;br&gt;Even more so if Apple deems Roblox, a game from 2006-2021 that became "an experience" mid-trial, a reader app.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1433234998107201539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MfifXJ"&gt;Some critics of Apple’s anti-steering rules have suggested they’d like to advertise inside their app that they charge users less at their own website than via Apple’s IAP — since they wouldn’t have to pay Apple that extra 30 percent, they could pass along the savings. But if Apple’s “reader” category doesn’t wind up including apps that offer IAP, that idea probably won’t be possible under Apple’s new rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qre5ui"&gt;It may be a while before we find out the answers to these questions: Apple says the rule won’t go into effect until early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants a Watch with more health tracking and could ship one next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Apple Watch with a red wristband sitting on a table, showing the blood oxygen app. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Z__tueWCUapiDH9cJIZsAxj8gk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804936/vpavic_200930_4216_0239.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xqG5yh"&gt;Apple apparently&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has a growing wishlist of health features for future versions of the Apple Watch, some feasible and some far-fetched. According to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s plans include various types of monitoring, including blood pressure, temperature, sleep, and blood sugar. The details come just after reports that the release of the next Apple Watch is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;likely to be delayed&lt;/a&gt; because of manufacturing issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upEVw8"&gt;Some of the planned features outlined by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; involve adding new sensors to the Watch. Apple wants to develop a sensor that can act as a proxy for a blood pressure cuff without squeezing the wrist. Blood pressure measurement has been in Apple’s plans for years; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/7/17438526/apple-blood-pressure-monitor-patent-apple-watch"&gt;filed a patent application&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 for a wearable blood pressure monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjcQv0"&gt;Apple’s competitors are also interested in blood pressure tracking. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch was approved to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295264/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-blood-pressure-tracking-ecg-korea"&gt;track changes in blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; in South Korea last year. There’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236373/samsung-galaxy-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-health-fda"&gt;debate around the accuracy&lt;/a&gt; and usefulness of the feature, and it has to be calibrated with measurements from conventional blood pressure cuffs every four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDY6p1"&gt;Apple had plans to add a temperature sensor to this year’s Watch, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;earlier reports from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the addition appears to have been&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;pushed to next year. The first slated use for temperature sensing, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, might involve&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fertility tracking, with hopes that it could eventually detect fevers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1WvhI"&gt;Other wearables, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon’s Halo Band&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399307/fitbit-sense-versa-3-smartwatch-inspire-2-fitness-tracker-ecg-eda-stress"&gt;Fitbit’s Sense&lt;/a&gt;, have sensors for skin temperature, though that measurement is different from the internal body temperature read by a thermometer. Earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568421/natural-cycles-birth-control-app-oura-ring-fda"&gt;Food and Drug Administration cleared digital birth control Natural Cycles&lt;/a&gt; to use temperature data from wearables like the Oura smart ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NgLwoY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has been chasing some of these features for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdi1vg"&gt;Apple also wants to expand the Watch’s sleep and blood oxygen tracking abilities, says the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, to someday be able to detect sleep apnea, a disorder that causes people to stop breathing during sleep. Sleep disorders are complicated, and diagnostic sleep studies involve multiple kinds of monitoring through the night. For that feature to work,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Apple would probably&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have to figure out the best times to take blood oxygen readings — keeping the sensor on all night would drain the battery pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRrjFm"&gt;Apple reportedly also plans to seek FDA clearance for existing Watch features, like heart rhythm tracking for people with irregular heart rhythms and alerts for drops in blood oxygen levels. The current FDA clearance for the Watch’s EKG feature doesn’t include use by people who have a diagnosed heart rhythm condition like atrial fibrillation, and the Watch’s blood oxygen monitor isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance"&gt;cleared as a medical device&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV5fIQ"&gt;One of the furthest-out features that Apple is continuing to study, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, is blood sugar tracking and diabetes detection. Apple has been trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15685148/apple-watch-glucose-tracker-blood-sugar-monitoring-diabetes"&gt;develop noninvasive glucose monitoring&lt;/a&gt; for years and reportedly hasn’t had much success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2xPcL"&gt;The anonymous sources cited by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; caution that many of the features being considered “might never be rolled out to consumers.” Health tech advancements, and regulatory approval for them, take years of development and testing. As much as companies want to add a slew of health features to wearables — and even as wearables are more commonly used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;in medical research&lt;/a&gt; — they’re still not advanced enough to replace&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;conventional diagnostic tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVxMIO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says Arizona and Georgia will be first to add state IDs to iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HL-nlwJzhCvdHLRt7SNK_ToFvRk=/129x0:2871x1828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803242/license.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l76xkS"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-announces-first-states-to-adopt-drivers-licenses-and-state-ids-in-wallet/"&gt;announced the first US states&lt;/a&gt; that will support iOS 15’s new ability to store driver’s licenses and state IDs in the Wallet app. Arizona and Georgia will lead the way, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah following after that. No timetable is given for exactly when the new feature will be adopted by these states, however: Apple only says that consumers can expect “more information at a later date.” And the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has again confirmed it will open select airport checkpoints and security lanes to Apple’s mobile IDs once states begin making them available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCu4N4"&gt;Adding a state ID or driver’s license to Apple’s Wallet app works similarly to the way you currently add a credit card. But after scanning your license or ID with your iPhone’s camera, you’re also required to provide a selfie that your state can use for verification purposes. Apple says “users will also be prompted to complete a series of facial and head movements during the setup process” for added security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjsVb3"&gt;Apple is also again emphasizing the privacy protections it has in place for driver’s licenses and state IDs, noting that “Apple and the issuing states do not know when or where users present their IDs” and that biometric authentication is required for the data to be shared. IDs are “presented digitally through encrypted communication directly between the device and the identity reader, so users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYKbqcHbSmH_6pk5prlO3J5q0n0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819957/tsa.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says the TSA will only be able to see specific requested information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E64ENi"&gt;With that last part, it seems Apple is trying to address the concerns that some have raised over what mobile IDs could mean for interactions with police and other law enforcement. It sounds like you won’t ever have to fully unlock your phone to share a mobile ID. The idea that the TSA will let you breeze through security without at least being &lt;em&gt;shown&lt;/em&gt; your phone’s screen feels like a stretch, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAI7M8"&gt;Apple says its implementation of mobile IDs “supports the ISO 18013-5 mDL (mobile driver’s license) standard which Apple has played an active role in the development of, and which sets clear guidelines for the industry around protecting consumers’ privacy when presenting an ID or driver’s license through a mobile device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tls9lJ"&gt;Apple is clearly attempting to counter any hesitancy about the new feature, and proponents of digital IDs maintain that they’re safer and more secure than physical documents. But the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/am/deeplinks/2021/07/dhss-flawed-plan-mobile-drivers-licenses"&gt;ACLU and Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; have cautioned that “longer-term, if digital IDs replace physical documents entirely, or if physical-only document holders are placed at a disadvantage, that could have significant implications for equity and fairness in American life.” They’ve also criticized the federal government for trying to intertwine mobile driver’s licenses with the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/real-id"&gt;REAL ID program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4KCrd"&gt;This new functionality will be included in iOS 15 when the software update is released this fall, but states will dictate if and when they get on board with Apple’s Wallet-based state IDs and driver’s licenses. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password subscriptions are 50 percent off for Verge readers today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52UQahxcn0uMeTuTL6gMzvbz41s=/63x0:1938x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802439/item_details_view.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yk8VZ1"&gt;Many of us would agree that online protection is more vital than ever before, but trying to remember a random string of letters and symbols for every site you frequent — or don’t — isn’t always easy. Password managers like 1Password are a great way to store your login credentials and beef up your security, however, one that can also save you plenty of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDv1yP"&gt;Thankfully, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can save 50 percent on their first year of 1Password for a limited time, whether they opt for an &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-15026552?sid=VergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;individual plan&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-15026551?sid=VergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;family subscription&lt;/a&gt;. The individual plan normally runs $2.99 a month and comes out to be around $36 per year, yet our exclusive discount brings the annual price down to $18. The family plan, meanwhile, will run you $2.50 a month instead of $5, culminating in $30 a year. Keep in mind, however, that the family plan is limited to five people and that each plan is only available to new 1Password users, not returning customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7rckI"&gt;In terms of features, 1Password offers quite a few. Not only does the service store your login details, but it will send you alerts for compromised sites and vulnerable passwords, while security features like authenticated encryption keep your data safe. You can also use the service on unlimited devices and enjoy 24/7 customer support if you hit a snag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Us84ji"&gt;If you have yet to pick up a smart speaker, the second-generation Echo Show 8 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-8-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B084DC4LW6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688708099700197#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $100, matching its best price ever. Unlike the previous generation, the 2021 Echo Show 8 boasts faster performance and a superior 13-megapixel camera. It also features the same display, design, and speaker system as its predecessor, which is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-8/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for $80&lt;/a&gt;. We consider the second-gen model the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart speaker you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you intend to use the smart display for video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qwPCKk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mdfWru"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08WFTZ9LY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling&lt;/a&gt; the 75-inch QLED Q80A Series TV at an all-time low, taking around $500 off the typical list price. Normally $2,700, you can pick up the TV — which was released earlier this year — for just $2,198. Better yet, a few &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers saw in the fine print that if you purchase it before September 30th and use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;B6PXLX23DQL9&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout, Amazon will give you $400 in credit to use on future purchases. Not a bad deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSEQma"&gt;The 4K TV delivers wide viewing angles thanks to its IPS panel while producing bright and colorful images. It’s a good buy for gamers, too, who will enjoy the low input lag and support for variable refresh rate (VRR) and AMD FreeSync technology. While we haven’t tested this specific model, &lt;a href="https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/content/samsung-q80a-qled-tv-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reviewed&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that movie fans may not appreciate the low contrast levels or relatively lackluster local dimming feature, which can make it hard to watch HDR content or films in a dark room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Op1XkD"&gt;Amazon’s current deal comes just a week after the retailer also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08WFLBLWP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cut the price of the 55-inch model by $200&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it to a record low of $1,098. Other sizes are similarly discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="g1p9br"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds, you can pick up a refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164914311936%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeGetaoneyear1Passwordsubscriptionfor50percentoffAUG312021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651065%2F1password-amazon-echo-show-8-samsung-qled-tv-jabra-elite-85t-apple-deals-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$117 at eBay through Jabra’s digital storefront&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;SAVE15LABORDAY&lt;/strong&gt;. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Amazon for $180 new&lt;/a&gt;, meaning eBay’s refurbished discount equates to an additional $63 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk6SHI"&gt;Released in November, the 85t are the first pair of earbuds from Jabra to ship with active noise cancellation. In contrast to the AirPods Pro and Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds, they’re also capable of simultaneously pairing with two devices. You can also buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688339690161172#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t at best Buy right now for $100&lt;/a&gt;, however, if you want solid noise cancellation and excellent on-earbud controls, it may be worth forking over the extra $17 for the refurbished Elite 85t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2zWZiX"&gt;For a limited time, Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Smart Battery Case is more than half off its usual price. Once again, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHMJ77/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750684926448631384#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are both selling the $130 case for a record low of $52. Best Buy is also throwing in a free, six-month subscription to Apple Music and Apple News Plus for new users. The case offers a decent amount of charge — Apple says you can expect “up to 50 percent” extra battery life — while boasting features such as a physical camera button and the ability to charge your iPhone and battery case simultaneously. At the same time, its soft microfiber lining gives your phone some additional protection.  &lt;/p&gt;
