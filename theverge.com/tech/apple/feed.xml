    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-634" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $120 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-337" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$170 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-grade-a-refurbished-1?ref=mwj_cd_deal_7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 at Woot (Grade A Certified)&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a new pair, the lowest price you can get them for currently is at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-23?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot for $190&lt;/a&gt;. If that deal sells out, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=c4f3f58040f1804eb1980afa134f1c7a&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are offering these flagship earbuds for $200; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; has it for $210, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target is selling the AirPods Pros for $235&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rFr0TF"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad 2020 review: here we go again, again|95745" data-volume-uuid="d243cb26d" data-volume-id="95745" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-704" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;You can currently get the base iPad with 32GB of storage for $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Silver%2F460189043%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, Walmart has the 128GB configuration available for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-128GB-Gold%2F984526520%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$395 in rose gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver%2F252643318%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;; that’s $34 off its usual retail price of $429. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s2PEas"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pxIjz0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad mini 2019 review: the best small tablet|63300" data-volume-uuid="e735355f0" data-volume-id="63300" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-670" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PRD2NQ7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5338385a3949a01d236ad3cfbdbfb96d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PRD2NQ7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;385 at Amazon &lt;/a&gt;or for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$394 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$529 in space gray&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$530 in silver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display, and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;

The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;Amazon currently has the fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FD94H?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=28d125e508087b0126bcb88da63044be&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $550 if you buy this configuration in green&lt;/a&gt;, or you can buy this model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J61FCVN?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=15695b649faf4f4c9f5d2fea7ced14bd&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $559 in sky blue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=fb2342e5a68b24c167db1f10168ab217&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;.

Walmart has the same configuration on sale for $559 if you buy the 64GB iPad Air with Wi-Fi in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Green%2F968764839%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F694429303%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases Chrome extension for iCloud passwords</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPJOzakE-NFQSD-3FVRTS26v3AM=/0x0:750x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68749506/chrome.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nimR0D"&gt;Apple has released an official extension for the Windows and Mac versions of Chrome that lets you use passwords stored in your iCloud Keychain. For anyone who uses Chrome as their browser and iCloud Keychain in lieu of a dedicated password manager, this could make bouncing between Windows and Mac computers much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxkLPn"&gt;The release of the extension means that if you’ve used Safari to automatically generate strong passwords on other platforms, those can now be available to you in Chrome when you’re prompted for a login. Passwords created in Chrome for Windows will also sync back to iCloud so they’ll be available on Apple devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHwDIq"&gt;The extension is called iCloud Passwords and is &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj"&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt; in the Chrome Web Store. Details of the functionality were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;prematurely revealed&lt;/a&gt; last week in an update for the iCloud Windows 10 app, which listed “Support for iCloud Passwords Chrome Extension” as a new feature, despite the extension not having been released or otherwise announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Subscribers of Apple TV Plus will continue to get credit refunds until June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqsWxjsHFChML6wk9CwJdtIgMlY=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744478/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RUJvIq"&gt;Apple has notified subscribers of its Apple TV Plus streaming service that they’ll continue to get refund credits on their accounts until June, following a second extension of its free trial program earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/30/apple-tv-subscribers-will-continue-receiving-credit-refunds-until-june"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9 to 5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl2Iwp"&gt;Apple extended the free year-long trials of Apple TV Plus to customers until July 2021. The trials were included with the purchase of any Apple device (an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV) and were initially set to last until November 1st, 2020. This was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;the second extension&lt;/a&gt;; an earlier extension had pushed back the free trial end date to February, allowing users who started a free trial between November 2019 and June 2020 to get up to five months of additional access for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XACfxV"&gt;But before Apple issued the first extension of the free trial, some users had switched to paid subscription status in the meantime, and Apple gave these customers refund credits. It’s doing the same thing for the second extension. &lt;em&gt;9 to 5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; says affected subscribers are being advised via email that they’ll receive monthly credits of $4.99 (or the local equivalent) to their Apple accounts, which will be automatically applied for each month the subscriber is charged between February and June. The credits can be used toward App Store purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway will help Apple re-create the WeWork disaster for TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DcEe8IsHMblxHu1TBS2RoR_cBCQ=/13x0:1908x1263/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68742648/Studio_Project.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e6tCPl"&gt;Apple’s television adaptation of the podcast adaptation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;the real-life soap opera&lt;/a&gt; that was WeWork now has some major talent attached. Jared Leto, the soon-to-be leading vampire of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21062568/morbius-trailer-jared-leto-marvel-sony-pictures-venom-michael-keaton-vulture"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Anne Hathaway, are joining the Apple TV Plus series &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed &lt;/em&gt;as Adam and Rebekah Neumann, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/anne-hathaway-joins-jared-leto-in-apple-wework-tv-series?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yk3ke5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WeCrashed &lt;/em&gt;takes its name from &lt;a href="https://wondery.com/shows/we-crashed/"&gt;the Wondery podcast it’s based on&lt;/a&gt;, detailing the meteoric rise and fall of the real estate company that billed itself as a technology company. Many of WeWork’s problems (and, presumably, the plot of the show) were centered on the Neumanns. Adam Neumann was described as a risk factor in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/000119312519220499/d781982ds1.htm"&gt;the S-1 documents&lt;/a&gt; released before the company’s IPO, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872777/we-work-adam-neumann-tequila-weed-ipo-eternal-life"&gt;a profile of the Neumanns&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; didn’t do much to dissuade anyone that they weren’t completely out of touch. For example, Rebekah Neumann reportedly fired multiple people because she “didn’t like their energy,” and Adam Neumann apparently had plans to become “president of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOao5t"&gt;In many ways, Hathaway and Leto could be perfect for the roles. Each actor has played eccentric one-percenters in the past. Leto took a more sinister turn as a wealthy replicant designer in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16380562/blade-runner-2049-movie-review-harrison-ford-ryan-gosling-denis-villeneuve"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Hathaway had a lot of fun in &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s 8 &lt;/em&gt;as a film star at the center of a diamond heist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4Ovkw"&gt;There’s no set release date for &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed&lt;/em&gt;, but there are plenty of other in-development projects mining tech industry drama. If a gangly take on WeWork seems more your speed, &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21011740/nicholas-braun-cousin-greg-succession-wework-adam-neumann-casting-announcement"&gt;Nicholas Braun is playing Adam Neumann&lt;/a&gt; in another version of the story. And if you prefer your scandals to be blood-oriented, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18305303/kate-mckinnon-will-play-elizabeth-holmes-in-theranos-miniseries-dropout-podcast"&gt;Kate McKinnon is lined up to play Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/a&gt; in a retelling of Theranos’ elaborate fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xQwx6x"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id961390574"&gt;Carrot Weather&lt;/a&gt; — the entertainingly antagonistic weather application from developer Brian Mueller — just got its latest version 5.0 update, which brings a whole new (and far more customizable) design, removes the upfront price tag in favor of more subscription tiers, and, of course, adds new dialogue and Easter eggs for the app’s malevolent AI character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yQnbD"&gt;It’s been a few years since Mueller released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16004062/carrot-weather-4-update-ai-app-ios-dark-sky-forecast-fun"&gt;Carrot Weather 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, and the new update brings a fresh coat of paint to the weather app, with more detailed data that’s broken down into individual cards for things like Moon phases, wind speed, precipitation, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1X8ykyctXGF42743dYRBl-wtWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266256/promo_darkmode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Brian Mueller&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jWF0FT"&gt;Users are also able to fully customize the layout of those interface cards based on the information that’s important to them, and they can swap between different custom layouts easily. (For example, a frequent skier might want to build a layout that focuses on snowfall and wind speed forecasts.) Everything has been visually updated to be more in line with modern iOS UI standards so the whole app will fit more seamlessly alongside the rest of your apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6D3plc"&gt;The new app also is now free to use, instead of charging $4.99 upfront to use. Like the old paid version, though, there are still optional subscription services that can be layered on top for more functionality. A Premium subscription ($4.99 per month or $19.99 per year) adds additional features like selecting weather sources, notifications, widgets, and Apple Watch complications. Premium Ultra ($9.99 per month or $39.99 per year) adds notifications for rain and storms, more widgets, and better data source switching. And a Premium Family subscription ($14.99 per month or $59.99 per year) is the same as Premium Ultra but can be shared through Apple’s Family Sharing with up to five other people. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpEbtzKe9hOWCGws3PMTt12NKzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266257/promo_interfacemaker.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrot’s new customizable Interface Maker tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FQchb8"&gt;If you’ve already been a Carrot owner, though, you’ll get to keep any paid features you already had forever, even if they’ve been moved to one of the pricier tiers. Similarly, existing subscribers to the old Premium Club memberships will be able to continue to pay those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18632642/carrot-weather-app-update-precipitation-notifications-rain-snow-storm-cell-custom-critical-alerts"&gt;lower monthly or yearly prices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlPmy5"&gt;The free version of Carrot Weather includes ads — but for now, they’re either for entirely fake products or for other indie applications. (Mueller says he’s not getting paid for those, either, but views them as a way of “giving back to the awesome indie developer community.”) That said, he notes that he may end up selling ads in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qKEI0"&gt;Carrot Weather 5.0 is available to download now on the App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y16qh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram can now import your WhatsApp chat history</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GpU8TD2Rop8Nn9W0BB1dKs-dp4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732802/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eBGFBy"&gt;Telegram has added the ability to &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/move-history"&gt;import your chat history from WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you won’t lose past conversations if you want to switch messaging services. On iOS the feature arrived with &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807"&gt;version 7.4&lt;/a&gt;, released yesterday and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/27/amid-whatsapp-privacy-backlash-telegram-building-new-tool-for-importing-chats-from-other-apps/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktWDld"&gt;Telegram has &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/move-history"&gt;subsequently announced&lt;/a&gt; that the feature is also available for Android. Alongside WhatsApp, chat histories from Line and KakaoTalk can also be imported, according to Telegram’s iOS changelog. We’ve verified that on iOS you can import chats from WhatsApp into the latest version (7.4.1) of Telegram and continue the conversation, so long as each WhatsApp user has a Telegram account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcEJby"&gt;The addition of the feature comes as Telegram is reporting huge increases in user numbers, with the service now boasting over 500 million active users worldwide. The cause appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;WhatsApp’s new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted privacy concerns about the Facebook-owned messaging app (WhatsApp later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delayed the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of the new policy, and insists it won’t affect the security of consumer chats or profile data). For users jumping ship from WhatsApp to Telegram, being able to take their chat histories with them means one fewer barrier to switching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kuvb8Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Move your message history from apps like WhatsApp, Line and KakaoTalk to Telegram. &lt;a href="https://t.co/PediepRhyt"&gt;https://t.co/PediepRhyt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/VPeuilGt2T"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VPeuilGt2T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Telegram Messenger (@telegram) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1354803936675340292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4MEQ0g"&gt;The import process works on a chat-by-chat basis, but appears to work for both individual and group conversations, at least with WhatsApp. To import a chat from Facebook’s messaging service on iOS, open the relevant conversation, and tap the group or contact name from the top of the chat to open its info screen. From there, the “Export Chat” option opens the iOS Share Sheet, where you’ll see the option to select Telegram. Then, just pick a Telegram chat to import the messages into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPKvJZ"&gt;Meanwhile on Android, Telegram notes that the WhatsApp “Export Chat” option can be found by tapping the three-dot button on the top right of a chat, and then selecting “More.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c4tXdh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's how you can move your chats to Telegram if you're on Android. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VMq3mAeteq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VMq3mAeteq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Telegram Messenger (@telegram) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1354817168932708363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KSOgud"&gt;Any messages imported into chats have a small “Imported” label on them noting when they were originally sent, and when they were brought into Telegram, and messages are visible to all chat participants. You have the option of importing WhatsApp chat histories with or without their images. Imported messages appear in the order in which they are imported, rather than in the order they were originally sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKgxG9"&gt;Telegram’s support for imported chat histories arrives alongside a handful of other quality of life improvements for the messaging service, like being able to adjust volumes for individual voice chat participants, or reporting “fake groups or channels” that are attempting to impersonate famous people or organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mimwDS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 28th, 12:02PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Telegram’s official announcement, including confirmation of Android support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iOS 14 beta will begin forcing developers to ask for permission to track you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ck1xmBMqNbXEgXByF6K_VwzAzk4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732132/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aaqfdv"&gt;Apple’s new privacy feature requiring developers ask  for permission to track iOS users for ad targeting is at last going live in the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8rm6injj&amp;amp;1611853021"&gt;next iOS 14 beta&lt;/a&gt; with a planned full release some time this spring for non-beta users, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87OaT5"&gt;The announcement coincides with Data Privacy Day, as well as a speech on privacy from Apple CEO Tim Cook later today at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels. Apple initially planned for the feature to go live with the launch of iOS 14 last fall, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed its implementation to 2021&lt;/a&gt; in September of last year to give developers more time to comply. Today’s announcement narrows the launch window to “early spring,” but Apple is not commenting further on when exactly we might see it go live for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nd7oq5"&gt;Called App Tracking Transparency, the new opt-in requirement will mark a significant shift in how mobile app developers are able to collect data on iPhone owners and share that data with other firms, including data brokers, to aid in advertising. As it stands right now, Apple lets iPhone owners dig into their settings to disable this type of tracking. Now, instead of forcing users to be proactive about disabling it, Apple will demand developers ask for permission first or risk suspension or removal from the App Store if they don’t comply or try to skirt the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QVqaP8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;App Tracking Transparency will force developers to ask for permission to track iPhone users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUxx5P"&gt;The primary way advertisers are able to, say, know when you are shopping for a new hat on one app before serving you ads for that same hat on another app is that a unique identifying code, the so-called Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), is linked to your device, collected by the first app, and shared with the second. That allows those apps to serve targeted ads and to measure whether the ad actually worked, for instance if you ended up purchasing that hat you saw in an Instagram ad by clicking an ad for the company’s online store in Google Chrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxSJD"&gt;Apple’s new opt-in requirement will make it so developers must have express consent from iOS device owners to allow their IDFA to be collected and shared across apps. App makers can still use other information you give them for the purpose of targeting advertising even if you opt not to let the app track you, but that information cannot be shared with another company for the purpose of ad tracking under Apple’s new policy. The sharing with other third-party companies is effectively what Apple refers to when it uses the word “tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHsXc9"&gt;Apple intends to strictly police any attempt to get around the opt-in requirement. For instance, it says app developers will not be allowed to disable app functionality of any kind if users say no to the opt-in, and that developers will also be barred from charging money or incentivizing users with in-app perks or giveaways to sway their decision one way or the other. Any app that tries to replace the IDFA with another identifying piece of information, like an email address, will be in violation of the opt-in requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBsYIk"&gt;Apple says the rules will also apply to its own apps, and the company already lets users disable personalized advertising the company serves within the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app using data it collects from your device. (It’s worth noting that ad personalization is not the same as ad tracking. App makers can still personalize ads based on first-party data you provide them directly, but they must honor a user’s choice not to share that data for tracking purposes.) Apple has no history of sharing the information it collects with other companies, either, and it makes that clear in its ad personalization toggle in the iOS settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgmZqk"&gt;This is expected to affect both the companies that run ad networks, like Facebook, and the companies paying for the ads, like the aforementioned unnamed hat seller. That’s precisely why Facebook has come out as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures, which include not only this new opt-in requirement but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;app privacy labels it launched on the App Store last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yKojm"&gt;Facebook has positioned itself as a champion of small businesses that risk getting hurt by this privacy change, and small businesses do rely on Facebook’s ad network and its powerful targeting tools to reach customers. Past privacy changes to Apple’s mobile Safari browser did also have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;legitimate negative consequences for ad-supported businesses&lt;/a&gt; like news websites. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is an ad-supported news website.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6AgPuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has emerged as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jA9whl"&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; and statements to the press, Facebook has gone a step further and cast Apple as a hypocrite trying to exempt itself from the rules it forces on other developers and as greedy for encouraging app business models that rely less on advertising and more on subscriptions, of which Apple would theoretically get a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nw5Hub"&gt;“Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on an &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;earnings call on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.” Zuckerberg added that, “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people but the moves clearly track their competitor interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOygv"&gt;Apple has consistently defended its choice as a way to give users more freedom over their privacy and refuted Facebook’s claims it intends to hold its first-party software to different standards. The showdown has emerged as one of the largest and most visible tech company feuds in recent memory, though it’s clear now Facebook has little to no leverage in the situation despite its defensiveness and public posturing. The changes are imminent, and Facebook will be forced to comply as it was with the privacy labels last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBm6te"&gt;To further hammer home its privacy philosophy, Apple has created a new online guide it’s calling “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fprivacy%2Fdocs%2FA_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F28%2F22253366%2Fapple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A Day in the Life of Your Data”&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down common ad tracking and targeting practices in the mobile app and web industries and presents statistics on the prevalence of these practices. Apple cites a study that found the average mobile app contains six trackers that share your data with other apps, and that a “large and opaque industry has been amassing increasing amounts of personal data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6M300o"&gt;“A complex ecosystem of websites, apps, social media companies, data brokers, and ad tech firms track users online and offline, harvesting their personal data. This data is pieced together, shared, aggregated, and monetized, fueling a $227 billion-a-year industry,” the guide reads. “This occurs every day, as people go about their daily lives, often without their knowledge or permission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTlXLA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 28th, 9:05AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified language around the differences between ad personalization and ad tracking to point out that iOS app makers can personalize ads but only using first-party data provided to them directly. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says there are now over 1 billion active iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o3UqHy4EPlB9VLT0KBhjpSJFYMk=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730855/cgartenberg_201105_4276_003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PzxQHS"&gt;Apple says there are now more than 1 billion active iPhones, an enormous milestone for the company that speaks to the phones’ continued success and longevity. There are now 1.65 billion Apple devices in active use overall, Tim Cook said during Apple’s earnings call this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laKAjl"&gt;The milestone had been approaching for a while. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12302542/apple-billion-iphones-sold"&gt;sold its billionth iPhone&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, and in January 2019, Apple said that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18202736/apple-devices-ios-earnings-q1-2019"&gt;hit 900 million active iPhone users&lt;/a&gt;. Apple counts a device as active if it has engaged with an Apple service within the past 90 days, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The stat would suggest that a substantial number of the iPhones ever sold remain in active use, at least by Apple’s definition. &lt;a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-nears-two-billionth-iphone-sale-13-years-after-launch-1.1371339"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BNN Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt; that analysts believed Apple would be approaching its 1.9 billionth iPhone sale by the end of 2020, though the company hasn’t announced if it’s passed that milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzIfJ6"&gt;Apple’s announcement came during an enormous quarter for the company, in which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;set an all-time revenue record&lt;/a&gt;. iPhones did particularly well during the final quarter of 2020, with sales of $65 billion, another record (though one that was helped by delays pushing iPhone 12 sales fully into the holiday quarter). And the company saw more iPhone “upgraders” than ever before. Cook also said that a record-setting number of FaceTime calls were made on Christmas 2020 — a milestone that was certainly helped along by the pandemic keeping many families and friends apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECdPrQ"&gt;While sales are up and usage is at an all-time high, Apple has spent the last several years trying to diversify its product line as iPhone unit sales slow. Analysts have estimated a decline in &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1849696/apples-drop-in-iphone-sales-are-part-of-a-global-demand-shock/"&gt;overall phone shipments&lt;/a&gt; and sales in recent years, and &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-an-interesting-chart-iphone-unit-sales-have-been-declining-steadily-for-five-years/"&gt;Apple hasn’t been immune&lt;/a&gt; to the trend. But even if fewer iPhones are being put into people’s hands each year, people are evidently hanging on to them for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59gy9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 27th, 7:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with details on how Apple measures active devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="IRJ132"&gt;Apple today reported its fiscal Q1 2021 earnings, which cover the final calendar quarter of 2020 and the holiday sales season. That means this is the first time we’re getting a real indication of how the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; are faring with consumers. As it turns out, they’re doing very well. Apple crossed $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the company’s history: it brought in $111.4 billion in total, with earnings per share of $1.68. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfT7Kw"&gt;The latest iPhones went on sale a bit later than normal, and Apple has had to again close some of its retail locations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But despite those obstacles, the iPhone business did extraordinarily well, tallying over $65 billion in revenue. The previous all-time record for iPhone revenue in a quarter was $61.58 billion, which Apple hit in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SBoIW"&gt;Alongside a tweaked, flatter design, the iPhone 12 series is the first to include 5G mobile data, which some have speculated could result in a so-called “super cycle” of upgrades from people who are still using iPhones that are a couple years old at this point. The strong early interest is certainly there; now we’ll have to see if it holds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l89BnE"&gt;Apple’s Mac and iPad lines have seen rocketing sales during the prolonged period of working at home and remote education as a result of the pandemic. The momentum continued in this latest quarter, with iPad sales up a staggering 41 percent — during a holiday quarter, remember — and Mac sales up 21 percent year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPad sales were up a staggering 41 percent year over year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AMFjtu"&gt;The company’s MacBook Air, base-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini are now powered by its own M1 processors. Those three products officially kicked off a transition away from Intel chips that will extend to Apple’s other Mac products over the coming months. The popular iPad Air was also updated in the fall with a more modern design similar to the iPad Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AozzPR"&gt;During an earnings call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said Apple crossed 1.65 billion active devices worldwide during the quarter. iPhones account for over 1 billion of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwYsfe"&gt;Unsurprisingly, AirPods / AirPods Pro and the Apple Watch were a holiday hit for another year running, boosting the wearables division up 30 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMrAuy"&gt;Just as 2020 came to a close, Apple launched its latest paid subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174574/apple-fitness-plus-watch-iphone-release-date-price"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which joins Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, and Apple News Plus as ways of getting recurring profits from consumers who buy Apple hardware. The company has continued to extend the trial periods for some of those services — namely, Apple TV Plus — but the services unit as a whole continues to perform very well and was up 24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoLcF"&gt;Executive shifts at the company also continue. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249393/apple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new"&gt;Just this week, Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that longtime hardware engineering SVP Dan Riccio will now focus on a new, unspecified project; John Ternus — who has publicly introduced well-received products like the revamped Mac Pro, iPad Pro, and M1 Macs — has replaced him as Apple’s hardware boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZjbN2"&gt;The company has also pushed forward with its social initiatives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228580/apple-detroit-developer-academy-equity-center-hbcu-tech-hub"&gt;announcing a number of racial equity investments&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;removed conservative social media app Parler&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store, citing insufficient moderation policies and calls to violence from some users on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
