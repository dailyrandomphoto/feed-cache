    <title>Luna Display’s latest update lets you use a Mac as a second PC display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tHW-4QDGPEPP7WfRVz5Eqpcagag=/266x0:2234x1312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70220047/5c_MattRonge_Astropad_r1_MSP29856_e1637257561528.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7WibN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://astropad.com/luna-display-5-1/"&gt;Luna Display’s latest update&lt;/a&gt; adds a helpful new feature: allowing you to hook up a Windows PC to a Mac laptop or desktop (including Apple’s flash M1 iMacs) to use as a secondary display. The new update also enables 4K and 5K resolution options (assuming you’ve got a screen that supports it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJiyw8"&gt;While Luna Display has offered Mac-to-Mac connectivity for a while, until now, users were only able to connect PCs to iPads using the company’s dongle and software setup. The new PC-to-Mac connection works both wirelessly and through an ethernet connection, just like the Mac-to-Mac option does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vnSmBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Luna Display can now turn your iPad into a second screen for Windows devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724866/luna-display-windows-support-ipad-second-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jsAbyZ"&gt;Additionally, Luna Display’s update adds support for 5K and 4K monitors at full resolutions, although there are still some limitations there: PCs can only run 5K at 30Hz, while Macs can run it at up to 45Hz, assuming they’ve been updated to macOS Big Sur. On the other hand, 4K resolution will run at up to 60Hz on both platforms. Still, combined with the new PC support, Luna Display’s update makes it a nearly perfect solution for using an M1 iMac as a secondary display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9FIlU"&gt;The new update comes hot on the heels of Luna Display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724866/luna-display-windows-support-ipad-second-screen"&gt;adding support for PC-to-iPad&lt;/a&gt; setups earlier this year. Luna Display itself costs $129 for Mac or PC, with USB-C, HDMI, or Mini DisplayPort dongle options available depending on your platform of choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5lh6u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Govee’s immersive backlights are an affordable way to make your TV glow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQxpNE60vXxCMSU3ZwiyHIjNPIA=/0x171:4096x2902/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219052/color_segmented_color.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both Govee’s newest and last-gen Immersion TV LED backlights are on sale today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HEATvR"&gt;If you’re looking to step up your TV game and make watching movies and gaming more immersive, Govee offers a range of colorful lighting kits that also make for great holiday gifts. One of its most appealing products are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review"&gt;Immersion TV LED backlights&lt;/a&gt;, which sync to whatever you’re watching on your 55-inch or 65-inch screen, making it appear as if the TV colors are bleeding out of the frame and onto your walls. Responsive LED strips like these are typically expensive, but right now Govee’s 2020 backlighting kit costs just $61 once you clip the $10 off coupon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the kit’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVGNj7"&gt;Prefer not to shop at Amazon? Govee is selling this product direct &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/immersion-tv-backlights"&gt;for $63&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725979/govee-tv-backlight-bars-review-specs-price"&gt;newer version&lt;/a&gt; of these lights, which farther extends the backlighting with Light Bars. Typically $150, you can &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/govee-immersion-kit-wi-fi-tv-backlight-light-bars"&gt;buy this one for $130&lt;/a&gt; from Govee or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B09B7PY111?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$140 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; when you clip the on-page coupon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Inb6v"&gt;If you intend to gift these to multiple people, Govee is additionally taking 5 percent off your purchase total when you buy two, 10 percent if you buy three, and 15 percent off if you buy five of them. Use the promo codes &lt;strong&gt;XMAS5&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; XMAS10&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; XMAS15&lt;/strong&gt; depending on the amount you’re purchasing. We found that both the 2020 model and this year’s version offer great value for the money, even before the discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="megSUZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10681491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="XieHFJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10896909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VeCscB"&gt;If you missed out on a smart display deal during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you’re in luck: Walmart is now &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSmart-Clock-Gen-2-Grey-Color-Smart-Bulb%2F507060083&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealRoundup1222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering a 60 percent off&lt;/a&gt; deal on the Lenovo Smart Clock 2 with a bundled Lenovo Smart Bulb, bringing the final sale price down to $25. The Lenovo Smart Clock 2 incorporates a touchscreen display into a form factor that would be right at home on your bedside table. It’s one of the smallest smart displays you can buy, yet it still offers full Google Assistant capabilities and comes with a handy night light feature. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22714538/lenovo-smart-clock-2-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PzrRNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869431"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ybzbpN"&gt;The latest AirPods sold out relatively quickly after receiving some of their first significant discounts during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Thankfully, however, Amazon still is selling the third-generation AirPods for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt; at checkout — the lowest we saw them drop to during the recent shopping holiday. That’s a $30 discount on the latest AirPods model, which sport shorter stems, IPX4 water resistance, and improved sound over their last-gen counterpart. However, they lack active noise cancellation, which is found in the AirPods Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ji1ZJE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10887582"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="leY0cM"&gt;If you don’t mind buying refurbished, Sonos is discounting several products right now. For those interested in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Sonos Beam&lt;/a&gt;, the first generation is selling for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeRoundup12221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fbeam-b-stock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$319&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to $399, the full retail cost when purchased new. Although the soundbar lacks support for Dolby Atmos like the second-gen model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; it’s still a competent smart speaker that shares many features in common with the newer version. Sonos is also discounting the third-gen Sonos Sub, selling it for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeRoundUp212121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fsub-g3-b-stock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$599&lt;/a&gt; refurbished. That is $150 less than if you were to purchase the wireless subwoofer new. The second-gen model, typically $699, is also selling for &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeRoundUp12121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fsub-g2-b-stock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$549&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKhOhp"&gt;All of the products in this sale will arrive in a box with all original accessories and cables, and they’ve been certified directly from Sonos. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21530290/refurbished-tech-products-gadgets-where-to-buy-amazon-ebay"&gt;That means&lt;/a&gt; the company has tested and given each an internal and external cleaning and inspection. They also come with a one-year warranty and a 45-day money-back guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="tqzyYp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;If you missed out on a great TV deal during Black Friday, fret not, because Amazon still offering a significant discount on many sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1. The $1,500 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=77&amp;amp;imprToken=8cbebbea-6135-8066-2bf&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22560704%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/22800858%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is still selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt;, while the $2,500 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=78&amp;amp;imprToken=8cbebbea-6135-8066-2bf&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22560704%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/22800858%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch is going for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, however, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.

    <title>Apple may have a problem with iPhone demand as well as supply</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6Pt_bloSZ8pfkCa6qYK5dcV02U=/0x0:2002x1335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218007/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4oAmLl"&gt;Apple is indicating to its iPhone 13 component suppliers that it may not order as many units as expected due to a drop in demand, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-02/apple-tells-suppliers-iphone-demand-has-slowed-as-holidays-near"&gt;report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCBnNe"&gt;While the company had already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; orders for the year to 80 million — down from a target of 90 million — it was reportedly planning to make up for much of the drop next year. Now, though, Apple is said to have told manufacturing partners that this may not happen and they might not see the expected boost in orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpdk2u"&gt;Like almost every other technology company, Apple has been dealing with supply issues brought on by the global semiconductor shortage. CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the company’s last quarterly earnings took an estimated $6 billion hit due to the shortage as well as the impact of COVID-19 on manufacturing in Southeast Asia, and Apple was expecting an even bigger impact on this current holiday quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UmohO"&gt;If Bloomberg’s report is accurate, though, it suggests that the iPhone 13 range might not meet Apple’s initial expectations even without the supply crunch. The original plan to assemble 90 million units for 2021 reflected a forecast of increased demand, as Apple usually orders around 75 million iPhones for the year of each launch. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any AirPods deals to be had. In October, Apple finally launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third generation of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a new AirPods lineup and dropping the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level AirPods from $159 to $129. Since then, we’ve seen many retailers starting to discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even seen some of the first discounts on the latest AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UJyTOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. Moreover, it only sells the model with a wired charging case, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. What’s great, though, is that this version frequently gets discounted, so you can frequently find it for even less. During Black Friday, we saw this model drop to as low as $89. While the price has since increased, you can still find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods discounted down to $109 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;As previously mentioned, the newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model given how recently they launched, but we finally started seeing some significant deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday that are still available. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the $179 earbuds for $150 at checkout, their lowest price yet. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBestAirPodsdeals1222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is also discounting the third-gen model, but only by $10 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and comes with swappable silicone tips. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;recently received a firmware&lt;/a&gt; update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Additionally, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These start at $249, but you can buy them right now for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or $200 at &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/x9zDqO"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not quite as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still roughly a $50 discount off the cost you’d pay through Apple directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently available in various colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $429, or $479 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThsYtSLBr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610235-REG%2Fapple_mgyn3am_a_airpods_max_green.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s ‘notebook upgrade program’ could get businesses new M1 Macs for $30 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="From $30/ Month" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0rqB5rVch510AifqGVWwXx3bWw=/0x130:1162x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217415/FFXiWQ5VgAcOtih.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Mac notebook upgrade program marketing to apparent business partners | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach" target="_blank"&gt;@MaxWinebach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZaNwO"&gt;Apple has apparently introduced a business-only program that enables members to obtain and eventually upgrade computers for a relatively low monthly fee. A tweet from writer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1465326203049414656"&gt;Max Weinbach&lt;/a&gt; shows an image of Apple’s “New Mac Notebook Upgrade Program” promotional material that popped up for a customer with access to a business portal (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/29/apple-macbook-upgrade-program-businesses/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiahGV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The credit application makes clear this is all about the Apple M1 refresh&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXsroC"&gt;The deal appears to be in partnership with CIT Group&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a bank for business customers where this &lt;a href="https://landing.cit.com/mac-upgrade.html"&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt; for the program shares the monthly rates for different MacBook models — starting with the 13-inch MacBook Air for $30, 13-inch MacBook Pro for $39, 14-inch MacBook Pro for $60, and 16-inch MacBook Pro for $75. Apple did not respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the details of the program, while CIT Group declined to comment, directing requests for information to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuLRKU"&gt;The process as listed on the site begins with a standard business financing &lt;a href="https://m1refresh.directcapital.com"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; — just sign the documents after approval, and then CIT will issue a PO to Apple on the business’s behalf. The application page is titled “Apple M1 Refresh,” which lays bare the intention to push businesses to upgrade from Intel-based Macs to their more powerful and energy-efficient successors. The information available does not clarify whether there are any minimum order amounts involved per organization based on size or the exact path to ownership of these machines if there is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJg6lb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;See this is something I'd absolutely subscribe to &lt;a href="https://t.co/QbhtGKGGua"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QbhtGKGGua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1465326203049414656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6No9A5"&gt;Typically, organizations with Apple Business and Education (K-12 or Higher Ed) accounts can create a purchase order for devices and accessories using a special Apple Store site. Apple offers these partners financing, but it usually would be for the complete purchase amounts (save for some small discounts). This new Mac upgrade program now gives these organizations an option to &lt;em&gt;lease&lt;/em&gt; MacBooks, though there is no mention if accessories or other computers will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="CIT Group’s offer for a ‘Mac Notebook Upgrade Program’" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vcuiff_fxBpW3hsBmqFlDZw1bk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23056895/mac_upgrade_program.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CIT Group&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;CIT Group’s offer for a ‘Mac Notebook Upgrade Program’&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u7iM1y"&gt;Assuming a small business with five employees needs five MacBook Airs, they could potentially have them for $150 / month (ignoring taxes) but would have to hold on to them for at least 90 days before being able to upgrade. Still, this means that instead of paying $4,995 upfront for the five notebooks, the small business could hang on to them for about 33 months before reaching the full cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPjfdS"&gt;This aligns nicely with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22781752/apple-business-enterprise-mdm-essentials-cloud-storage-security"&gt;Small Business Essentials support package&lt;/a&gt; that Apple announced in November, enabling small startups to get running — and invested in — Apple hardware without spending a lot of money. It doesn’t look like this will lead to something for consumers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9296849/apple-iphone-upgrade-program-announced"&gt;iPhone Upgrade Program&lt;/a&gt; Apple has offered since 2015. Still, small business employees who carefully eye the annual refresh cycle might get new computers more often.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s terrible year in review is giving me serious Spotify Wrapped FOMO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxXlbpT5wvDkYX9-p0DnxQGOA20=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216672/PR_2021_TopArtist_B_1_2048x1152.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EO66Nl"&gt;It’s December 1st, which for Spotify users, means the annual tradition of the music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android%5D"&gt;streaming service’s Spotify Wrapped roundup&lt;/a&gt;: customized, flashy infographics of the top songs, playlists, artists, and podcast that you’ve listened to over the last year, chock-full of data, mood boards, and just a sprinkling of judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VswuKS"&gt;I, unfortunately, do not use Spotify. Instead, I pay Apple $10 per month for Apple Music, Spotify’s biggest competitor. And so while virtually everyone I know on Twitter and Instagram is spending the entirety of today putting their personal taste in music on blast, I get... a playlist of the songs that I listened to the most this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WEfbNO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spotify Wrapped 2021 is here to take over your social media","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86vZG15pgepbcvNaYWnWuNc_pyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055670/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_11.20.54_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pnZduy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997218/spotify-wrapped-year-end-decade-review-apple-music-streaming-audio-service"&gt;Spotify has been eating Apple’s lunch&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; now with Wrapped, which has practically become its own internet holiday each year. And yet, it took Apple four full years to even launch its bare-bones Replay feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963520/apple-music-replay-listening-history-view-share-albums-songs"&gt;which debuted in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and hasn’t been meaningfully updated since. (I’ve been using kludged together Smart Playlists on iTunes for years to try to poorly replicate the Spotify experience.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l76p7F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spotify beats Apple at its own game with its Wrapped year in review feature","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997218/spotify-wrapped-year-end-decade-review-apple-music-streaming-audio-service"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="t3X0QJ"&gt;2021 is no exception, with Spotify offering what feels like its most lavish recaps yet. My wife (who is a Spotify user) spent the morning showing off her bespoke playlist to me, which included (among other things) specially curated songs for specific moods, rankings of where she placed among global Doja Cat listeners, a color-changing “audio aura,” and an interactive quiz. All of it is designed to be shared and shown off on other social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OALJLqwI2guTQOxG3P5H6-lbCVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055820/jepg.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My wife’s far cooler Spotify Wrapped recap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v1QqJA"&gt;And it’s not just music listeners, either. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doddleoddle/status/1466096651869863966"&gt;Artists seem&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AVABandOfficial/status/1466085854925836290"&gt;love Spotify Wrapped, too&lt;/a&gt;, with their own customized recaps showing off how many millions of times their fans streamed their music around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoJRg6"&gt;It’s not that Apple Music couldn’t do its own version of Wrapped; Apple certainly has the data, and I find it extremely hard to believe that the $2.79 trillion company can’t find the space in its budget to task a team of designers and engineers into building a similar tool. Or maybe it could try to buy Last.fm, which already does a whole bunch of music trends based on customers’ listening habits, if it wanted to offload some of that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opMASI"&gt;And there are plenty of reasons for Apple to do exactly that &lt;em&gt;besides&lt;/em&gt; my annual dose of social media FOMO: Apple has made no secret of its ambitions for recurring service revenue to serve as a key part of its future going forward. And yet, instead of jumping on the easy marketing win and massive user goodwill that a more robust replay feature could offer, year after year after year, Apple just chooses to do the absolute bare minimum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Tmtzi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ah yes, Spotify Wrapped day, or as I like to think of it “punishment for being an Apple Music user while everyone else gets to have fun with their music recaps” day.&lt;/p&gt;— Chaim Gartenberg (@cgartenberg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cgartenberg/status/1466073033462923267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w2OUY0"&gt;Look at it another way: Spotify, every year, manages to get millions of people to spend days posting algorithmically generated Spotify advertisements to every corner of their social media presences, without even offering any free giveaways or incentives. Why &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; Apple Music be trying to get a piece of that action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EFxX8U"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Since I'm an Apple Music user, you please just imagine my Spotify Wrapped to be whatever artists you think cool people listen to&lt;/p&gt;— Monica Chin (@mcsquared96) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mcsquared96/status/1466080039070539780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwoUym"&gt;It’s not even like Apple has to worry about angering Spotify by shamelessly ripping off one of its most popular features: Spotify &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; thinks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457400/spotify-horacio-gutierrez-apple-app-store-interview-decoder"&gt;Apple is a “ruthless bully”&lt;/a&gt; that monopolizes the App Store to favor its own services and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;has filed an antitrust complaint in the EU&lt;/a&gt; to that end. It’s not like there’s a good, healthy corporate relationship to ruin here. If Instagram could shamelessly copy stories from Snapchat, Apple can figure out how to replicate its own version of Wrapped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKvUUn"&gt;In fact, it’s increasingly surprising year after year that seemingly no one is copying Spotify’s absurdly popular data visualizations. With a few exceptions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798429/xbox-museum-20th-anniversary-stats-achievements"&gt;Microsoft’s recent 20th anniversary Xbox retrospective&lt;/a&gt;, there are still virtually no takers on following Spotify’s lead here. Where’s Netflix’s flashy look back at the shows you binged over the year, or PlayStation’s deep dive into how many hours you spent trying to beat Pride and Joy Prototype in &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;? The closest comparison I can think of is Goodreads’ “Your Year In Books,” which also functions more as a straight list than the comprehensive experience that Spotify has created here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liJQX9"&gt;But for now, I’m once again spending December filled with envy as my Spotify-using friends get to show off all their favorite songs, left hoping with increasingly futile optimism that maybe Apple Music will figure things out next. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big tech’s first generation of founders starts to step aside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jeff Bezos’s India Visit Marked By Probe and Protests" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_R7fyPRCD47GK1go_CdRw566v4=/0x0:2138x1425/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214184/1193819818.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JC8jKS"&gt;Massive tech companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix, and more have had a huge impact on the way we live our lives, and have had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;incredible levels&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/"&gt;financial success&lt;/a&gt;. Another thing many of these companies have in common is that their founders are no longer necessarily in control; they’ve either stepped down, started sharing power with others, or in some cases possibly even been pushed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hAI6N"&gt;This week alone, Twitter co-founder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and Salesforce founder Marc Benioff &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/salesforce-promotes-bret-taylor-to-co-ceo.html"&gt;became a &lt;em&gt;co&lt;/em&gt;-CEO&lt;/a&gt;. They’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1EMUxc"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba&lt;/strong&gt; — Jack Ma stepped down as CEO of the giant Chinese tech company in 2013, and retired from his position as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/tech/jack-ma-retire-alibaba/index.html"&gt;executive chairman in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. At the time he still had a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/alibaba-jack-ma-retire.html"&gt;considerable amount of power in the company&lt;/a&gt;, but after a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-19/ant-s-record-ipo-remains-in-limbo-a-year-after-china-crackdown?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;stalled IPO for the division he was in charge of&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/billionaire-alibaba-founder-jack-ma-reappears-hong-kong-sources-2021-10-12/"&gt;disagreements with the Chinese government&lt;/a&gt;, it’s hard to say how much power he still holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EujqeX"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Amazon &lt;/strong&gt;— In July 2021, Jeff Bezos officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;handed the CEO position of Amazon over&lt;/a&gt; to former Amazon Web Services head Andy Jassy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LI0HDf"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apple &lt;/strong&gt;— Tim Cook was &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/01/14Apple-Media-Advisory/"&gt;temporarily left in charge of Apple&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 while Steve Jobs underwent medical treatment. Jobs returned to the company, but then put Cook in charge for another leave of absence in 2011, before permanently making him CEO later that year. Around the time of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;his 10-year anniversary as CEO of Apple&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, Tim Cook said he doesn’t intend to run the company for another decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="03YCHp"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ByteDance — &lt;/strong&gt;Zhang Yiming, founder of the company that owns TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445212/tiktok-bytedance-ceo-zhang-yiming-steps-down"&gt;announced he’d be stepping down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; this May. In an internal letter, he said he worried about “relying too much on the ideas I had before starting the company.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nPcfNv"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; — In August 2015, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20994361/google-alphabet-larry-page-sergey-brin-sundar-pichai-co-founders-ceo-timeline"&gt;moved on to overseeing Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, the holding company for Google’s disparate properties. The shakeup was seen as them taking their hands off the search engine company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/10/9128083/sundar-pichai-ceo-google-larry-page-sergey-brin"&gt;leaving Sundar Pichai in charge&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20994218/google-alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-larry-page-sergey-brin-step-down-control-management"&gt;Pichai took over as CEO of Alphabet as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="geIrqO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Instagram &lt;/strong&gt;— In September 2018, Instagram’s co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger announced they were stepping down, reportedly after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking"&gt;major disagreements with Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8zbaph"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft &lt;/strong&gt;— Microsoft founder Bill Gates’ departure happened in many stages, with him first stepping down as CEO in 2000, then leaving his full time position at the company he helped found in 2008, and finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;stepping down from his position on the board last year&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is currently being run by Satya Nadella, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537683/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-chairman-bill-gates-john-thompson"&gt;acts as both CEO and chairman of the board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="boWSkR"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Netflix&lt;/strong&gt; — In July 2020, Ted Sarandos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327550/netflix-ted-sarandos-ceo-netflix-reed-hastings-board-member-originals-tv-movies"&gt;joined Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings as co-CEO&lt;/a&gt;. The company said that Sarandos was already helping lead (he’d been &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/outside-the-box-2"&gt;with the company for twenty years&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/co-ceos-are-out-of-style-why-is-netflix-resurrecting-the-management-model-11594987416"&gt;was in charge of its original programming&lt;/a&gt;), and that him joining Hastings as CEO was just a formalization of his role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sw7urw"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Salesforce&lt;/strong&gt; — Bret Taylor, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;replaced Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; as Twitter’s chairman of the board on Monday, is also becoming the co-CEO of enterprise tech giant Salesforce, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/salesforce-promotes-bret-taylor-to-co-ceo.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not the first time Marc Benioff, the company’s CEO and founder, will be sharing power, but it’s another instance of a former deputy starting to gain more power within a tech giant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UUkvbR"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Twitter &lt;/strong&gt;— On Monday, November 29th, Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;announced he was leaving Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and said “I’ve decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrn2YB"&gt;It’s probably worth noting that all of the founders listed above were men, and were replaced by men, which isn’t a great trend. There are a few notable women in power — Meta’s COO Sheryl Sandberg, and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki. As of this writing, neither has indicated whether they plan to depart their posts any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ld7HAA"&gt;There are, of course, exceptions to the trend. The most notable is Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s complete control over Meta. He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t have plans to give up his job, and it’d be pretty much impossible for shareholders to force him out, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/opinion/tech-dual-class-stock.html"&gt;thanks to the company’s stock structure&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from Zuckerberg, a couple of other CEOs come to mind: Jensen Huang is still in charge of Nvidia (until it &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-faked-part-of-a-press-conference-with-a-cgi-ceo/"&gt;replaces him with a digital AI avatar&lt;/a&gt;), Tencent co-founder Ma Huateng still acts as CEO and chairman of the company, and Snapchat is still helmed by Evan Spiegel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjaxxe"&gt;Obviously, tech companies can survive and thrive without their founders — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753251/microsoft-apple-market-cap-business-valuable-company"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; are the two most valuable public companies in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EA086j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated December 1st, 3:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; — Added information about Tencent and Alibaba, and about female leaders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is still available for $100 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="There’s a new “artist” watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pwo-krebX5FSpEg-K5CpOf96Zls=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214134/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&amp;nbsp;last-gen Apple Watch&amp;nbsp;Series&amp;nbsp;6 is just $299 at Best Buy.&lt;/em&gt; | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oBXrF4"&gt;Cyber Monday may be over, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22560704"&gt;Cyber Week continues&lt;/a&gt;. If at any point this past weekend you missed out on an Apple Watch deal you were keeping tabs on, fret not, you can still pick up the 40mm, GPS version of the Apple Watch Series 6 for just $299 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6P6nRg8YX?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22560704%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fgood-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a $100 discount on the otherwise $399 wearable, which offers built-in sleep tracking, a blood oxygen sensor, and an always-on display. It’s a more affordable alternative to Apple’s new Series 7, with features you won’t find in the similarly priced Apple Watch SE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6eNhN"&gt;For new subscribers, Best Buy’s also throwing in six months free of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;, an exercise service that integrates nicely with the Apple Watch and offers fitness classes. Note, however, this deal is only available on the watch sporting a blue aluminum case with a deep navy sport band. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4bGXYc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869070"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ubcln"&gt;If you’re looking for a good holiday gift for the gamer in your life, the PlayStation Store is currently discounting several PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 digital titles by up to 80 percent as a part of its &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/e5204033-886e-42f1-a51c-641b8f051988/1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“End of the Year” sale&lt;/a&gt;. PS4 owners can, for example, pick up a digital copy of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512337/mortal-kombat-11-ps4-xbox-switch-ed-boon-interview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat 11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for just &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1018-PPSA01617_00-00MORTALKOMBAT11" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10&lt;/a&gt; ($40 off) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17817392/spider-man-marvel-ps4-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Spider-Man: Game of the Year Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA02299_00-MARVELSSMGOTY000" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off). Both PS4 and PS5 owners can also enjoy 60 percent off of the $80 Deluxe or $100 Gold editions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/12/21319059/assassins-creed-valhalla-hands-on-preview-pc-xbox-one-ps4-gameplay-ubisoft-rpg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are on sale for &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-PPSA01491_00-EDITIONDELUXE000" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$32&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-PPSA01491_00-EDITIONGOLD00000" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The sale will last through December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e3HeC6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10325914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZtpQJM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10894786"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ww8097"&gt;For gamers who are on the market for Nintendo Switch titles, Best Buy also &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6UqhIxGzh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has a great sale going on&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, you can buy two games from a small selection of popular titles and get the third game of equal or lesser value for free. The bundle also applies to some games that are already on sale, which could translate to even greater savings. Current standouts include physical versions of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6UojaxBHm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($60), as well as &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6XpzmpvQv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey Standard Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($38) and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6UpIJQOQV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($45). Just hit “Build my package” at the top of the screen to customize the promo to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4zc4rU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10894882"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="JevUJd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"},{"title":"Super Mario Odyssey review: an absolute delight","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OnEuOk"&gt;We saw a lot of great deals on wireless earbuds this past week, though, sadly, many of them have already expired. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=VergeDailyDeals113021B&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt; is selling Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 — the most recent addition to Samsung’s Galaxy Buds lineup — for just $100 in various styles through December 3rd or while supplies last. That matches the lowest price we saw on the earbuds during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s worth noting that these have a 90-day Woot warranty, not the full one-year warranty against manufacturer defects from Samsung. If you’d rather have that longer coverage, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf7eCx2C2YN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight/dp/B0942DM32W/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have them for just $10 more, totaling $110.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2l43za"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted that these lightweight, entry-level earbuds offer active noise cancellation, wireless charging, and a small, low-profile design. They also showcase good audio quality, making them an easy pick for many Android users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hpDz1I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7KD7Xp"&gt;If you managed to score a great deal on an iPad this week, why not make using it even more fun with some great discounted accessories? Apple’s Smart Keyboard Folio makes it easier to use your iPad Pro or iPad Air more like a traditional laptop, and right now it’s selling for its lowest price to date. Typically $179, the basic accessory is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08635GZ8H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently going for $99&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the case is only compatible with the first, second, and third generations of the 11-inch iPad Pro, as well as the fourth-generation iPad Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YqSeOV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EdNQFR"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other notable deals happening:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wfOJKf"&gt;Govee’s Immersion TV backlight kit that include a camera for color calibration (with support for 55-65-inch TVs) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is all the way down to around $60&lt;/a&gt; after you clip the $10 coupon at Amazon.

    <title>These transparent Apple prototypes clearly show the greatness of see-through gadgets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axwYftqTABRQUzQluiXTwk4WCUs=/0x168:4030x2855/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211546/FE5CyAvWUAQBTe0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1463180368555782152?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;Giulio Zompetti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Flm7ya"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611234/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-working-prototype"&gt;Apple device collector Giulio Zompetti&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1463180368555782152"&gt;photographed a prototype 29W Apple charging brick&lt;/a&gt;, and it may be one of the rare instances where the product-in-progress may look better than the final version. What makes it special is that you can literally see Apple’s design process because of the clear plastic shell, unlike the retail version where the internals are hidden by opaque white plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ws2aIQ"&gt;Zompetti also tweeted another clear prototype, a pair of AirPods that live up to the “Air” name. The retro-futuristic look of the densely packed electronics makes me wish Apple would actually sell see-through gadgets again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9kxFUv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="da" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AirPods?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, translucent prototype earbuds &lt;a href="https://t.co/zE4dt47H0J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zE4dt47H0J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Giulio Zompetti (@1nsane_dev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1465690029611749380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QGcrea"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;29W Apple Charger prototype. &lt;a href="https://t.co/h2ZoHCMw0F"&gt;pic.twitter.com/h2ZoHCMw0F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Giulio Zompetti (@1nsane_dev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1463180368555782152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U5WcHC"&gt;Transparent electronics were a (cool) fad in the 90s, with Apple’s own &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/12/20-macs-for-2020-1-imac-g3/"&gt;iMac G3&lt;/a&gt; often being brought up by those reminiscing about the age of transparent or translucent electronics, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/96k213/seethrough_electronics/"&gt;alongside the Nintendo 64&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href="https://medium.com/slackjaw/gizmodo-product-review-1987s-unisonic-clear-telephone-model-6900-e885927a43f3"&gt;Unisonic clear landline phone&lt;/a&gt;. But the look does seem to be having a sort of revival: you can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/teardown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy skins&lt;/a&gt; that make it look like you’ve done a transparent mod on your phone (without the risks that come with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEWO68Tegf8"&gt;scraping off the back panel’s paint or plastic&lt;/a&gt;), and companies like Nothing are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;releasing actually see-through gadgets&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not to mention the variety of after-market mods for consoles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/eXtremeRate-Transparent-Replacement-Nintendo-Switch-Controller/dp/B08M3GK34W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; that let you replace the device’s opaque plastic with a case that shows off the internals. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Twn0c-dBoERdfppSqd1NX8_jGMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746960/DSCF4386_Edited.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing’s Ear 1s look a lot like the prototype AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0FxS8jOPIItIlAZE20E8IbrWIk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053567/0ry14gzswhl71.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit user Odellot posted a massive collection of see-through gadgets, including a PS5 and DualSense controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q3sfhL"&gt;These days, it feels unlikely that Apple would actually sell whimsical clear devices — we can barely get colors on pro devices, and the Apple logo hasn’t started glowing again, despite the new MacBook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;including a refreshed design&lt;/a&gt;. But I can hope that Apple will return to its roots if transparent devices start coming back in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZx7oE"&gt;So come on, Apple; your engineers do impressive work, which you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tobL8U7dQo"&gt;love to show off in presentations&lt;/a&gt;. Why not let it see the light of day and make us feel like it’s the future again by giving us some transparent accessories? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQhy9O"&gt;If you love seeing the internals of Apple devices, Zompetti also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611234/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-working-prototype"&gt;posted pictures of an AirPower prototype&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, showing off some incredible circuitry. You can also check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18263844/apple-iphone-prototype-m68-original-development-board-red"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s story on the original iPhone prototype&lt;/a&gt;, which looked more like a breadboard electronics project than the pocketable device it would eventually become. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals you can get on Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8qbwNvRtOz3aWm0Swd3D9CY2VoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166146/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The AirPods Pro with the MagSafe charging case are on sale for just $190 at Amazon. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for Apple discounts ahead of Cyber Monday, you won’t find them at Apple, even if the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event"&gt;bundling Apple gift cards with almost all of its latest products&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Many of these retailers started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Cyber Monday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if you’re looking to save even more, make sure to check out our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;best Cyber Monday deals happening now&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re highlighting the best deals you can get across all products, brands, and retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="DpLcAU"&gt;The third-gen AirPods were released just last month, and now you can buy them on sale for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The extra $20 off is reflected at checkout. These newest base-model AirPods may not have noise-cancellation but their hard-plastic design should fit most ears while offering IPX4 water resistance, improved sound quality, and spatial audio. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hQOZ8w"&gt;The popular AirPods Pro can be had for $170 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLWK3AM-A-New-AirPods/dp/B09JQMJHXY?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=48&amp;amp;imprToken=12beac1d-3fc0-1d9b-f48&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22556052%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to its normal full price of $249 (saving you $90). &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3urgh0XZ0?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22556052%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/apple-airpods-pro/-/A-84852592?preselect=77603773#lnk=sametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22556052%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; also have it marked down but only to $190.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lLCckh"&gt;Apple’s second generation of true wireless earbuds, the AirPods, are selling for &lt;s&gt;$100&lt;/s&gt; $115 instead of $159 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This particular model comes with a wired charging case, however, you can pick up a pair with the wireless charging case for &lt;s&gt;$150&lt;/s&gt; $100 instead of $200 from &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F482532021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RVzOFA"&gt;Last year’s M1-equipped MacBook Air is, in our opinion, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, you can buy the 512GB model with 16GB of RAM for $1,399 in gold or space gray at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604840-REG%2Fapple_z125_mgn7_04_bh_13_3_macbook_air_with.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x1080441%2FSID%2Fprice-guide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22787892%2Fapple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
