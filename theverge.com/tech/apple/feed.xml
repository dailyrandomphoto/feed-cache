    <title>Apple’s new iPad Pros and TV remote don’t have U1 locators to help find them in your couch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmctdqcCJ27r-jb8zh79NUa694Q=/0x0:1478x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159216/2UiJGkD.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rsm2tv"&gt;Apple has been quietly sticking special locator beacon chips into some of its new iPhones that’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;let you unlock your car&lt;/a&gt; and find lost items through walls — the latter thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;the $29 AirTags&lt;/a&gt; announced today — but sadly, you won’t find that chip in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;the new M1-based iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;the long-awaited new Siri remote&lt;/a&gt; for the Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QztKa9"&gt;Apple confirmed to us that the U1 locator chip, which uses pulses of ultra-wideband (UWB) radio to broadcast its precise location, won’t appear in the Siri remote. We’re waiting on final bulletproof confirmation about the iPad Pros, but it also doesn’t appear in their product page, spec sheet, or press release. Last year’s iPad Pros didn’t include a U1 chip, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nUhMXp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckqvG0Rj35I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Za91aO"&gt;Is Apple expecting us to stick AirTags to our iPads and TV remotes to escape the jaws of the ever-ravenous couch? Unlikely, but the company has been pretty choosey about which devices get the chip so far. You can find it in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859550/apple-iphone-11-pro-airdrop-u1-locator-chip-tag-tile-bluetooth-tracking"&gt;the iPhone 11 and newer&lt;/a&gt; (but not the iPhone SE) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; (but not the Apple Watch SE), but we’re pretty sure it hasn’t made its way to any iPads or MacBooks that have been announced since the chip’s introduction in September 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFRFzN"&gt;Theoretically, Apple could build an ecosystem where any Apple device can easily find any other Apple device (not to mention UWB devices from Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;which is also deeply invested in the tech&lt;/a&gt; and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date"&gt;its own AirTag-like device&lt;/a&gt; as well). But for now, you’ll primarily just be using your phone to find AirTags, not other gadgets, except perhaps your future car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pODdAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLgfVN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emyNjp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHfFuv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly reveals that iOS 14.5 will arrive next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TUSQo9wvznWlWZ9pyHG1BruKEuE=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158860/findmy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 14.5 will enable use of AirTag trackers to help locate tagged items using Apple’s Find My feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wYXsIE"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-introduces-airtag%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394200%2Fapple-ios-14-5-watch-os-7-4-mac-os-11-3-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;new Tile-like AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt;, the company has revealed that iOS 14.5 will officially arrive “starting next week” — as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Joanna Stern&lt;/a&gt;. AirTags go on sale April 30th and will only work with devices running iOS 14.5 or higher. Likewise, watchOS 7.4 and macOS 11.3 will also launch next week, as they support new Apple Podcast feature updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwDeAc"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267230/apple-ios-14-5-watchos-7-4-public-beta-unlock-iphone-apple-watch-mask"&gt;first launched the 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt; to the public earlier this year in February alongside watchOS 7.4 beta (no word on whether that’s arriving soon, too). Along with AirTag support, it will implement Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; requirement, which mandates that developers ask for permission to track users for ad targeting. The feature was announced last year and met with sharp resistance from Facebook in particular, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;argues that the move&lt;/a&gt; will harm small businesses that benefit from ad tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaQHf"&gt;iOS 14.5 also introduces some welcome inclusivity features, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;ability to change Siri’s voice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;new skin tone options&lt;/a&gt; for some emoji. Another feature we’ve appreciated in our testing thus far is Siri’s ability to learn which audio-listening apps you prefer for certain activities. This stops short of letting you select a new default app, like picking Spotify for all of your streaming music requests, but it’s a helpful evolution in any case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWsSBM"&gt;Of course, this feature may or may not make it to the final release, but we &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;know now when we can expect to find out which features made the final cut. Apple doesn’t say specifically which day we can expect 14.5, but when it does, iPhone users will be able to download the update in their phone’s settings as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ycu2tJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A first look at Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS and the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtQzQbETtYs7zwp7GZhFlnHcsOk=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158828/xcloudiphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Game Streaming running on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1OuUcS"&gt;Microsoft has started inviting Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to test its Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service on iPhones and iPads today. The service works through web browsers, allowing it to also run on PCs and Macs on Edge, Chrome, or Safari. We’ve managed to get an early look at this beta and see how Xbox Cloud Gaming works on an iPhone or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQRIZq"&gt;The web interface for xCloud (yes, we’re going to keep calling it xCloud) is very simple to use. It scales across devices like the iPhone, iPad, or even a large monitor attached to a PC to provide quick access to games. Microsoft has even included a search interface, which is something that’s strangely missing on rival service Google Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIiBSM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;here’s a first look at how xCloud, or Xbox Cloud Gaming, works on an iPhone. Full details here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4QlTfCCjSQ"&gt;https://t.co/4QlTfCCjSQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Td6TOKZh9d"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Td6TOKZh9d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1384594572622319616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tfadur"&gt;You don’t need to install any apps or extensions; it works natively in Chrome, Safari, or Edge. All you need is a compatible USB or Bluetooth controller. Some games even work with Xbox Touch Controls, so a controller isn’t required if you’re happy to tap on the screen and play. I managed to quickly start games using an Xbox Elite 2 controller paired to an iPhone 11 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ewqJY"&gt;Once you launch a game, you’ll have to wait a fair amount of time for it to actually load. Much like xCloud on Android, the backend servers for Microsoft’s Xbox game streaming are actually Xbox One S consoles. This older Xbox hardware isn’t powered by a modern CPU or SSD, so game loads are affected as a result. Microsoft is planning to upgrade xCloud servers to Xbox Series X hardware at some point this year, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGUsoHhwMiYbZ1T0EQUfuKrkRX4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457711/20210420_190102000_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Game Streaming on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E29pDW"&gt;I’ve only been playing xCloud via the web for a few hours, so it’s difficult to judge the experience, but I’ve certainly run into a lot of connection issues both wireless and wired with my desktop PC. Microsoft says it’s working on a routing issue with this beta, but it’s worth pointing out this is a test service, and it’s only just launched, so hiccups like this are to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gURABC"&gt;Once the connection settles down, it’s very similar to xCloud on Android. If you run this through a web browser on a PC or iPad, you’ll even get a 1080p stream. It feels like I’m playing on an Xbox in the cloud, and there’s a dashboard that lets me access friends, party chats, achievements, and invites to games. This is all powered by Xbox Game Pass, so there are more than 100 games available — and even some original Xbox and Xbox 360 titles that can be streamed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6TQaAuBYmCrYOhEtLTW0hOVA0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457712/20210420_190115000_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can search and easily launch Xbox games in a browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwkKce2up0hlNX-QGfr1gZ9icBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457713/20210420_190300000_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Touch Controls can be used for certain games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="59BiXk"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t said when the company plans to roll this out more broadly yet, but given the early connection issues, there’s clearly still some work to be done until the web version is available for everyone. Still, it’s impressive how well this scales across multiple devices and opens up the ability to stream Xbox games to virtually any device that has a Chromium or Safari browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jklbgr"&gt;I also tried this xCloud browser version on the new Edge app for Xbox consoles, but it’s not fully supported yet. Both the service and the browser are in early beta right now, so full support might come at a later date. Either way, I imagine that xCloud will arrive on Xbox consoles through the ability to quickly stream a game while you’re waiting for it to download in the background. That’s really where xCloud makes sense on a console that can already play Xbox games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwRUeA"&gt;This browser-based version of xCloud does open up the service to many more possibilities, too. Xbox chief Phil Spencer has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529925/xbox-tv-streaming-stick-xcloud-cloud-gaming-phil-spencer-interview"&gt;hinted at TV streaming sticks for xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft has already committed to bringing the service to Facebook Gaming at some point. It’s easy to imagine Xbox Game Streaming apps for smart TVs, coupled with the ability to access the service from web browsers to ensure almost any device can access an Xbox Game Pass subscription. That’s clearly Microsoft’s goal here, and this beta feels like just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can buy Apple’s new $60 Siri remote a la carte for your old Apple TV, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZPHPzKC2sV17O3sBiRfsOEIBdE=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158556/WcGeQVXeT3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0Yd0E"&gt;Apple has finally excised its much-maligned Apple TV remote with a new iteration that ditches the confusing touchpad for some good old-fashioned buttons. But you won’t need to shell out for Apple’s updated Apple TV 4K to get one. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJFM3LL%2FA%2Fsiri-remote%3Ffnode%3De0808b838ac7ea88235c6447b1de687c55374fe65132236210b1cfe210a480f89a3f5e474d0a29621a712e1b6c12a7335755ab03d7c030e82feb310eb3b42cb7ae1bd481f1be764276fa9fab07b2e4d3d3d19928bd2232c89d048c164e0482e8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394196%2Fapple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is selling the new remote separately for $59&lt;/a&gt;, and customers will be able to use it with any tvOS-based Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlfgyD"&gt;That means even if you own the first-generation Apple TV 4K or the original fourth-generation Apple TV from 2015 that debuted the Siri remote, you’ll be able to upgrade to the new and improved clicker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oztJrq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple unveils a redesigned remote for its new Apple TV 4K","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"},{"title":"Apple announces new Apple TV 4K","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="l6EfLM"&gt;This is great news for anyone who still has an older model since the original Siri remote is terrible, and Apple’s newly refreshed Apple TV 4K models are still on the extremely high end of the spectrum for a new set-top box — especially if you already have the first-generation Apple TV 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHeG3Q"&gt;The new Siri remote is also replacing the old (bad) model in all new Apple TVs sold going forward, which includes both the 32GB and 64GB versions of the new Apple TV 4K and the inexplicably still-on-sale Apple TV HD (which, at $149 for the six-year-old set-top box, is an extremely hard sell compared to the $179 just-refreshed Apple TV 4K).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8osVa"&gt;Preorders for the new Siri remote will open on April 30th and will start to ship sometime in the second half of May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9pvtv"&gt;By the way, Apple confirms the new Siri Remote does not have a U1 locator chip inside, so it’s still on you to find it when it gets buried in your couch cushions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Spring Loaded event: the 8 biggest announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fKtWIrmSaYMyFF4-knoc1DDNxDU=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158113/OzNiZK1.0.jpeg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="dN7cX0"&gt;Apple just wrapped up its “Spring Loaded” event, announcing new iPads, iMacs, and more. It was jam-packed with news from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tri6hY"&gt;If you want to read about what was announced as it happened, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384269/apple-event-live-blog-news-announcements-ipad-pro-spring-loaded"&gt;check out our live blog&lt;/a&gt; with commentary from Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Chaim Gartenberg.

&lt;p id="LQgYgx"&gt;Apple unveiled its newest iPad Pro tablets, and they’re equipped with the same Apple-designed M1 chip in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini (and the new iMac, also announced today). The 12.9-inch model has an upgraded display that uses 10,000 Mini LEDs, and Apple calls it the Liquid Retina XDR display. Both iPad Pros also have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that can automatically track you during video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3W8ao"&gt;You can order the tablets on April 30th, and they will be available in the second half of May. The 11-inch model starts at $799, and the 12.9-inch model starts at $1,099.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="g17dqO"&gt;Apple debuted a completely redesigned iMac that also has the M1 chip. It’s really thin, has a 24-inch screen, a 1080p FaceTime camera, and comes in seven different colors. They’ll also come with a new wireless keyboard that includes Touch ID for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PdqL3"&gt;You can buy the new iMac in four colors starting at $1,299 and in seven colors and better specs starting at $1,499. You can order it starting on April 30th, and it will be available in the second half of May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Y6n88W"&gt;At long last, Apple took the wraps off its long-rumored AirTag item trackers, which you can track in the Find My app. You can customize your AirTag with emoji, too. You’ll be able to preorder them on Friday for $29, and they’ll be available on April 30th. You can also get a four-pack for $99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches new iPad Pro with M1 processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RThDKKvsa37AWzXULQcYRLpf3Bw=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157640/lcimg_06ebca85_7eac_4c32_9e8f_4b98fad99ec8.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rquOpZ"&gt;Right on schedule, Apple has launched the next generation of its iPad Pro. As was the case with the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s improvements to the iPad Pro are largely on the inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELYssq"&gt;The device has a new eight-core M1 processor, the same chip that powers the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini. Apple claims this will deliver “a big jump in performance” over the previous generation. The graphics performance is over 1,500 times faster, per the company. The chip brings a number of new features, including a “next-generation 16-core Apple Neural engine” and an advanced image signal processor. Apple also says you can expect up to 10 hours of battery life from Wi-Fi models and nine hours from Wi-Fi + Cellular models. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BdPe4hhuUM-Pj_1LqM5XMsHCmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457435/lcimg_5b9a9e8b_c6d0_48da_8f7c_ad8d1086a21e.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yzNQb8"&gt;The iPad Pro now supports Thunderbolt 3 and USB4, as well as millimeter-wave 5G connectivity. Apple says the tablet will offer “the broadest 5G coverage worldwide,” reaching speeds up to 4Gbps, and will support eSIM. The company didn’t mention its U1 locator chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnRj5d"&gt;There’s an improved camera as well. Apple says the ISP and LIDAR scanner will capture “incredible details” in low-light conditions. There’s a TrueDepth camera system on the front of the device, which allows users to unlock it with facial recognition. The system includes a new 12MP ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view. The camera will automatically pan to follow you around during video calls with a new feature called Center Stage. Some smart displays, such as the Facebook Portal, offer similar features. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcy6M1ba7uE9QKhvYmwwnbhDRy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457520/lcimg_80056320_9cae_41a0_ae7b_242b83419310.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XACejP"&gt;The iPad Pro will support the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio, as well as the Magic Keyboard, which is available in a new white color. On the gaming front, it also supports PS5 and Xbox controllers with haptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miSm1Q"&gt;Apple says the device uses a 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosure. The magnets in the enclosure and the speakers include 100 percent “recycled rare earth elements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQW9Ys"&gt;The iPad comes in two sizes: an 11-inch option and a 12.9-inch option, with starting weights of 1.03 pounds and 1.5 pounds respectively. You can configure both with up to 16GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. They ship with a one-meter USB-C charging cable and a 20W USB-C power adapter. The 11-inch model has a 28.65 watt-hour battery, and the larger device has a 40.88 watt-hour battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQsAai"&gt;The 12.9-inch iPad models also include a new Mini LED screen, the Liquid Retina XDR, which Apple says delivers “XDR-level brightness.” The 2732 x 2048 display includes 10,000 Mini LEDs and will reach up to 1,000 nits of brightness and a 1 million-to-one contrast ratio, Apple claims. This component has run Apple into some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;supply chain issues&lt;/a&gt; recently — one manufacturer has reportedly paused production. (The 11-incher comes with a regular Liquid Retina display with 2388 x 1688 resolution, which maxes out at 600 nits of brightness.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzPaq_lDc873Jt4LnGCdsIGCfEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457518/lcimg_34fb76c1_9a66_47dd_b873_8be9a156eda3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ksncYk"&gt;The 11-inch model starts at $799 (Wi-Fi) and $999 (Wi-Fi + Cellular), and the 12.9-inch one begins at $1,099 (Wi-Fi) and $1,299 (Wi-Fi + Cellular). Education pricing is also available: college students can get the 11-inch model for $749 and the 12.9-inch model for $999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9r32RI"&gt;Both models will be available in the second half of May, with preorders going live on April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces thinner iMac with M1 chip and bright colors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing all seven colors of the new iMac: green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and silver." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01Hwl_PP17A1y5ukMWlyzLOqhrk=/168x0:1977x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157337/apple_new_imac_spring21_hero_04202021_Full_Bleed_Image.jpg.medium_2x.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The redesigned iMac will be available in seven colors. | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sq8H0d"&gt;Apple introduced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fimac-24%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394034%2Fapple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt; today with a slimmer display, an Apple Silicon chip, and a case with bright, bold colors that throws back to the classic colorful all-in-one iMacs. Apple said the new iMac was designed from the ground up for the M1 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIOw47"&gt;The new iMac has a 24-inch, 4.5K display with narrower borders around the top and sides. It still has a large chin on the bottom, but the rear of the display is now flat instead of curved. Apple says the volume has been reduced by over 50 percent. The screen also has Apple’s True Tone tech for automatically adjusting the color temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2UaH0"&gt;Apple is also promising a &lt;em&gt;much-needed&lt;/em&gt; update to the iMac’s camera and mics so you’ll look better on video calls. It now has a 1080p resolution and a larger sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vBqQtn2TnunAHOFBpmejKafs6jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457424/138_2021_04_20_138_vlcscreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3TpU4"&gt;The new iMac is 11.5mm thin, but Apple says it should stay quieter and cooler than the previous model, thanks to the M1 chip. The new model has “two small fans” replacing the “bulky thermal system” of the previous-generation iMac, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLfmyU"&gt;There’s also a new magnetic power cable — it sounds a lot like the old MagSafe cable — that attaches to the back. Ethernet can be connected to the power brick and delivered through the same cable. The entry-level model will come with two USB-C / Thunderbolt ports on the back, and a higher-end model will add an additional two USB-C ports (without Thunderbolt support). Incredibly, there is still a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kyl_EpPGEaCRytGqLTd0JvdFwfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457431/134_2021_04_20_134_vlcscreen.jpg"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAJ5wTLC_RgDjCr2RsFxDoM6SVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457430/133_2021_04_20_133_vlcscreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8xsXTSL-vxu_sxA3ze71X7TFFg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457429/132_2021_04_20_132_vlcscreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Omd2LX"&gt;Alongside the new iMac, Apple is also introducing a keyboard, mouse, and trackpad in colors to match. The keyboard has a Touch ID button for logging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzLG3b"&gt;The new iMac starts at $1,299, though some of the colors are reserved for the higher-end $1,499 model. It’ll be available in the second half of May, with orders &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fimac-features-all-new-design-in-vibrant-colors-m1-chip-and-45k-retina-display%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394034%2Fapple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting April 30th&lt;/a&gt;. There are seven color options total. The base model comes with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD; it can be upgraded to include up to 16GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfXZ5X"&gt;This is the first iMac to switch to Apple Silicon, the chips that Apple has been designing in-house. The company first added an Apple Silicon chip to the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini in November. Apple plans to eventually roll out these Arm-based chips to its entire Mac line. While the transition means that macOS software needs to be updated to support the new chips, so far the trade-offs have been worth it. The first generation of M1 Macs have been extremely well-received, with the new chips offering improved power and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ted Lasso season 2 is coming in July, and it looks as charming as ever</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PoY09O"&gt;Apple’s event today was full of hardware and new products, but the company also took some time to have fun by unveiling a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season. The show — which stars Jason Sudeikis as a perpetually positive football coach who takes on a gig helming an English soccer team — has been one of the breakout hits on Apple TV Plus, the company’s fledgling streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="beiCR8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I always hear the question: who let the dogs out (who who who who)? With respect to The Baha Men, I prefer WHEN let the dogs out (when when when when)? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Cause guess what, Greyhounds? Our 2nd season starts 7/23! Can I get a Bah Amen!? That’s what I used to think they were called&lt;/p&gt;— Ted Lasso (@TedLasso) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TedLasso/status/1384556102856024073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k4wX62"&gt;Season 2 follows Lasso as he leads AFC Richmond during a season of turmoil, with the club recently relegated to a lower league. That said, it looks just as charming as season 1, with plenty of folksy expressions and largely the same cast of beloved characters. Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; will debut on July 23rd. No word on whether &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2021/4/19/22391172/european-super-league-announcement-tearing-soccer-apart"&gt;the controversial European Super League&lt;/a&gt; will be a plot point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USBeLY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22148310"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apple “Spring Loaded” live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple unveils a redesigned remote for its new Apple TV 4K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ZlNorpb2ByNkPP15vvxDBKbkJE=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157146/WcGeQVXeT3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g60avE"&gt;The Apple TV remote is one of the weakest parts of the company’s set-top box, and Apple is, at last, addressing it today. The company just unveiled a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-unveils-the-next-generation-of-apple-tv-4k%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F18277449%2Fapple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;redesigned Siri remote&lt;/a&gt; alongside its new Apple TV 4K. You’ll get the new remote with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"&gt;new $179 4K set-top box&lt;/a&gt;, or it’s available separately for $59. As well as being compatible with the new Apple TV 4K, it also works with the 2017 model and Apple TV HD. Apple will also sell the remote bundled with the Apple TV HD for $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4OhwO"&gt;The new Siri remote has an iPod-style scroll wheel, a five-way click pad, touch controls, a mute button, and a power button that can turn your TV on and off. Meanwhile, the Siri button is now on the side of the remote, and Apple says that the voice assistant now works on Apple TV in Austria, Ireland, and New Zealand, in addition to the 13 countries where it was already supported. Finally, the new Siri remote’s enclosure is made out of 100 percent recycled aluminum. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D0bMiw6aqFs4DQELBC2-fnrjS-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457422/Apple_unveils_the_next_gen_of_AppleTV4K_042021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new remote alongside the new Apple TV 4K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QYtvOK"&gt;The new remote was unveiled alongside Apple’s updated Apple TV 4K box, which has a more powerful processor that can support high-frame rate HDR content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubLEaC"&gt;Although the build quality and looks of the existing set-top box’s remote have never been lacking, people have had no shortage of complaints about its functionality. For one, its size can be too small to be used comfortably, and it’s also super easy to lose. Design-wise, it’s annoyingly symmetrical, so half the time, you’re likely to pick it up the wrong way if you’re not careful. Many of these issues look like they’ve been addressed with the new remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yypdBY"&gt;Yes, you’ve always been able to replace the Apple TV’s remote with a universal remote or use an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/1/12344908/apple-tv-remote-app-iphone-released"&gt;app on your phone&lt;/a&gt; to control the set-top box. But for those who just want a better first-party remote, here is that solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8fzGh"&gt;The new remote will be available alongside the new Apple TV 4K, which can be preordered starting April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new Apple TV 4K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NPFSzjL4R20vNldYJVfuFbVIjUU=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157139/Apple_unveils_the_next_gen_of_AppleTV4K_042021.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Apple TV 4K with redesigned remote&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IQ2lHr"&gt;Apple has just announced a new Apple TV streaming box, replacing the Apple TV 4K that came out in 2017. The new model retains the name of the prior model but comes with a more powerful A12 Bionic chip that lets it play HDR video at higher frame rates. It’s also powerful enough to support 60fps Dolby Vision playback over AirPlay from a compatible iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mNwFG"&gt;The old Apple TV 4K, which has been Apple’s flagship set-top box for four years, supports 4K streaming as well as HDR, including Dolby Vision. It also supports Dolby Atmos sound codecs. But it doesn’t support 120Hz refresh rates, which might be important should you ever want to play serious games on an Apple TV. It also has the most notoriously bad remote control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CreNyM"&gt;Fortunately, Apple has completely redesigned the remote for the new Apple TV 4K with an improved, more ergonomic design and more capabilities. The new remote is thicker than the prior model, has a new five-way touch controller in place of the maligned swipe pad of the original, and a proper power button to turn off your TV. The Siri search button has been moved to the side of the remote, under your right thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3i6vpuVKuIckJS1BlJrUFry77Ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457338/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_1.17.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ObEznr"&gt;Apple did not redesign the Apple TV box itself; it remains a squircle-shaped puck that you have to put on a shelf or entertainment center, unlike the dongle designs that many of Apple’s competitors use now. A new feature allows the Apple TV to optimize the colors of your TV screen using the light sensor on an iPhone. Apple says it is working with a number of content providers to produce high frame rate HDR content for the new Apple TV, including Fox Sports, NBCUniversal, Paramount Plus, Red Bull TV, and Canal Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLsQ0H"&gt;The new Apple TV 4K starts at $179 for 32GB of storage and will be available to purchase starting on April 30th. A 64GB model will also be available for $199. Apple is also selling the older Apple TV HD, which is limited to 1080p resolution, with the new remote for $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11gKdi"&gt;All of those prices are a lot higher than Apple’s competitors, such as Amazon, Google, and Roku. Apple is betting once again that people will pay for performance and ecosystem in a set-top box and is charging a hefty premium for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hQrN7O4IFVm1aj9wteZlwIoAM5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457346/image__1_.png"&gt;
