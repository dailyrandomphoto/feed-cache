    <title>How to preorder the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKF7xFC4hTYRm-7tz1b73WWCeWk=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857848/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the colors of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIBU9V"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;a fleet of new products at its “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;. Chief among them — you guessed it — was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. This one is coming in various sizes and colors, but with smaller notches, the new A15 Bionic chipset, and with redesigned and improved cameras located around the back. Going from smallest to largest, Apple will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and finally the iPhone 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;With the Pro and Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be able to get the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage, along with 120Hz refresh rate displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1YGEt"&gt;If you’re looking forward to ordering any of the four iPhone 13 models, the good news is you can preorder now, and it should arrive on release day, which is Friday, September 24th. Based on years prior, the ship date can slip later if you order them closer to release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIozlV"&gt;If you’re curious about all of the options and how much it’ll all cost, we’ve listed all of that info below for buying unlocked. All of the carrier-specific promos, including trade-in deals, are listed at the bottom of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7zyyJ"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7E96Ug"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is the 2021 iteration on the Mini phone form factor with a 5.4-inch OLED screen. Apple says that this newer version should get better battery life than the previous model. Battery life was one of the few disappointments in the iPhone 12 Mini, so it’s good that Apple seems to have made improvements here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytXyfk"&gt;Apple will offer the iPhone 13 Mini starting with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $729&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to opt for more storage with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; versions for $829 or $1,029, respectively. If you purchase through a carrier via Apple’s site, the starting price of each configuration drops $30, starting at $699. If you want to trade in your phone, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check for its value right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nPdN53"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DVnDHN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 has a 6.1-inch OLED display, the same size as last year’s model. Like other models this year, Apple upgraded the internal chipset to the A15 Bionic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NHlw2"&gt;Preorders will begin Friday, September 17th at Apple. Buying them unlocked will cost you $30 more than buying through a carrier, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $829 for the 128GB version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$929 for the 256GB version&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,129 for the 512GB version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGvHEm"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find out your phone’s value at Apple&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in for credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BaJlBq"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eBv8ru"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are the biggest and most capable models coming out of Apple in 2021. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch OLED display with an A15 Bionic chipset, while the Pro Max has a bigger 6.7-inch OLED. Both support up to 120Hz refresh rate, which is an improvement that’s long been anticipated. However, you’ll also pay a lot more for this model than the base iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAUxcl"&gt;At Apple, the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models start at $999 and $1,099, respectively. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; will run you $1,099, while the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; will cost $1,199. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration&lt;/a&gt; of either model will also cost an extra $200, with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,499 and the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,599. Unlike the iPhone 13 Mini and standard iPhone 13, there’s no $30 price difference if you choose to purchase the Pro line unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHpfYv"&gt;As mentioned before, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s site can tell you how much your current phone is worth&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wmtN87"&gt;iPhone 13 lineup carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jzmr1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; Current and new Verizon users can save on any of the iPhone 13 models with a trade-in if you’re on certain unlimited plans, billed back to you in monthly credits over the course of 24 or 30 months. New customers can get an additional $500 worth in credits by switching carriers to Verizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74PqP"&gt;How much you’ll get in trade-in credit varies depending on the phone you want, with up to $1,000 back in billing credits if you buy the iPhone 13 Pro Max and have an unlimited plan. If you’re after the 128GB iPhone 13 Pro that usually costs $999, trading in select phones can make it free after you’ve received billing credits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n71NlO"&gt;If you want the iPhone 13, Verizon will offer those on an unlimited plan up to $800 for a trade-in, and you’ll get reimbursed via billing credits. For an iPhone 13 Mini, trade in values cap at $700.  &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.verizon.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKEbcd"&gt;According to a Verizon spokesperson, these are the phones that will get the most amount of trade-in value (though the carrier will accept most phones in any condition, but battery damage is a deal-breaker): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vp61Ou"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3SAWq"&gt;These are the mid-tier devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xce8xP"&gt;Apple: iPhone X and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u4VbAe"&gt;Samsung: GS9 and Note 9 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OSmNtc"&gt;Google: Pixel 4A and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lcmacj"&gt;Kyocera: DuraForce Ultra &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5PQFGX"&gt;LG: V50 ThinQ and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3IkQLY"&gt;Motorola: Moto One 5G, RAZR, Edge Plus &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FgPHff"&gt;Nokia: 8 V 5G &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a1j0LX"&gt;OnePlus: 7 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UxtFME"&gt;Sony: Xperia 1 and up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jp0kUn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; New and existing T-Mobile users can get up to $800 in trade-in credit toward an iPhone 13 series phone. This deal is available for customers on the Max plan, and you’ll get the credit paid back to you in 30 monthly bill credits. T-Mobile’s “Forever Upgrade” initiative will let Max plan holders get up to $800 in trade-in credit for future trade-ins, including this one. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-iphone-deals%2Fupgrade-benefits&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665165%2Fapple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit T-Mobile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nQiuJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; New and current AT&amp;amp;T subscribers on an unlimited plan who trade in a phone, then purchase an iPhone 13 series phone on an installment plan can get a good deal after all of the billing credits have come in. You can get up to $1,000 in billing credits if you trade in a phone that’s worth $180 or higher, making the iPhone 13 Pro Max a better deal. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-128gb-silver.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPad Mini doesn’t support mmWave 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGWfi-7rfT3vKeFYmomSsjIqsYQ=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69870020/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pXwYQN"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;newly redesigned iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most exciting announcements at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665413/apple-event-iphone-13-announcements-news-products"&gt;iPhone 13 event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, but in the aftermath a limitation has been identified: As spotted by &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/09/a-few-extra-notes-about-apples-september-14-event/"&gt;Jason Snell from &lt;em&gt;Six Colors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the new iPad Mini doesn’t support mmWave 5G. There’s also a hint that its new A15 Bionic processor might be downclocked in comparison to the version that appears in the iPhone 13 line (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/ipad-mini-downclocked-a15-chip/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via&lt;em&gt; MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YycHZt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;Support for 5G&lt;/a&gt; on the cellular version of the iPad Mini was one of Apple’s major highlights, but &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/specs/#:~:text=Cellular%20and%20Wireless,eSIM6"&gt;looking at Apple’s tech specs&lt;/a&gt;, while it supports low- and mid-band 5G, it doesn’t offer mmWave. Apple first started playing into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;the 5G hype machine with the launch of the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, and continues to tout the faster download and upload speeds the tech can offer in 2021. You can see the cellular and wireless features Apple highlights for the iPad Mini below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/99E7IPl1KKw5jgEzdgI3kaUbB-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22856329/Screenshot_2021_09_16_3.08.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s breakdown of the cellular components in the new iPad Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dHCZuL"&gt;Getting fast 5G speeds is dependent on coverage, which has improved in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;but isn’t always faster than LTE&lt;/a&gt;. Carriers like&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt; Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325857/t-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; have big plans to improve 5G performance in 2021 — including increasing the availability of fast mmWave — but where coverage is limited, it might not be worth the trouble yet. In our experience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;reviewing the iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, mmWave was finnicky. Here’s &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s editor-in-chief Nilay Patel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="fi7JWy"&gt;In a patch of 20 glorious square feet, I pulled over 2 gigabits per second down. (And 40 megabits per second up, which matched regular 5G.) If I walked 100 feet away, the signal dropped, and that was that. I hope you are not anticipating being very mobile with your 5G mobile phone if you have giant files to download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="99G09n"&gt;Maybe not a huge loss for the Mini just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJ66b7"&gt;The same might be said for the iPad Mini’s processor. The GeekBench benchmarks &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/ipad-mini-downclocked-a15-chip/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; cites&lt;/a&gt; points to the Mini’s performance &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/9851750"&gt;coming in at 2.9 GHz&lt;/a&gt;, a bit slower than the 3.2 GHz the publication sourced for the iPhone 13. However, GeekBench is not the be-all-end-all for understanding the performance of a device. Without an iPad Mini to test in hand, there’s no way to be absolutely certain those numbers are accurate. It’s also not too difficult to fake a GeekBench score, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-xl-5g-fake/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; has proven&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yWwXm"&gt;If you’re looking for an actual verifiable difference between the new Mini and iPhones, look to graphics performance. The iPad Mini offers five graphics cores, one more than the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini’s 4-core GPU. There’s no way to tell what that looks like until we review it, but the mmWave-less iPad Mini might still be plenty capable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The bitter lawsuit hanging over the Apple Watch’s new swipe keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lf7t7XTCie4KES3CJ5bsAFEKnWQ=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869170/3tX1ydZgxW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, Apple really did type “copy” into its own keyboard during the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple allegedly offered to buy his app; instead, it’s being Sherlocked&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7J0PhN"&gt;In January 2019, Kosta Eleftheriou had every reason to believe Apple was about to make a deal, his lawsuit alleges. Apple’s head of keyboards &lt;em&gt;loved &lt;/em&gt;his FlickType keyboard app for the Apple Watch, gushing over how few mistakes it made. “Apple should buy this from you,” the man exclaimed, saying it “could be a key feature for the watch.” He demoed it for the Apple Watch team on January 24th, where a senior engineer allegedly gushed too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlJd8e"&gt;That evening, Eleftheriou received a message from Apple, but not the one he expected. In the course of one afternoon, the company had seemingly decided that Apple Watch keyboards were against the rules. “Specifically, the app is a keyboard for Apple Watch. For this reason, your app will be removed from sale on the App Store at this time,” Apple wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0RHrV"&gt;This Tuesday, Apple revealed its own swipe keyboard app alongside the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmmCZf"&gt;Eleftheriou had been Sherlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cN0A7V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So now we know. See you in court, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hJtPI2Z83J"&gt;https://t.co/hJtPI2Z83J&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1s7MUSLTpc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1s7MUSLTpc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1437845736951992321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dvc5W8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sherlocked&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DS3fQr"&gt;He’s far from the first. Apple has a long history of looking to its own app developers for inspiration, copying their ideas, and integrating them into its own operating systems for free. (It’s called “Sherlocking” because Apple famously copied a lot of features from the third-party Watson app over to its Sherlock desktop search tool in 2002; here are some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18651190/apple-ios-13-mac-os-catalina-third-party-apps-products-copy-wwdc-2019"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17428598/ios-12-apps-features-third-party-clones-bitmoji-houseparty"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133023/apple-bluemail-blix-restored-mac-app-store-sherlocking-patent-lawsuit"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zfBkO"&gt;But this isn’t your typical case of whether a developer should be entitled to their income or whether users deserve the functionality for free — and not just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1437899751496769541"&gt;because Apple’s making users pay for a new Watch to get it&lt;/a&gt;.  When Apple blocked his app two years ago and continued to tussle with him over updates, the company made an enemy of Eleftheriou. He’s become one of Apple’s most vocal critics, developing a reputation as a scam hunter. He continually and effectively points out that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;Apple is terrible at keeping out frauds&lt;/a&gt; which bilk ordinary users out of outrageous sums of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BLa2oV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching the most egregious scams","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"},{"title":"Eight things Apple could do to prove it actually cares about App Store users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TpIt0S"&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he filed a lawsuit against the company over his app&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the company continued to reject and hold up his Apple Watch keyboard for months in an attempt to force him to sell it to Apple for cheap. “Evidently, Apple thought Plaintiff would simply give up and sell its application to Apple at a discount,” &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/499290311/Kpaw-LLC-v-Apple-Inc#from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22100421__t_w__r_google.com__d_D"&gt;the complaint reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEjYab"&gt;Here’s the part where you might be thinking: “Wait, didn’t Apple ban every keyboard app for the Apple Watch back in 2019?” or “Didn’t Eleftheriou just tweet that rejection message and say ‘see you in court’ a couple days ago?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXLYTJ"&gt;The timeline’s a little confusing, it’s true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SL6Hu"&gt;Yes, Eleftheriou filed his suit nearly six full months before the Apple Watch Series 7 announcement. It’s not clear what impact the Sherlocking might have on the suit, and he won’t say. His lawyers are advising him against saying too much to journalists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MwCU4u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s untangle the timeline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0szggv"&gt;But no, Apple didn’t actually reject every Apple Watch keyboard app in 2019 — Eleftheriou believes his app was singled out for this treatment. &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shift-keyboard-swipe-type/id1452694750"&gt;Shift Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; had already arrived in February 2019, and even partner apps that included Eleftheriou’s keyboard tech (the complaint names Nano for Reddit, Chirp for Twitter and Lens for Instagram) allegedly made it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkarpU"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it changed its mind over time. Originally, the company didn’t think it was appropriate for a keyboard to take up the entirety of the Apple Watch’s small screen, but decided differently in 2019 after it saw the potential and says it’s encouraged Apple Watch keyboards ever since. The company basically admits that removing Eleftheriou’s app was a mistake, and claims it quickly corrected the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jM85i"&gt;But Eleftheriou disputes that last point, saying it took a year of appeals and resubmissions to get his keyboard back onto the store. “From [January 2019] on, I was simultaneously discussing a FlickType acquisition with them, while also being rejected,” he tells me. And Apple initially made it look like those appeals failed, too. “The App Review Board evaluated your app and determined that the original rejection feedback is valid. Please note that all appeal results are final,” reads Eleftheriou from a message he received in May 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJC81x"&gt;In the complaint, he alleges it wasn’t until January 2020, a year after the surprise takedown, that his Apple Watch keyboard extension was approved. When FlickType for Apple Watch did finally arrive, it became the number one paid app in the entire store, pulled in $130,000 in its first month, he claims, and was named &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/"&gt;one of Apple’s top paid apps of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. That’s what he’s using as grounds that he’s been financially harmed in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GnWbN"&gt;Not that he’s necessarily too worried about finances right now. “The FlickType income, yeah, I do expect it to eventually disappear given that the functionality will now be built-in,” he says, casually. “I don’t have a day job, but yeah this isn’t a big financial problem for me,” he adds when I ask. I wonder if he made good money &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pinterest-acquires-team-that-builtfleksy-inc-1466021492"&gt;when he sold his keyboard company Fleksy to Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; roughly five years ago. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/2/10900456/microsoft-swiftkey-acquisition-reported-250-million"&gt;Microsoft bought keyboard app SwiftKey for roughly $250 million&lt;/a&gt; just months earlier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll0yzt"&gt;Eleftheriou says FlickType has “mostly been a hobby,” but his other hobby — hunting down scam apps and calling out the App Store’s failings — stems from this whole situation, too. He was fed up watching competing apps thrive, including scams, after his own had been blocked by App Review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXy0HE"&gt;And last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627515/flicktype-ios-keyboard-discontinued-blind-visually-impaired"&gt;Eleftheriou publicly gave up on his popular iPhone keyboard extension for the blind&lt;/a&gt; after one too many rejections, due to what he describes as the latest misunderstanding by Apple’s App Review team of how his app (and the company’s own VoiceOver screen reader technology) are supposed to work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8n3rg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's with a heavy heart today that we're announcing the discontinuation of our award-winning iPhone keyboard for blind users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple has thrown us obstacle after obstacle for years while we try to provide an app to improve people's lives, and we can no longer endure their abuse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cH1HCQzeP1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cH1HCQzeP1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292830523744257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CRdQ69"&gt;“Our rejection history already spans more than FOURTY [sic] pages filled with repeated, unwarranted, &amp;amp; unreasonable rejections that serve to frustrate &amp;amp; delay rather than benefit end-users. And dealing with App Review isn’t just time-consuming. It’s also very emotionally draining,” he wrote at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1BPQm"&gt;Apple effectively tells me this, too, was a mistake on its part. The company says it now realizes the keyboard does in fact comply with its guidelines, has explained that to Eleftheriou several times, and has repeatedly encouraged him to submit the app again. Apple would prefer that he doesn’t take it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8H7idJ"&gt;But Eleftheriou says he’s had enough. Here’s the statement he sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="65BG7X"&gt;I will be delighted to bring back the accessible FlickType Keyboard for iPhone when Apple finally fixes their broken 3rd-party keyboard APIs on iOS and allows developers to fairly compete with Apple’s own keyboard. They must also ensure that every single reviewer has basic VoiceOver training - we keep getting rejections due to reviewers not knowing or even understanding how to use VoiceOver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMSeyl"&gt;I’ve already poured thousands of hours developing my app, working around countless keyboard API issues and dealing with app review, so I’m really looking forward to Apple’s improvements and will promptly re-submit the FlickType VoiceOver keyboard when sufficient progress has been made in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrE2Qb"&gt;As a separate note, I’m also calling on Apple to allow developers to access their own rejection history. Apple currently hides this from developers and even refuses to provide it upon request. It’s unacceptable that Apple will send us rejection messages that disappear shortly after, with no way to access them ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KGCtwr"&gt;He’s particularly annoyed with how Apple’s own keyboard has an unfair advantage since it doesn’t need to use its own APIs, and how those APIs are lacking features &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1430271507305881600"&gt;that Apple publicly promised years ago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQepWa"&gt;Technically, Eleftheriou is the one making the iPhone keyboard extension disappear, not Apple. It still exists in the current version on the store. He submitted a new version that removes the extension, one that’s currently pending with Apple’s App Review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rdnJxC"&gt;For now, Eleftheriou is going to take his keyboard and go home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A short history of every time Apple CEO Tim Cook praised augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BFSuuOJCdScY2AnKMm3g_j2QVS4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69848232/tim-cook-apple-stock-0563.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cook has been singing the praises of AR for five years&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ERzUQ0"&gt;Tim Cook has just marked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;10 years as Apple’s CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and while he’s grown Apple into the most valuable company in the world, it’s reasonable to argue he hasn’t yet introduced a signature, industry shaking product like Apple co-founder Steve Jobs did with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqO7Qo"&gt;But if you’ve been following Apple for a minute, you’ve probably heard Cook talk about the game-changing potential of augmented reality. While he once said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/28/4374482/tim-cook-apple-wearable-google-glass"&gt;hard to see the appeal of Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;, the AR wearable that proved unpopular with consumers, he’s held a consistently positive opinion on AR since at least 2016. While most of the industry was putting all its eggs in the VR basket, Cook repeatedly expressed support for what he views as the far superior AR. This would become a running theme: AR good, VR not so good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3j429"&gt;It seems likely that AR may become the hallmark of Cook’s tenure, as long as Apple executes on a winning idea. While that’s not exactly guaranteed — Apple has yet to unveil an AR headset or glasses — Cook’s frequent comments about the tech keep the topic in the news and reassure investors and customers that Apple is working on it. In September 2021, he went as far as to call himself “AR fan number one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZIIDx"&gt;AR features are already available on the iPhone and iPad. And while hope is starting to fade that Apple will release a mixed reality device in 2022, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;latest rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; the company is still forging ahead with some kind of AR / VR headset to be released in the not-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jIE1"&gt;Here’s a brief history of all the times Tim Cook said he was convinced AR was the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LR10VY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook says in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/26/12290920/apple-augmented-reality-ar-tim-cook"&gt;quarterly earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that “AR can be really great.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX7rQO"&gt;“We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run, we think there’s great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. The number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers’ kind of products like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, that’s why you see so many iPhones in the wild chasing pokemons.” (Cook pronounces it “pokey-mans.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3BaXv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-prefers-augmented-reality/story?id=42064913"&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview that he believes AR is a bigger deal than VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtE9kB"&gt;“There’s virtual reality and there’s augmented reality — both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEwdho"&gt;AR “gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things — visually — for both of us to see. Maybe it’s something we’re talking about, maybe it’s someone else here who’s not here present but who can be made to appear to be present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WB8GUn"&gt;“There’s a lot of really cool things there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqvA1V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook makes a brief mention of AR in a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2016/08/13/tim-cook-the-interview-running-apple-is-sort-of-a-lonely-job/?utm_term=.71cfafb58188"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt;: “I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfFqeu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;In an appearance at Utah Tech Tour, Cook goes into detail about &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/02/tim-cook-talks-steve-jobs-need-for-encryption-at-utah-tech-tour-video/"&gt;how crucial AR may become&lt;/a&gt; and why he views it as superior to VR — while stressing that AR presents significant technology challenges before it can be adopted for mass consumerism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="s4U9pW"&gt;In terms of it becoming a mass adoption [phenomenon], so that, say, everyone in here would have an AR experience, the reality to do that, it has to be something that everyone in here views to be an “acceptable thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE5O2T"&gt;And nobody in here, few people in here, think it’s acceptable to be tethered to a computer walking in here and sitting down, few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something, because we’re all social people at heart. Even introverts are social people, we like people and we want to interact. It has to be that it’s likely that AR, of the two, is the one the largest number of people will engage with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyxSDF"&gt;I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you, a lot of us live on our smartphones, the iPhone, I hope, is very important for everyone, so AR will become really big. VR I think is not going to be that big, compared to AR. I’m not saying it’s not important, it is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mfq3v"&gt;I’m excited about VR from an education point of view, I think it can be really big for education, I think it can be very big for games. But I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me. But I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now, if the technology was there, which it’s not today. How long will it take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wx2VTE"&gt;AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there. But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="o5nJLd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkV78RZ73Mw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6ivZT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-virtual-reality-theres-no-substitute-f#.qel1aEjdb"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while “VR has some interesting applications,” AR is superior to VR because “there’s no substitute for human contact. And so you want the technology to encourage that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LWV7WX"&gt;Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might ... have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. ... You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8zwWMG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2017: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-tim-cook-boss-brexit-uk-theresa-may-number-10-interview-ustwo-a7574086.html"&gt;expands his thoughts on AR’s potential&lt;/a&gt;, adding a new comparison: AR is a big idea, like the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qlZDkX"&gt;I’m excited about augmented reality because unlike virtual reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what’s happening presently. Most people don’t want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can’t do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHlQnM"&gt;I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that’s why I get so excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ywuu2K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-15/apple-s-tim-cook-on-donald-trump-the-homepod-and-the-legacy-of-steve-jobs"&gt;wide-ranging interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook details his vision for AR at Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b2MVpL"&gt;I think it is profound. I am so excited about it, I just want to yell out and scream. The first step in making it a mainstream kind of experience is to put it in the operating system. We’re building it into iOS 11, opening it to ­developers—and unleashing the creativity of millions of people. Even we can’t predict what’s going to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5fDe2"&gt;There’s some things that you can already get a vision of. We’ve talked to IKEA, and they have 3D images of their furniture line. You’re talking about changing the whole experience of how you shop for, in this case, furniture and other objects that you can place around the home. You can take that idea and begin to think this is something that stretches from enterprise to consumer. There’s not a lot of things that do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hboXPl"&gt;You’ll see things happening in enterprises where AR is ­fundamental to what they’re doing. You’re going to see some consumer things that are unbelievably cool. Can we do everything we want to do now? No. The technology’s not complete yet. But that’s the beauty to a certain degree. This has a runway. And it’s an incredible runway. It’s time to put the seat belt on and go. When people begin to see what’s possible, it’s going to get them very excited—like we are, like we’ve been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DIea6k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; At an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590323"&gt;event at Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, Cook responds to a student who asks what technology he would consider “transformative.” Cook says there are widespread uses for AR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYUKHM"&gt;“I’m incredibly excited by AR because I can see uses for it everywhere. I can see uses for it in education, in consumers, in entertainment, in sports. I can see it in every business that I know anything about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JpVYm"&gt;“I also like the fact that it doesn’t isolate. I don’t like our products being used a lot. I like our products amplifying thoughts and I think AR can help amplify the human connection. I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite. There are clearly some cool niche things for VR but it’s not profound in my view. AR is profound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJlluP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In an &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-future-of-fashion-augmented-reality"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vogue UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says while Apple wasn’t looking to build a “giant database of clothes,” it would support companies in the AR space who were doing this work. “If you think about a runway show in the fashion world, that’s a great application of AR because some of these, you want to see the dress all the way around, you do not want to just see the front,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, noting how many runway shows are livestreamed and not just visible to an in-person audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBEvu6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;introduction of its ARKit platform on iOS 11&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says in a quarterly earnings call that &lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/the-transcript-of-todays-opening-statement-from-apples-ceo-on-fiscal-q4-2017-is-now-available.html"&gt;Apple has created&lt;/a&gt; the world’s largest augmented reality platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GdJYqz"&gt;There already are over a thousand apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of app aimed at consumers, students and business users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RV7Y54"&gt;Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever. We’re already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine from the human body to the solar system. And of course you experience them like you’re really there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je9Rb6"&gt;Instantly education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase – or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to change everything&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DM0tys"&gt;This is not quite what came to pass (more on that later). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJAyaa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-ARKit launch, Cook admits he &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-iphone-tim-cook-interview-features-new-augmented-reality-ar-arkit-a7993566.html"&gt;thinks AR technology&lt;/a&gt; for headsets or glasses isn’t yet up to par as far as Apple is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag0KHY"&gt;“I can tell you the technology itself doesn’t exist to do that in a quality way. The display technology required, as well as putting enough stuff around your face — there’s huge challenges with that. The field of view, the quality of the display itself, it’s not there yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMoVt4"&gt;“We don’t give a rat’s about being first, we want to be the best, and give people a great experience. But now anything you would see on the market any time soon would not be something any of us would be satisfied with. Nor do I think the vast majority of people would be satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvKmAY"&gt;“Most technology challenges can be solved, but it’s a matter of how long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiQf8M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/02/01/apple-inc-appl-q1-2018-earnings-conference-call-tr.aspx"&gt;Apple’s Q1 earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Cook describes “great excitement” around augmented reality among customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5QNWq"&gt;“Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices, and with ARKit, we’re giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yOGiC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;NowThisNews&lt;/em&gt; during an interview about Apple’s Watch that AR is poised to become indispensable. “I think that one day we will wonder how we ever lived without it,” Cook says of AR. “We can have a much more enhanced conversation with the power of AR.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZOOfV"&gt;“The future is now,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EZs5TM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vX9xBB_vBsc?rel=0&amp;amp;start=433" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VO88JU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2020: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/tim-cook-ar-war-ducks-healthtech"&gt;Cook tells an audience in Dublin, Ireland&lt;/a&gt; that augmented reality “is the next big thing” and that it will “pervade our entire lives.” He gives an example of a company using AR and described its potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImgYq0"&gt;Yesterday, I visited a development company called War Ducks … in Dublin – 15 people and they’re staffing up and using AR for games. You can imagine, for games it’s incredible but even for our discussion here. You and I might be talking about an article and using AR we can pull it up, and can both be looking at the same thing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDw6RA"&gt;I think it’s something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5lTJJO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2021:&lt;/strong&gt; During an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;interview with journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; Cook agreed with her that augmented reality is “a critically important part of Apple’s future.” He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsfUXn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2021:&lt;/strong&gt; In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/UU6MtPwT_5c?t=547"&gt;an interview with tech YouTuber iJustine&lt;/a&gt;, Cook said that he was AR’s number one fan and reiterated his hopes for it as a collaboration tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nqOlVs"&gt;I am so excited about AR. I think AR is one of these very few profound technologies that we will look back on one day and went, how did we live our lives without it? And so right now you can experience it in thousands of ways using your iPad or your iPhone, but of course, those will get better and better over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfPD0k"&gt;Already it’s a great way to shop, it’s a great way to learn. It enhances the learning process. I can’t wait for it to be even more important in collaboration and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBwShJ"&gt;So I’m AR fan number one. I think it’s that big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoCvwM"&gt;After a comment from Justine about the future impact of AR, he continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JFbx8T"&gt;I mean, simple things today that you can use it for, like if you’re shopping for a sofa, or a chair, or a lamp, in terms of really experiencing it in your place, we’ve never been able to do that before until the last couple years or so. And that’s at the early innings of AR. It will only get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NExGsI"&gt;What’s Apple’s plan for AR?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MZhJMH"&gt;Clearly, Tim Cook has been bullish on AR for a long time. But so far, Apple’s biggest foray into AR remains the 2017 launch of ARKit — which use iPhones’ and iPads’ cameras and sensors to overlay images in 3D space when the device is pointed at a given area — for iOS 11. ARKit is available across Apple’s devices, which meant a lot of &lt;a href="https://github.com/olucurious/Awesome-ARKit"&gt;cool little projects&lt;/a&gt; by amateur AR enthusiasts. When ARKit launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the tech had the potential to allow Apple to catch rival Google in the AR space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv9YB6"&gt;But despite the interesting early projects, ARKit hype fizzled after a few months. It’s not totally clear why, because it was released at the height of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; craze when AR finally had a popular mass-market application for a devoted fan base. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;itself is still wildly profitable&lt;/a&gt;, raking in a billion dollars a year on average, but we haven’t seen a larger movement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikGTfK"&gt;Since ARKit, Apple has made other, smaller steps forward with AR apps for the iPhone. In May 2019, it introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/14/statue-of-liberty-ar-ios-app/"&gt;Statue of Liberty AR app&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1128412203932049408"&gt;Cook tweeting&lt;/a&gt;, “The Statue of Liberty app is just the beginning of how AR will transform the way we connect with our world’s treasures.” In July 2019, it introduced augmented reality art sessions for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh9exC"&gt;In addition to Tim Cook’s constant cheerleading of the technology, there are other signs that Apple is moving toward an AR future. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natbro/status/1155849145350909954"&gt;hiring of people like Nat Brown&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Microsoft; listing &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/01/apple-lists-ar-vr-jobs-reportedly-taps-executive-who-finalizes-products/"&gt;dozens of AR and VR job postings&lt;/a&gt;; acquisitions including &lt;a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/28/apple-buys-german-augmented-reality-firm-metaio/"&gt;Metaio in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15877520/apple-sensomotoric-instruments-acquisition-ar-vr-eye-tracking"&gt;SensoMotoric in 2017&lt;/a&gt;; and patents on things like “&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=09383582&amp;amp;SectionNum=1&amp;amp;IDKey=4E2221DF6AD9&amp;amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=9,383,582.PN.%2526OS=PN/9,383,582%2526RS=PN/9,383,582"&gt;head mounted display&lt;/a&gt;” devices all demonstrate its steady progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WuEKr7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s AR hardware is perennially two years away&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbknTJ"&gt;Reports started &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-augmented-reality-vr-virtual-reality-headset-powered-by-a-wireless-wigig-hub/"&gt;trickling out in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had a timeline to launch both an AR headset and AR glasses. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses"&gt;The company had 1,000 engineers&lt;/a&gt; working on its VR and AR initiative — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-04/apple-augmented-reality-headset-executive-leaves-company"&gt;codenamed “T288”&lt;/a&gt; — which were expected to include a combined VR and AR headset to be released in 2021 or 2022, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, with a pair of sleeker AR glasses predicted to launch in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqsIdJ"&gt;The latest reporting from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-ar-vr-headset-will-need-connection-to-other-device-such-as-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;however, indicates that an Apple AR / VR headset may need to rely on the processor of another connected device like an iPhone (similar to the early Apple Watch models), and that Apple is working on a custom chip for the helmet-like headset that might take at least another year to arrive. Some aren’t as bullish on the glasses-like variant either; &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; suggests Apple could still release that in 2023, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks&lt;/a&gt; a 2025 release is more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2d0mj"&gt;It shouldn’t be all that surprising that Apple has taken its time making AR hardware. It is, after all, the company that introduced the AirPower wireless charging pad, showed it off to the world, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;canceled the product because it wasn’t up to company standards&lt;/a&gt; — and that was just an charging accessory, not a potentially new computing paradigm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrJyTD"&gt;So it’s to be expected that Apple would take its time on an AR or VR headset. After hyping the potential for AR all this time, Cook surely doesn’t want Apple to repeat the failure of Google Glass by launching iGlasses too soon, and definitely not before the technology meets Apple’s very high bar.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wipeout gets ‘reimagined’ as a mobile game where you manage instead of drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Wipeout Rush" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wAYiRItfE5je3fDHFY-ogAwGD4w=/0x0:1942x1295/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866650/wipeoutrush.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="or3y46"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, the fast-paced, futuristic racing series that’s synonymous with PlayStation, is coming to iOS and Android mobile devices later in 2021. The new game is called &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt;, and unfortunately, it might not be what you’re after if you’ve adored previous entries in the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI50dq"&gt;The game, developed by Rogue, is a card-based racing game that doesn’t actually put you in the driver's seat. Instead, you’ll be the team manager of racers who will get to do all of the fun driving while you’re dealing with cards. The game promises to dive into the lore of &lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m most looking forward to finding out why the player can’t drive. Did they lose their license?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pymiAg"&gt;Here’s a description of &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://rogueco.com/portfolio-item/wipeout-rush/"&gt;as noted on Rogue’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4Q0mTJ"&gt;For fans of the series, &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt; is bringing loads of new lore through collectables and story. Players will be able to unlock collectable cards to learn more about the ships, teams, pilots, and tracks of the Wipeout world as they progress through an engaging single-player campaign told through exciting animated comics. &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt; will include both Quick Race and Championship Cup game modes complete with 5 different tracks, 60 iconic Wipeout ships, a wide range of familiar weapons, 12 Championship Cups each with their own boss, and bundles of collectables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BX0rfV"&gt;For a second there, I imagined how great a &lt;em&gt;Wipeout &lt;/em&gt;game for phones could look and play, especially now that there are several phones with fast refresh rate displays (the iPhone 13 Pro is the most notable addition to that group recently), as well as solid mobile controllers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RonRWE"&gt;I’m willing to give this game a shot when it comes out, and it could be fun in its own way, but it’s been a while since I’ve so quickly gone from being excited about something to just being a little sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHi11c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXLIvJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBksi0"&gt;Gaming laptops are by no means cheap, but today you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086M8PQYR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $800 on the Razer Blade 15 Advanced at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This laptop was built expressly for the purpose of delivering desktop gaming performance in a laptop form factor. Packing an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q graphics card and a 10875H Intel processor capable of topping out at 5.0GHz, the Razer Blade 15 does exactly that. The FHD display has a 300Hz refresh rate, better than you’d see on most desktop gaming monitors, allowing for sharp reaction times and virtually no lag, letting you get the drop on your enemy. A 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of RAM round out the laptop’s specs, offering you plenty of onboard storage and speed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Razer Blade 15 Advanced review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="y47mjC"&gt;Ahead of the new 2021 base iPad releasing next Friday, September 24th, you can save $30 on a preorder through Walmart. Normally $329 for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;the 64GB Wi-Fi model that Apple just introduced&lt;/a&gt; at its “California Streaming” event, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1133983/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F483978365&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A6890999&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=6890999" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $299&lt;/a&gt;. So, get it for this price while you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwoqO3"&gt;This model features a slate of improvements over the previous generation, including the bump up to 64GB of storage, the faster A13 Bionic processor, and True Tone screen tech that lets the screen match the color temperature in your room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cbGCeh"&gt;If you’re a streamer in the market for a new microphone, look no further than the Razer Seiren Emote, now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XB39R7B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This slick hyper-cardioid condenser microphone bears a striking resemblance to the other entries in the Seiren family, until it connects with Razer’s streamer companion app. The front of the mic contains an 8-bit LED display, capable of showing hundreds of customizable emotes that react to your chat. While this mic certainly isn’t for everyone, you’ll have a hard time finding a microphone more unique or better suited to connecting with your audience during a stream. Amazon notes that only a few units are left in stock, so hopefully it replenishes throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w0ml3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gj9UpW"&gt;Anyone looking for a midsize 4K TV should definitely check out this deal at Best Buy. This 50-inch model from Sony is still &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAEDde5Aev#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Best Buy for $700&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date. In addition to offering crisp 4K resolution, the X80J touts several features that elevate the viewing experience. HDR10 and Dolby Vision certification provide deeper blacks and more vivid colors, while built-in voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant allow you to easily search and swap channels. The TV includes built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, too, which help cut down on cord clutter, and the X80J can be wall-mounted with any 200 x 200 VESA mount. The TV can also handle up to four HDMI devices and offers an audio return channel in case you want to route your devices through a soundbar or receiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nHPwZ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754734"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gReWX9"&gt;One of the lightest wireless mice in Razer’s arsenal is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Hyperspeed-Lightest-Wireless/dp/B07YPC3BQC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for just $120 today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from its normal retail price of $150. The Viper has been a mainstay of the Razer armory for some time, but this wireless version brings some solid improvements to the tested design. The Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed weighs a paltry 74 grams and packs a powerful 20K DPI optical sensor. The ambidextrous design also sports six remappable buttons, making it one of the best mice available for southpaw shooters. The most noticeable improvement, however, is the inclusion of wireless connectivity. It can be paired either via Bluetooth or to the included 2.4GHz dongle, and the Viper Ultimate is said to last up to 70 hours on a single charge and can be recharged either via Micro USB or with the included recharging dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="udUahX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754700"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V7YzIa"&gt;A pair of earbuds that no Apple aficionado should be without, the Beats Powerbeats Pro, are &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1151608/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fpowerbeats-pro-wireless-earphones%2F-%2FA-78362035" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Target for $175 in red&lt;/a&gt;. These water-resistant earbuds can handle even the sweatiest workouts, and the adjustable ear hooks ensure they won’t jostle loose during a run. The earbuds can last for up to nine hours on a single charge but can stretch to 24 hours if the case is topped off. While the earbuds definitely work best with Apple devices thanks to their built-in H1 chip — a piece of hardware allows for always-on Siri detection and better call quality in windy environments, among other improvements — they can be used with a wide variety of Bluetooth-enabled devices. Just note that the charging case can only connect using an Apple lightning cable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WGWd5F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9EzqOl"&gt;A solid addition to any Xbox or PC gaming setup, the HyperX CloudX Flight Wireless is currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAVP3dG6gn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fkingston-hyperx-cloudx-flight-wireless-gaming-headset%2F93G680VL1NKH%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; for $120, its second-best price to date. HyperX is known for its comfortable and functional gaming headsets. It may lack some of the outward flair of its competitors, but the CloudX can still trade blows with competing headsets that are nearly double the price. The CloudX Flight comes with a detachable boom mic, leatherette ear cups, and boasts a battery life of up to 30 hours. While the CloudX has been designed for the Xbox family of consoles, it can still connect to PCs thanks to its 2.4GHz wireless dongle. It even comes with a built-in chat mixer, so you can adjust your audio levels without combing through in-game menus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make iPhone 13 preorders a one-step process on Friday by following these steps  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_vNfkWDiabkczCTpDc4TicD6fM=/277x0:1456x786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866078/image__4_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process lets you make your selection ahead of preorders opening.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Apple.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bQuvga"&gt;If you’re planning on preordering one of Apple’s new iPhone 13 models at 8AM ET on Friday, September 17th, you might be interested to know that &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-offers-more-ways-to-shop-for-the-iphone-13-lineup-ipad-and-ipad-mini/"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; customers can pre-register their details to make the checkout process a little easier. Now, before you say anything, I completely agree that the idea of &lt;em&gt;pre-registering &lt;/em&gt;for a &lt;em&gt;preorder&lt;/em&gt; sounds ridiculous. But if you’re someone who wants to complete the preorder as quickly as possible to guarantee an early ship date during a time of global component shortages, it’s a useful trick to know. Just be aware that this process is only available until midnight on Thursday, Eastern Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xuY6R"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/iphone-upgrade-program-iphone-12/?Bibblio_source=true"&gt;isn’t the first time Apple has offered pre-registration&lt;/a&gt;. But previously this route appears to have been reserved for customers on the iPhone Upgrade Program, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-pre-orders-get-ready/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, a 24-month payment plan that includes AppleCare Plus and offers a phone upgrade each year. But now anyone can enter their details early to buy a phone with far less hassle on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU0o9c"&gt;To pre-register, head over to the Apple Store app or &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone"&gt;Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt; to get started. Anyone on the upgrade plan will have their upgrade eligibility checked and credit lines approved. Other customers can pick out their preferred iPhone model, register their carrier status, enter payment details, and pick out accessories and / or an AppleCare Plus plan. Just be aware that some users are reporting seeing a “Your iPhone pre-order has expired” error message, which &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/expired-phone-13-pre-order-message-glitch/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Xkgk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 16th, 9:35AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added link to Apple’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-offers-more-ways-to-shop-for-the-iphone-13-lineup-ipad-and-ipad-mini/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;press release&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple rumors were wrong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKHVS98oRvLVujwbE22WM_qpH0E=/243x0:2637x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864614/Screen_Shot_2021_09_15_at_1.34.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: Tim Cook, knowing he’s not about to announce the thing I want.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4822ua"&gt;For many who follow tech news closely, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; had a few big surprises — not because there were completely unexpected announcements, but because we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;didn’t see things we really thought we’d be getting&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors that had enough smoke to be almost a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21508779/apple-iphone-12-october-event-what-to-expect-hi-speed-rumors"&gt;sure-fire thing in previous years&lt;/a&gt; ended up falling flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpQrSZ"&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knom6u"&gt;The Apple Watch was rumored to get a complete redesign, featuring flat edges and a flat screen. We saw this design in renders, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/"&gt;reportedly leaked CAD files&lt;/a&gt; (which act as a 3D blueprint for products), and even heard that it’d be happening from noted Apple reporter Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-12/what-s-new-about-apple-aapl-iphone-13-and-apple-watch-series-7?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;two days before the event&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;the Apple Watch that showed up on stage&lt;/a&gt; does have some design tweaks, it looks nothing like what we were expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N1vUzoxNV7Zba4LIgjYD0Afx0nc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850146/Capto_Capture_2021_09_14_01_24_25_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series 7 has a refined version of the same design we’ve had for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scaNm7"&gt;Another notable analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, also &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/12/kuo-airpods-3-to-be-announced-at-september-event-airpods-2-to-remain-in-the-lineup/"&gt;reported days before the event&lt;/a&gt; that Apple would debut a new set of AirPods, redesigned to include shorter stems. The wireless earbud redesign has also been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-26/apple-developing-smaller-airpods-pro-revamped-entry-level-model?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;rumored for months&lt;/a&gt; by Gurman, we’ve even &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/"&gt;seen alleged pictures of them&lt;/a&gt;, and some noted publications wrote that Apple was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;set to start production on the buds in August&lt;/a&gt;. With this rumor, though, it’s possible that just the timing was off, and that Apple will release them at an (of course!) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1437140403803672581"&gt;already-rumored future event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mddFlo"&gt;Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/18/iphone-13-always-on-display/"&gt;also suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 13 could feature an always-on display, thanks to the (accurately rumored) LTPO display that could theoretically allow for the low refresh rate needed to make always-on not destroy the phone’s battery. The always-on rumor was also &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/14/iphone-13-always-on-display-matte-back/"&gt;backed up by well-known leaker&lt;/a&gt; Max Weinbach earlier this year. Alas, Apple didn’t announce this display feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672551/iphone-13-display-lock-screen-always-on-variable-refresh-android"&gt;has been a staple on Android phones&lt;/a&gt; for years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OlWDU1hldO__KA_AdXUW7bHsRj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850539/iW5zNz7dVo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro has a display that could enable always-on, but the feature is absent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IEO7Ea"&gt;There was also just some general weirdness with rumors this time around. Only a few weeks before the iPhone 13 was announced, Kuo wrote that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647252/the-iphone-13-5g-leo-satellite"&gt;it might have the ability to communicate with satellites&lt;/a&gt;, letting you make calls or texts without cell service. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22649340/apple-iphone-13-satellite-connectivity-emergency"&gt;The next day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; offered its own interpretation, saying that Apple was working on a satellite communications feature for emergency use, and that the iPhone 13 may include hardware for it, but probably not software. However, when the iPhone 13 spec page hit Apple’s website, it &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/that-whole-iphone-satellite-thing-was-bogus"&gt;didn’t include any mention&lt;/a&gt; of the cellular bands that started the starry-eyed rumors in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e9w6RR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rumors have always needed a grain of salt, but this year seemed to have some big misses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SHA3DM"&gt;Of course, rumors have always had to be taken with a grain of salt, as anyone trading in them is almost certainly going to be working with incomplete information. Still, some of the big names like Kuo and Gurman get it right so often — the rumors about the iPad Mini redesign, high refresh-rate iPhone display, and smaller notch all came true, and we even saw the rumored cinematic camera mode. Success like that, and how accurate rumors have been in years past, can make it easier to forget the tenuousness of rumors — no matter how many times &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1429768663658377218"&gt;people like Marques Brownlee remind us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Na5eAM"&gt;This isn’t to laugh at those who believed the rumors, or say that there’s no place for rumors in the buildup to events — it can be exciting to feel like we’re getting a peek at what’s coming next, and to start thinking about whether we’ll pick up the new device, and how we’ll use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUvsSK"&gt;P.S. Remember this moment if Apple announces something that looks suspiciously like a Mac event later this fall. This isn’t to say that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;14- and 16-inch redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; with all the ports and processing power you ever wanted &lt;em&gt;aren’t &lt;/em&gt;coming, but treating them as a sure thing could lead to some real heartache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7YkH6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 event was a case study in Tim Cook-era product refinement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nY-wgBmscZppIFjXnbt-lR0xykI=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864483/caZMw9TLgc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L12bxo"&gt;For the past ten years, Tim Cook’s greatest accomplishment as Apple CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;has been vastly more of the same&lt;/a&gt;. More iPhones, more iPhone accessories, more apps, and &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; more money. While the Mac and iPad have occasionally fallen into disrepair, the company keeps coming back with new reasons to buy its greatest hits every year — and this year’s iPhone 13 event is a near-perfect case study in how far refinement can take you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfHWL7"&gt;As my colleague Jon Porter points out, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675797/iphone-13-12s-upgrade-cycle-iterative-improvements"&gt;the iPhone 13 is effectively the iPhone 12S&lt;/a&gt;, an iterative, incremental update to last year’s phones instead of something that feels brand new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dXLvBc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tim Cook’s Apple, ten years later","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fZSCix"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost everything got better&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9rX6ak"&gt;But oh, what an update. What company wouldn’t dream of being able to say they improved the processing power AND the battery life AND the cameras AND the displays AND the storage capacity AND the connectivity AND the design in the course of a single year, all without changing the price one bit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wS1uT"&gt;In 2021, the same $829 you’d pay last year now buys you &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; the storage, a whopping 2.5 additional hours of quoted battery life, more 5G bands, and an additional 175 nits of brightness over the iPhone 12, plus the 47 percent larger sensor and sensor-shift stabilization system that was previously exclusively available in the $1,099-and-up iPhone 12 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673545/iphone-13-pro-camera-cinematic-mode-video-features-macro"&gt;A new cinematic video mode&lt;/a&gt; isn’t exclusive to the Pros, either (though smooth 120Hz screens, a new macro photography mode and ProRes video will be.) And while the company doesn’t offer any real numbers to back it up, Apple claims even the iPhone 13 Mini will give you the fastest processor available in any smartphone on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WRtdZf"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPhone 13 event in 15 minutes|103694" data-volume-uuid="15e5aff54" data-volume-id="103694" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-24" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mg0Hef"&gt;Also, you can’t say the design didn’t change at all. While&lt;em&gt; the notch &lt;/em&gt;still exists, it’s smaller! (I like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;the iPhone 13 Pro’s blue&lt;/a&gt; an awful lot, too.) The only tradeoff I can find this year — ahead of our reviews, that is — is that the iPhone 13 lineup is oh-so-slightly thicker and heavier. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;You can find our comparison charts here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kd0ptM"&gt;This year’s iteration is so compelling that I’m vaguely tempted to upgrade my perfectly good iPhone 12 Mini to get that better camera with sensor-shift and an additional hour or so of battery life. (I probably won’t, since the announcement means the resale value of my existing phone has likely already tanked, but I do worry Apple might still cut off the Mini next year due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;reportedly lackluster sales&lt;/a&gt;.) If I had an iPhone 11 or earlier, it’d be a no brainer — I’d definitely be preordering one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bJplwW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says it every year, but the iPhone 13 cameras do seem much improved","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675127/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-camera-analysis-specs"},{"title":"Goodbye and good riddance to Apple’s 64GB iPhones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22675300/apple-64gb-iphone-13-128gb-standard-storage-space-photos-videos-apps"},{"title":"The iPhone 13 is a pitch-perfect iPhone 12S","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675797/iphone-13-12s-upgrade-cycle-iterative-improvements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BqqQKq"&gt;And while it might feel criminal that the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;$329 10.2-inch iPad&lt;/a&gt; still uses a Lightning connector and first-gen Apple Pencil, Apple’s still issuing a decent upgrade there without asking for more money — doubling the base storage from 32GB to 64GB, moving from the A10 Fusion chip to A13 Bionic, and hopefully finally putting a decent front-facing camera (12MP, vs. just 1.2MP!) onto its entry-level tablet computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kR-Dwve4mGztbuaSeoftPRaRGec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853917/uJGfKlMU0L.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u12G4J"&gt;The story’s a little bit different with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;the 6th-gen iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, mind, since it starts $100 higher than before at $499. But the upgrade incentives are still strong: it’s a crystal-clear update over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;its predecessor&lt;/a&gt; with a larger and higher resolution 8.3-inch screen despite its slightly smaller and lighter frame, with a magnetic connector to dock a 2nd-gen Apple Pencil. It’s got the A15 Bionic chip from the new iPhone 13, but with the extra graphics core you’ll only otherwise fined on the iPhone 13 Pro. The camera’s bigger and faster at 12MP and f/1.8 (compared to 8MP and f/2.4), with 4K video for the first time, and both the Wi-Fi 6 and 5G support that the 2019 model lacked. Just don’t go looking for a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMqdPy"&gt;Apple is managing all of this during a pandemic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;a global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, and so far there’s only been a single indication that Tim Cook’s giant manufacturing machine can’t keep up: The new Apple Watch Series 7 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;rumored to be delayed due to production issues&lt;/a&gt;, and while it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666305/apple-series-7-manufacturing-issues-resolved-september-mass-production"&gt;reportedly overcame them&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t have any release date for the new watch save “later this fall” and Apple’s being cagey about the details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2wfR6eU2cufFTX1Lpx7Ey-y5uA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853915/BCslcISSRg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XWhnSI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1nc9br15gf0scjb/Apple%20Watch%E2%80%94Then%20and%20Now%20%28Sept%202020%29_L568943A-en_US.pdf?dl=0"&gt;A leaked spec sheet for the watch&lt;/a&gt; suggests it was supposed to ship in September alongside the new phones, but the fine print says even its specs are “subject to change without notice,” and Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment about the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlMIUA"&gt;The watch is why I say this year’s event is a &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; perfect case study: it’s not as clear why someone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"&gt;would buy the Series 7 over a discounted Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, despite the larger and reportedly more durable screen. With the same battery life and no reason to believe there’s more processing power or functionality, plus a late start, it might be the one insufficient iteration this year.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>

      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPads are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable — now outgoing — entry-level iPad from last year, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of sale happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s often what deal our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each iPads model that is currently available, some of which are also available &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished&lt;/a&gt;. You should also be aware that &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop%2Fback-to-school&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is currently running its back-to-school promotion&lt;/a&gt; until September 27th, meaning you can snag a free set of AirPods with the purchase of either an iPad Air or iPad Pro. If you prefer the AirPods Pro, you can also upgrade for an additional $90. Either way, you have to be a student who’s eligible to check out through Apple’s educational storefront. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;2020 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s most affordable tablet, however, it’s now being replaced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;9th Gen model announced&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;Apple’s recent iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re in the market for the new model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"&gt;preorders are available now&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments slated for Friday, September 24th. As you might expect, there are no discounts currently available on the 2021 model, given the tablet has yet to hit store shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;If you want to try getting the best possible price on last year’s model, though, know that the 32GB model initially retailed for $329 and the 128GB variant for $429. The new, 64GB model goes for the same price as last year’s 32GB variant ($329), while the 256GB configuration jumps to $479. The 2020 model has the same 10.2-inch display and features the older A12 Bionic processor, a front-facing Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the physical home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9iBwQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431710"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, the outgoing base model iPad is a bit hard to come by at many retailers. It is either out of stock or marked as discontinued at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5J9699?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-10-2-inch-wi-fi-only-8th-generation%2F-%2FA-81498539%3Fpreselect%3D80596591%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1751882593844829755#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594504-REG%2Fapple_myl92ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_32gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, Apple only offers a refurbished one with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFW782LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-IPAD-WI-FI-128GB-Silver%3Ffnode%3Df7a6c58dde7329b21579b02c65a17e1f89102b3746bf56fb4fc1e60dbff56530c0f1da3d19e86a9a6f6e6858f96394b5d01117d34b59a73cdea074885f80ed0867aa9a4cdbdcf73ca96c7f42bd02edf1&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage and Wi-Fi for $279&lt;/a&gt;, though the new ninth-generation model might be a more compelling proposition if you prefer the benefits of the faster A13 Bionic processor and 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. That said, we’ll keep an eye out for any sale opportunities before the 2020 iPads are completely gone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019 with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. Just like the base iPad, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new iPad Mini was announced&lt;/a&gt; during Apple’s “California Streaming” event. While the upcoming, revamped Mini looks promising with its larger screen, top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and 5G option, it also starts at a higher price point of $599. The current iPad Mini has the A12 Bionic processor and normally runs $399 for 64GB of storage and $549 for 256GB. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $529 for the 64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model of the 2019 iPad Mini don’t always come around, though we have seen some recently. The 64GB, Wi-Fi-enabled iPad Mini is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available right now for $299 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in space gray and gold. Amazon does not currently have any 64GB models in stock, but is offering the 256GB unit &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $449&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-256GB%2F211304805%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart offers all three colors of the expanded storage option for the same price&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skoMEh"&gt;Just like the base iPad, the replacement model looks enticing — and if you’re interested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can preorder it now&lt;/a&gt; — though there will certainly be a bigger price delta with the increased starting price of the new iPad Mini and the fact that its predecessor is sure to continue receiving discounts. Also, as of right now, the 2021 model is not available at a discount, which is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $500 — $100 off the list price — in all of its vibrant colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB, Wi-Fi-enabled version is available for a $100 discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, with your choice of most colors marked down to $650. The one outlier is the green model, which has a more modestly discounted price of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Green%2F705887437%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$720&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tNTIrn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple is releasing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 on September 20th","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in some configurations at Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB base storage is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1148110/2092?subId1=VergeiPadDeals080321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-silver%2F-%2FA-77616876" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $700 at Target&lt;/a&gt; — though you may have to pick it up at a brick-and-mortar location near you. The 256GB model is available for $769 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553812-REG%2Fapple_mxdc2ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $800 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; in space gray. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $950 and $1,150, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo. If you prefer Wi-Fi only, the 128GB model is discounted to $849 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553840-REG%2Fapple_my2h2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.

Lastly, the 512GB model is $1,150 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; while the massive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; is $1,350&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-generation model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

That shaves $100 off the cost of either of those massive storage options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;The desirable Mini LED-equipped 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $999, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date.
