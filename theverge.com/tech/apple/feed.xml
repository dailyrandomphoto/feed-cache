    <title>How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 features larger screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAQ6pp"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; Series 7 was announced alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s the final device of Apple’s new fall products to launch. This newer model sits atop Apple’s current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios if you want to pay for service with your carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMTfvS"&gt;After Apple’s initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;the new models are set to release on October 15th&lt;/a&gt;, and you can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder them now through Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKhcuwgnDQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640209%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fapple-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_6549129&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LuD92a"&gt;What’s new&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="roSEq8"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 prominently features that new, larger display that stretches the screen closer to the edges for a more full-bleed aesthetic and showing more actionable information at once. It has a slight curve at its farthest edges, though Apple says the watch is overall more durable thanks to a 50 percent thicker glass cover and IP6X rating for better dirt and sand resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RLkrZ"&gt;New watch faces exclusive to the Series 7 promise to put that extra screen real estate to work, while the watch maintains a physical footprint that is close to its predecessor. Apple has also improved charging speeds, including a new USB-C wireless magnetic fast charger with the watch that it claims will offer up to a 33 percent quicker charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lttaJ7"&gt;On the software side, the Apple Watch Series 7 runs watchOS 8, supports a full swiping keyboard for text input, is compatible with new workouts, and maintains all the health-tracking features found on prior iterations: sleep tracking, heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and fall detection that now registers during workouts. There is plenty to take advantage of if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch and prefer to have Apple’s latest and greatest iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s break down all that there is to offer here before we dive further into specific configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ixNYqI"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yBbMqA"&gt;You can preorder your preferred configuration directly from Apple or a variety of retailers right now, with the earliest orders shipping on October 15th. The main options for you to decide on, aside from your preferred color, are size and connectivity. The base Apple Watch Series 7 configuration is a 41mm, GPS-only model that retails for $399. The 41mm version with a cellular connection runs $100 more at $499. If you have a larger wrist or prefer bigger screens, the 45mm GPS-only model is $429, while its cellular-equipped counterpart climbs up to $529. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CYcjeM"&gt;Preorder all sizes, colors, and configurations at Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ybj2aF"&gt;If you want an Apple Watch with your pick of the litter for bands — standard, premium, or fixed-length — then Apple has the most on offer. It’s the only place you can order an Apple Watch with custom-sized solo loop straps, though be sure to use the size guide. Shipments are initially expected for October 15th, however, select models won’t ship until early to mid-November. If you opt for in-store pickup at an Apple Store, it might still be the 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iin96H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1oQQDo"&gt;Preorder at Best Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UewUYo"&gt;Best Buy’s site is indicating that the base 41mm GPS model will arrive on release day, while some other configurations with cellular connectivity are to be expected around October 25th. The retailer has all colors available for the size and connectivity of your choice, each with a matching sport band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6zF2jz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="r0rafV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qmXurY"&gt;Preorder at Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5PezQJ"&gt;Walmart has a variety of anticipated shipping dates for preorders. All preorders are expected to ship by October 15th, though, some individual configurations have delivery dates ranging from the 15th to the 21st. Oddly, the red, 45mm LTE model notes a shipping date of October 11th, though we would advise not putting too much confidence in its accuracy. There can sometimes be errors in retailer listings as soon as a product is put up for sale, which is often corrected later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h4THAO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797290"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="5A8W7H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h2Dlds"&gt;Preorder at Target&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eWiJze"&gt;Target lists each and every color and configuration of the aluminum Apple Watch Series 7 as shipping by the release date of October 15th. This can always change on the fly, but it is worth considering if you want to get your new watch as quickly as possible. Target RedCard members will also receive free shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NR6Vib"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kSl7XQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797315"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uoprLg"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 from phone carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3dbtKG"&gt;Most major phone carriers in the US offer the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 for preorder, which can help if you prefer to purchase the smartwatch on a monthly installment plan that you might already have for your phone. For the cellular models, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11557999?sid=VergeAppleWatchSeries7100821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13761603?sid=VergeAppleWatchSeries7100821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fapple-watch-series-7-41mm-green-aluminum-clover-sport.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7-41mm%3Fsku%3D194252566381&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; all offer the Series 7 in each of its sizes and colors at the same starting price as Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxgiN"&gt;Apple has confirmed that when you &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Faluminum-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 through its own store&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-14498937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint / T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, you will get $100 back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g50QyqEKJq0rPdmM51JUYxdmD-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900357/Apple_watch_series7_availability_hermes_10052021.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VH7yJz"&gt;More premium case options and custom configurator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T46tsH"&gt;Apple has also offered the latest top-end watch in additional case materials for years. This generation is no different, with the Series 7 available in &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Fstainless-steel-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stainless steel starting at $699&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Ftitanium-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;titanium starting at $799&lt;/a&gt;, as well as band options from luxury fashion boutique Hermès. The easiest way to preorder these is directly from Apple, as it carries the most options and not all retailers sell the more luxurious watches — though &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKhlKGfOGa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; does have some stainless steel models available for preorder. Most people opt for aluminum, which offers the same functionality at a lower price, but the premium models have a unique fit and finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR4t55"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fstudio%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s own online boutique for creating exact custom Apple Watch configurations, makes a return for the Series 7. If you prefer an Apple Watch in a particular combination of size, finish, color, and band, you can make your selection and pay the configured price directly from Apple. This is the only way to order one of the popular solo loop straps with your Apple Watch, as those fixed-length straps are only sold through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This iPhone 13 case adds what the phone was always missing — a candy launcher</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZvQwDjQwcpWnaum9SmBD2GhMXhc=/213x0:2130x1278/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970698/Screen_Shot_2021_10_08_at_10.34.53_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vOXkPc"&gt;No matter how much Apple hypes Ceramic Shield — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509008/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-mini-displays-ceramic-hardened"&gt;the special glass mixture introduced with the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; — and the build quality of the metal and glass sandwich that is the modern iPhone, expensive phones need cases. Maybe you ordered one alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;your new iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, but if you didn’t, may I propose an exciting and undeniably useful option — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX46nzE9wmw"&gt;a giant case that rockets hard candy&lt;/a&gt; into your mouth (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-perfect-iphone-13-case-holds-a-bunch-of-candy-and-s-1847825950"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTtUK1"&gt;YouTube creator and inventor Matty Benedetto is responsible for the DIY case, which he calls the Candy Catapult. It’s 3D printed from flexible TPU filament with a hard candy container back for your poison of choice, be it M&amp;amp;Ms, Skittles, or Reese Pieces (only sickos would mix all three). To actually launch the candy out of the case, Benedetto added a pinball machine-esque spring-loaded plunger. It’s hard to gauge just how hard it launches its little sugary missiles, but it definitely seems strong enough to send a piece of candy clear across the room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDDmDGco2eD9u6gy6eIIBJQCbAI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910798/gif__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Candy Catapult works!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g924kt"&gt;My first thought watching Benedetto’s video is not relief that I suddenly have a way to dispense with my industrial-sized bag of lozenges (no help needed there) but really excitement over the other possible things one could launch from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kyZmu"&gt;I’m really just wondering how quickly this becomes a weapon with metal ball bearings in it. Is it launching it hard enough to break a window if you were to swap candy with something more... damaging? Some things are perhaps best left unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removes the Apple Watch Series 6 from its official lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYWFlMkuzt0_wwbCBJd7o5Dp_Ag=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970023/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtqCI4"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 is finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available to preorder&lt;/a&gt;, nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple announced the new smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. But the launch of the Series 7 also brings the removal of the Series 6 from the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fwatch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F8%2F22716438%2Fapple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official Apple Watch lineup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHP2Nv"&gt;If you want to buy a brand new Apple Watch from Apple, you now only have three options: the Series 7, which starts at $399; the still-very-good SE, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; and starts at $279; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;years-old Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFwQ27"&gt;There are still a few ways to get a Series 6, though, and given how many features are shared &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-6-vs-apple-watch-series-7/"&gt;between the Series 7 and the Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, the previous generation model could be a good option to consider if you want to save some money.

    <title>Apple’s 2020 iPad Air is down to its lowest price yet today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FMfAHQh2K8WDQuNngHf5Tjy41L0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69968651/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lp7Lmo"&gt;Apple’s fourth-generation iPad Air with a refreshed design and USB-C charging instead of Lightning &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is down to its best price yet at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can get the 64GB Wi-Fi model in the color of your choosing for $489 — $10 less than the starting price &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;for the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; that has a similar design. For the price, you’re getting a far bigger tablet. If you’ve been in the market for a high-end iPad but don’t want to put down iPad Pro-levels of cash, this could be exactly what you’re after. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0lw7Hg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YtW7Pt"&gt;For the first time since launching earlier this year, the navy-colored Apple AirTag Loop is &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/0Jjn2V"&gt;selling for $19 instead of its typical $29&lt;/a&gt; at Adorama. The simple, polyurethane loop allows you to add your AirTag — which lacks a lanyard hole — to accessories like your backpack, keychain, and luggage. Although there are often more affordable third-party loops available, this is a rare deal Apple fans may find worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tj5Kpn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795285"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3r70zX"&gt;If you’re in the market for a competent laptop, Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091WY8D1C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $849&lt;/a&gt;, a $250 discount. Equipped with 512GB of storage and Intel’s 11th Gen Core i5 processor, the 15.6-inch laptop normally goes for $1,100. In addition to offering an AMOLED display and 20 hours of battery life, the lightweight Windows machine also comes with Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, a Thunderbolt 4 port, and Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics. Those deeply embedded in the Samsung ecosystem might also enjoy how you can easily pair the clamshell laptop with Samsung’s line of Galaxy Buds and quickly share files across Galaxy devices with Quick Share. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our hands-on impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GhiBux"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QP1QmY"&gt;Apple owners planning on traveling this upcoming holiday season may be interested in this rare discount on the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2FVerge%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fvergedailydeals092321%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-qi%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple MagSafe Duo Charger&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $129, Verizon is currently selling the charger — which you can fold to make smaller and thus more portable — for $97, one of its lowest prices to date. With the wireless charging station, you can charge MagSafe-compatible iPhone 12 and 13 models, as well as the Apple Watch, select AirPods models, and various Qi-certified devices. Note, however, that in order to fast-charge your iPhone, you’ll need at least a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20W power brick&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow for charging speeds of up to 11W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7S41gC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="frrWKi"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgopro-hero9-black-waterproof-action-camera-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero9&lt;/a&gt;, the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;biggest, baddest action camera out there&lt;/a&gt;,” is $70 cheaper today at Woot. Now until October 30th (or while supplies last), members can &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgopro-hero9-black-waterproof-action-camera-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pick up the popular action camera for $380&lt;/a&gt; instead of $450, with free shipping for Prime members. The GoPro Hero9 can capture 5K video at 60fps as well as 23MP stills, and it features a new processor and a removable lens. Just like the newer Hero10, it offers crisp footage along with a great front-facing screen and rugged build quality. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review"&gt;Hero10 review&lt;/a&gt;, the last-gen model is not too dissimilar from the more expensive Hero10 — that is, unless you need smooth, 5.3K 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fV9noY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10332746"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejat2B"&gt;Apple fans, we’ve got another deal you might love. If you’re open to a desktop computer, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5P7TLW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can save $100&lt;/a&gt; on the 512GB version of the 2020 Mac Mini, which comes with Apple’s new M1 chip. Regularly $899, the Mac Mini is on sale at Amazon for $799, its lowest price to date. After testing the Mac Mini, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; the device’s performance to be impressive and praised how well existing apps run on the M1 chip. We did, however, dislike the built-in speaker and the fact that the Mini only offers up to 16GB of unified memory. Note the 256GB configuration is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 cheaper today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, selling for $659.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l2cY7u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfid-3136639543"&gt;Apple products aren’t the only thing on sale today. In case you weren’t already aware, we’re coming up on our anniversary. That’s right, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is officially turning 10, and we’re throwing a party on October 22nd and 23rd in New York City in honor of the occasion. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702324/on-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators"&gt;On The Verge&lt;/a&gt; will feature exhibits, live performances, guests like the CEO and co-founder of Clubhouse, and so much more. Right now, you can purchase tickets for less than half the price, and grab them for $99 instead of $254. Each ticket comes with four complimentary drink tickets as well as entry for both days. To take advantage of the deal, you just need to register&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/evite"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and enter promo code &lt;strong&gt;$99NOW&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. Hope to see you there! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SVP of Android offers open invitation to help Apple put RCS texting on the iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The Samsung Electronics Co. Unpacked Product Launch Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eQL9Bb5kUymvqQoti8MsQwG4MQ=/0x3:3000x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967396/1200178032.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HlGXtY"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953"&gt;tweet earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, Google SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer called on Apple to support RCS, the next-generation texting standard that’s supposed to supplant SMS. He offered an “open invitation to the folks who can make this right” and said “we are here to help.” Translation: the “folks” are Apple and “we are here to help” is Google’s offer to assist Apple in implementing the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eefiaP"&gt;RCS is finally starting to gain traction around the world. Its biggest champion has been Google, which finally landed on using it as the default texting solution for Android phones after trying every other solution. RCS is far from perfect, but it’s clearly superior to SMS (which is, of course, a low bar). After securing deals from US carriers to commit to the standard in the next year, Google is setting its sights on a new target for evangelism: Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k633wL"&gt;Apple has yet to reply with comment to any inquiry from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over several years on whether it intends to support RCS on the iPhone, and declined to comment on this story. It seems unlikely that RCS is coming to iOS anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EXREhk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Group chats don't need to break this way. There exists a Really Clear Solution. Here's an open invitation to the folks who can make this right: we are here to help.    &lt;a href="https://t.co/4P6xfsQyT0"&gt;https://t.co/4P6xfsQyT0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60ao87"&gt;Lockheimer’s tweet followed a cheeky chain of tweets that started with a &lt;a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/bryson-dechambeau-iphone-ryder-cup-grouptext?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=golfdigest"&gt;story about how pro golfer Bryson DeChambeau was breaking iMessage group chats with his green bubbles&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Android/status/1446182495846912006"&gt;official Android account cringingly&lt;/a&gt; drawing a parallel between green bubbles and the &lt;a href="https://www.golfmonthly.com/tour/us-masters/masters-history-records/masters-green-jacket-126753"&gt;famous Masters green jacket&lt;/a&gt;. Lockheimer jokes that there is a “Really Clear Solution” (RCS) to group chats not breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKQVLi"&gt;RCS has had a long, convoluted (and unfinished) slog towards becoming the default texting experience on Android. Beginning in March 2021, Google began securing deals from US carriers to get them to commit to using Google’s Android Messages app as the default on all Android phones sold on their networks. It started with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;blockbuster deal with T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, followed later by smaller deals with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;. Once all those deals are implemented, Android users who text each other will switch over to RCS, which supports typing indicators, better group chats, and bigger multimedia messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SV52C7"&gt;Importantly, RCS on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;Android Messages also supports end-to-end encryption for one-on-one chats&lt;/a&gt;. That will mean Android users texting each other will have a higher level of privacy and security than when they text iPhone users — and vice versa. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713543/syniverse-hack-five-years-text-messages"&gt;recent hack on SMS company Syniverse&lt;/a&gt; is just the latest example of why encryption is important in messaging — especially for the default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwXfhp"&gt;RCS has problems of its own, though. As with iMessage, it’s possible for messages to get lost in limbo when switching phones. It’s also a standard that is championed by Google but theoretically agreed upon by carriers around the world. The association with Google has tainted RCS in the eyes of many, and of course requiring carriers to agree on anything is a recipe for problems. There are also technical limitations, as &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/7/"&gt;Ron Amadeo explains here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvu6A5"&gt;Nevertheless, it seems inevitable that RCS will replace SMS eventually — but only if Apple decides to support it. As more carriers adopt it and as more users realize that SMS is inherently less secure, Apple could begin to feel enough pressure to adopt RCS. Thus far, however, it hasn’t shown any signs of that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ireland’s status as tax haven for tech firms like Google, Facebook, and Apple is ending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life In Dublin During COVID-19 Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ecAb1FhBrpAVFNXojRpTl2b_Zbo=/0x37:5890x3964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966603/1233382967.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google in Dublin | Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSVGtj"&gt;Ireland said Thursday it &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/59812-ireland-joins-oecd-international-tax-agreement/"&gt;would join an international agreement&lt;/a&gt; that sets taxes on profits for multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15 percent. This is a major shift for the country that is the European headquarters for many large US pharmaceutical companies, as well as tech firms, including Google, Apple, and Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QIsgP"&gt;An increase from Ireland’s current 12.5 percent to 15 percent may not seem that large by itself. The so-called Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework agreement, outlined in July, is actually a two-pillar plan aimed at helping end tax avoidance and making international tax rules fairer and more transparent. The OECD has &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/about/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that a 15 percent tax rate would generate some $150 billion in global tax revenue annually and would help to stabilize the international tax system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE36Ic"&gt;Ireland signed on to the deal ahead of a Friday meeting at the OECD among the 140 countries that have been negotiating its terms for several years. The plan calls for global companies to pay taxes in countries where their products or services are sold, even if they don’t have a physical presence there, and would apply to multinational companies with revenues above €750 million (about $867 million). For companies with revenues below €750 million, the 12.5 percent rate would remain in effect in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVeFW8"&gt;Over the past several decades, Ireland has served as a tax shelter for many large tech companies, thanks to its low corporate tax rate. Companies typically create Irish subsidiaries of their companies that license their intellectual property, on which the subsidiary pays royalties. Some 800 US companies have operations in Ireland, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.amcham.ie/"&gt;American Chamber of Commerce Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, employing about 180,000 people. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apples-cork-campus-celebrates-40-years-of-community-and-looks-to-the-future/"&gt;Apple opened its first plant in Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 and now employs some 6,000 people on its campus in the city of Cork. Facebook established its &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2008/10/facebook-to-establish-international-headquarters-in-dublin-ireland/"&gt;international headquarters in Dublin in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/13/business/technology-briefing-e-commerce-google-chooses-dublin-for-headquarters.html"&gt;Google announced its European headquarters&lt;/a&gt; would be in Ireland in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y34ICX"&gt;Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/speech/615f7-statement-by-minister-donohoe-on-decision-for-ireland-join-oecd-international-tax-agreement/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that the agreement will “address the tax challenges of digitalisation.” Donohoe added that he believes companies will still choose to locate their headquarters in Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34KCdt"&gt;“I am confident that Ireland will remain competitive into the future, and we will remain an attractive location and ‘best in class’ when multi-nationals look to investment locations,” Donohoe said. “These multinational enterprises support our economy with high value jobs, and at the same time, Ireland provides a stable platform and a long proven track record of success for MNEs choosing to invest here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKurZd"&gt;If the OECD agreement moves forward, its provisions are expected to take effect in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pUeTI8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; has been renewed for a second season on Apple TV Plus, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F10%2Fapple-tv-renews-global-hit-drama-series-foundation-for-a-second-season%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22715363%2Ffoundation-renewed-second-season-apple-tv-plus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple announced today&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of the release of the fourth episode of the first season on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="okqv8M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s Foundation starts out big, lavish, and a little boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="caQlc3"&gt;The renewal is a vote of confidence from Apple, as one of the flagship shows on Apple TV Plus, meant to help bring in viewers as a prestige genre show in the same way that &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; does for HBO, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; does for Disney Plus, or &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; for Netflix. That said, outside of today’s press release (where Apple calls the show “a global hit” that “quickly proved to resonate with audiences”), the company hasn’t even provided vague estimates of how popular the show has been so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xecQq"&gt;“With season two, our audience will get to visit more of Asimov’s indelible characters and worlds, including Hober Mallow, General Bel Riose, and all the Outer Suns,” showrunner and executive producer David S. Goyer said in Apple’s press release, indicating that the second season will at least in part cover the latter half of Asimov’s &lt;em&gt;Foundation,&lt;/em&gt; as well as its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Foundation and Empire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPOE56"&gt;Goyer has big ambitions for the series, too; in an interview &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/david-s-goyer-interview-1234983774/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he mentioned that his original pitch to Apple was eight seasons long. And while Apple hasn’t publicly commented on how much the lavish series costs, Goyer mentioned that “if you were to take two episodes and put them together, the budget is bigger than some of the movies I’ve done.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2k4Mq"&gt;Apple’s announcement doesn’t say which (if any) of its season one cast members will be returning for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s second season. But given the anthology nature of Asimov’s novels — which are a collection of short stories that span centuries of time — it’s likely that a second season would bring new faces to the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONCmVY"&gt;Whether Apple is willing to pony up for the full 80 episodes that Goyer envisions to properly tell his story is still an unanswered question, but with a second season on the way, it seems that &lt;em&gt;Foundation &lt;/em&gt;fans will at least get to see the entirety of Asimov’s first book adapted in live-action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7vBlJ"&gt;The remainder of&lt;em&gt; Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s first season airs weekly on Fridays on Apple TV Plus; no release date for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s second season has been announced. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 has often recieved the biggest discounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;preorder one of the recently announced Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen more than its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tA5jd3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"},{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Right now, there aren’t deals available on the 38mm Series 3, which is only available for its standard price of $199 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJYnqufKYm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1161528/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-38mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101052%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtmnv%26DFA%3D71700000087521670%26CPNG%3DPLA_DVM%252B0064R00001AFOp3QAH-Apple_GoogleSearch_AO_Q4_FY21_AO%26adgroup%3DPLA_Apple%2BAirTag%26LID%3D700000001393753pgs%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9004339%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwtfqKBhBoEiwAZuesiJUi6dcVJIyvV2yp8_t07QEQXzMl8yEsT1GQ2bYjHatSoPfkIJXtHxoC6DAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. For that price, you might as well spring for the larger, 42mm configuration; both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LDCEnn"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version in white at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/1143052/9383?sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue%26%3D%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_zLjVYQ2UGxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkBXlQ2B1yfEVg0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DzLjVYQ2UGxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkBXlQ2B1yfEVg0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $275 — a minor $4 discount — or for full price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJYfu2GpGW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for the larger 44mm model with GPS, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38733&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-44mm%2Fprod25100056" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt; are offering it at a slight discount of $299, though, the latter is only exclusive to Sam’s Club members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="23GjQy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="rUGNYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. That said, the red and blue models are both seeing a steep discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, with both retailing for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm Series 6 is your fancy, it’s available in red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $379, slightly more than its best-ever price and evidence of the major discounts the red versions can sometimes see. Other colorways, including the pink (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1149510/9383?sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F683927568&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A9987250&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=9987250" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5SQ3MG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) and white models (&lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F351352991%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5V1YWL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;), are available for $415 at the same retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phil Lord and Chris Miller’s next project is a murder mystery for Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLhzBaN9EzPTC-Qn98sr5yr3GCU=/67x0:1795x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965572/Screen_Shot_2021_10_07_at_11.45.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0xCARw"&gt;Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the producers behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the writer-directors of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/10/5396322/the-lego-movie-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are bringing their talents to Apple TV Plus. &lt;em&gt;The Afterparty&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/10/apple-tv-reveals-first-look-teaser-of-highly-anticipated-murder-mystery-comedy-series-the-afterparty-ahead-of-january-2022-debut-on-apple-tv/"&gt;a new eight-part murder-mystery comedy series&lt;/a&gt; created and directed by Miller, with both Lord and Miller serving as showrunners and executive producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OIwlr"&gt;The new series “centers on a murder mystery at a high school reunion,” Apple says, with each episode featuring “a retelling of the same night told through a different character’s perspective, each with its own unique visual style and film genre to match the teller’s personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IBgSf"&gt;The show stars Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, Ben Schwartz, and Ilana Glazer, among several other comedy stars (and apparently Dave Franco). It’s hard to get a real sense of the details of the plot based off this first trailer (Haddish is investigating the murder?), but the premise and cast are certainly promising. Plus, stories with equally vague premises — &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; starts as &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/game-night-review.html"&gt;a movie about people playing board games&lt;/a&gt; before it gets wacky — have historically allowed for plenty of shocking twists and humorous setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlutM4"&gt;Lord and Miller have another streaming project in the works as well. In February 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276330/hbo-max-clone-high-animated-series-season-2"&gt;HBO Max announced&lt;/a&gt; it was reviving Lord, Miller, and Bill Lawrence’s animated show &lt;em&gt;Clone High&lt;/em&gt; for the streaming service. Apple already has a successful working relationship with Lawrence, who’s a co-creator of its &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/09/emmys-2021-winners-full-list.html"&gt;Emmy-winning comedy &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25MU7v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afterparty &lt;/em&gt;will premiere globally on Apple TV Plus in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdlTDs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671574/epic-apple-app-store-new-rules-meaning-ruling-decision"&gt;The ambiguous finish to the Epic v. Apple trial&lt;/a&gt; opened a tiny crack in Apple’s control over in-app payments on the iPhone — and now, a small developer is trying to crawl through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbM0H1"&gt;A company called Paddle &lt;a href="https://paddle.com/platform/in-app-purchase/"&gt;has announced its own in-app payment system&lt;/a&gt; that will take a smaller cut than Apple’s system — 5 to 10 percent, instead of the 15 to 30 percent cut claimed by Apple. It’s a way around the commission fees that started the fight with Epic in the first place and likely to be the beginning of a new fight for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90WU9S"&gt;Paddle’s system is designed to take advantage of the Epic v. Apple verdict, which required Apple to allow external payment links. Prior to the verdict, an App Store rule had banned “external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms” — but the judge found that rule violated anti-steering laws. Paddle’s system offers just such an external link, kicking users off to an outside page where they can pay before returning to the app. It definitely adds friction to the process, but it’s a far cry from the workarounds you’d have to go through if you wanted to skirt Apple’s IAP system today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwLH1X"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment as to whether apps using the system would be allowed on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Paddle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demo of what a Paddle “in-app purchase” would look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rgTiqz"&gt;One of Paddle’s biggest selling points is its fees — Apple famously takes a 30 percent cut (or a 15 percent cut &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150629/apple-small-business-program-app-store-reduced-commission-15-percent-developers"&gt;if you make less than $1 million on the App Store in a year&lt;/a&gt;) on in-app purchases for most developers. Paddle is offering a 10 percent cut on payments less than $10 and a 5 percent plus $0.50 charge on payments above $10. It’s not hard to see how switching from Apple’s payment system would be attractive for some developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdgWap"&gt;The real test will be seeing how apps that include Paddle’s payments fare during App Review. If Apple wants to find violations of its rules in apps using Paddle, it very likely will. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;company has said&lt;/a&gt; that it’s trying to figure out how it can change its rules to comply with the judge’s order, but so far, the new rules haven’t been made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCjjfm"&gt;Paddle told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an emailed statement that the company was waiting to see how the details of the ruling were implemented and that it’s built a few versions of its system to make it easier to adapt to whatever Apple’s rules end up being. It plans on launching its in-app payment service on December 7th, and the company’s CEO said that it “would welcome Apple’s view on this to bring more clarity.” Apple didn’t immediately respond to request for comment on Paddle’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPJs3q"&gt;You may also want to keep in mind the privacy implications of developers being able to communicate with users, as mentioned in the order — Paddle says that, unlike Apple, it’ll let developers see customers’ email addresses to help with billing support. While that comes with benefits (like developers &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/24/apple-in-app-refund-notification-changes/"&gt;actually getting to be involved in the refund process&lt;/a&gt;), you may want to keep in mind that you could be sharing your email address when you’re kicked over to a Paddle payment screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BzwNGG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will competition bring out the best in Apple, or will it prove the company right?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gmhwIy"&gt;Paddle also lists other benefits of its IAP platform, such as developers being able to price their app how they want without worrying if Apple will approve, the ability to set pricing on a country-by-country basis, and the ability to provide coupons. And, of course, the smaller cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYIXv0"&gt;With this being the first big challenge to Apple’s own IAP system since the ruling, it’s likely to attract a lot of attention (Epic CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1446117510919585796?s=20"&gt;is already tweeting about it&lt;/a&gt;). Part of what makes the proposition so exciting is that, until this point, the arguments for either side have been mostly theoretical. If a competing in-app purchase system really does start making it to apps, and it takes off, we’ll get to see whether the competition will make Apple’s service better, as some developers have argued, or if it will lead to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;even worse proliferation of scams&lt;/a&gt;, where developers charge $100 a year for a weather app, as Apple has implied. &lt;/p&gt;
