    <title>Warby Parker can renew glasses and contact lens prescriptions with its updated app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RqFCqZpvxisTNYZtREXMPphrj4Q=/168x0:1419x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600721/Screen_Shot_2021_07_16_at_10.44.40_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warby Parker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="86i0B9"&gt;Warby Parker is updating its Prescription Check iOS app on Monday with a new name and the ability to renew glasses &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; contact lens prescriptions on the iPhone 6S and up (the company currently doesn’t offer an Android app). Like its predecessor, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.warbyparker.com%2Fvirtual-vision-test&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F19%2F22580166%2Fwarby-parker-contact-lens-glasses-prescription-renewal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the new Warby Parker Virtual Vision Test&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a substitute for an actual optometrist visit, but being able to snag a new prescription for $15 without having to schedule an appointment should be very handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNCCxj"&gt;With Virtual Vision Test downloaded, you’ll be taken through some intake questions, not unlike what you might fill out in a normal optometrist visit (“Do you regularly get headaches?” etc.). Warby Parker requires you to meet some basic criteria as well, like being 18 years of age or older, not having any “eye health concerns,” using a single-vision distance prescription, and seeing well with your current glasses or contacts. With those taken care of, the app guides you through a simple vision test, reading off letters that appear on your phone’s screen, and alternating covering your eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLH3yy"&gt;Warby Parker says it takes about 48 hours for a new prescription to be written, but it won’t charge you $15 unless you’re approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nOyCPd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZC_xVikK5Zw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JyJeui"&gt;Prescription Check used a laptop and a phone to measure out your eyes’ distance from the test and to enter in prompts, but Virtual Vision Test makes things a bit easier. Warby Parker says the updated app uses a new “proprietary distance estimation algorithm” and a software framework exclusive to Apple devices called &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision"&gt;Vision Framework&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep everything contained on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQP5xU"&gt;Vision Framework covers a wide swath of possible use cases in iOS, from scanning bar codes to enabling the head tracking used in AR filters, but Warby Parker says that combined with its algorithm it makes the process of taking a vision test less complicated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1Ei92t"&gt;Because the tool is able to measure distance and tell a user when they’re at the correct distance to take the vision test, the possibility of human error while measuring is reduced. Overall, this results in an even simpler and more efficient user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="spx6Z6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A proprietary distance estimation algorithm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I8n54E"&gt;That’s helpful because this is the first time the company’s also offering the ability to renew a contact lens prescription online. Warby Parker’s Scout line of contact lenses &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-19/warby-parker-launches-scout-daily-contact-lenses-at-440-a-year"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but never made it to the older Prescription Check app until now. Warby Parker hasn’t said if any of the technical changes it’s made to its app make it easier to account for a contact prescription, but they do require different measurements and considerations than traditional glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qr1YuG"&gt;Ultimately, all of this high-tech convenience is to push you to buy new glasses frames or contacts directly from Warby Parker, and the company’s leveraged Apple tech to make that as fun and interactive as possible. If you have a iPhone X or newer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18205654/warby-parker-ar-iphone-face-id-mapping-glasses-try-on-app"&gt;you can virtually try on the company’s frames&lt;/a&gt; right from its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4UymL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmqgrJ"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest leaks indicate new iPhones may have always-on displays like Apple’s Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mf_L1zV7IAzv_m4dcuHJ_uI_jM0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69598039/jbareham_170916_2000_0057.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R1XMX5"&gt;A new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman says the 2021 iPhone may have an always-on display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20869098/apple-watch-series-5-always-on-screen-features-price-best-smartwatch"&gt;similar to Apple’s Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and which Android phones have had for some time. Gurman wrote in his &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on"&gt;Power On newsletter&lt;/a&gt; that the phones will have improved battery life, a smaller notch on the screen, better video recording, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a faster A15 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7WmVs"&gt;It isn’t the first time a leak has suggested Apple is working on always-on screens for upcoming iPhones. Leaker Max Weinbach hinted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqOujNnuHBg&amp;amp;ab_channel=EverythingAppleProEAP"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that Apple may use the same kind of low temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels that its Watches have on future iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYvGYi"&gt;That’s in keeping with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s previous reporting that “at least one” of the four new iPhones will include an LTPO display. The technology dynamically adjusts Watches’ screen refresh rates to conserve battery life. Analyst &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt; also said earlier this year that the Pro iPhones coming this year would have LTPO displays and 120Hz refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIFGFl"&gt;In addition to the possibility of always-on iPhone screens, Gurman reported that Apple will likely announce new MacBook Pros this fall, “between September and November at the latest.” The computers will begin production in the third quarter, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jK75jI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 rumors grow more certain ahead of September launch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>How to use Focus modes for notifications on iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LpwHJOG0qh5NeRuIONYyBV-oDcs=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69597234/focus2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lilxvH"&gt;One of the most powerful new features in iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, is Focus mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYYfJM"&gt;At its core, a Focus mode is a more customizable version of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb and is accessed from the same menu on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. But Focus modes are far more customizable, allowing for more granular triggers for when you’re filtering out notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Pn8SJy"&gt;To set up a Focus, head over to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Focus” and hit the plus button to add a new Focus. You’ll also be able to see existing Focus modes that you’ve set up and edit them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="byicVU"&gt;Apple offers a variety of preset Focus modes to start with, including Personal, Work, Fitness, Gaming, Reading, and more.  You’re not limited to Apple’s preset suggestions, though some of the presets — like the Driving, Fitness, or Gaming ones — offer additional features and triggers that aren’t available to user-created ones. Apple’s Fitness Focus mode, for example, can be automatically triggered when you start a Fitness Plus workout on your Apple Watch, while the Gaming mode can turn on whenever you connect a Bluetooth controller. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XSdC6b"&gt;You can create a custom Focus by selecting Custom, which will let you select a name, icon, and color for that specific focus. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0rJ922zkJK1HYgkTYRVlTUEmOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722624/IMG_2971.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting allowed contacts on a Focus mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BWlkT3UZMVR9mthWICQ3aFHl_fU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722625/IMG_2972.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selecting which apps can send notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RbG2hC"&gt;Next, you’ll be asked to choose which of your contacts (if any) you’d like to be able to message you when that Focus mode is activated — similar to how Do Not Disturb works. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ObuqH7"&gt;The following screen will ask you to select which apps (if any) you want to allow to send notifications when that Focus is active. For example, if you’re making a “Work” Focus, you might only want your email and Slack apps to be able to send you pings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zRv3Ws"&gt;Lastly, Apple will ask if you’d like to be able to receive special “Time Sensitive Notifications” — a new category of extra-important notifications that apps will be able to send that might not be able to wait until later. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68bOT1HEw2UNEI4aqXAgv3iyaiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722626/IMG_2973.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The toggle to permit time-sensitive notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hclipC1UmvcD8JJV2ma-rf14H2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722627/IMG_2967.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main Focus setting menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V6MgwY"&gt;Once you’ve finished setting up your Focus, you’ll end up on the Focus mode’s setting menu, where there are a few additional things you’ll be able to configure. You can also get back here at any time by heading to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Focus,” then selecting the Focus mode you want to edit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="51dh4u"&gt;The Focus Status menu will let you decide whether contacts will see a notice if you’re in an active Focus mode and their messages are muted. (Although right now, the only app that supports the feature is Apple’s Messages.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nui0Ov"&gt;The Home Screen menu allows you to hide specific home screens on your iPad or iPhone when you’re in a Focus mode. Combined with iOS 15’s App Library and the new ability to create multiple copies of an app icon, you can use this feature to customize what your phone looks like in different situations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R131dW"&gt;The Lock Screen menu offers the option to show or hide silenced notifications on the lock screen or to dim the lock screen when the Focus mode is active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RtJkCFe6sjUa3VlDU2CZcQ0E1Bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722631/Apple_iPadPro_iPadOS15_springboard_focus_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus modes on iPadOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="83ZphP"&gt;Finally, there’s the actual activation of a Focus mode. Apple offers two ways to turn on a Focus mode: you can either manually select it from the moon icon in Control Center or schedule it automatically (settings for which can be found in the Focus menu).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akxno0"&gt;The simplest option is “Smart Activation,” which has your device automatically toggle a Focus on its own. But you can also add more granular manual controls, activating a Focus for specific times, when you’re at a specific location, or when you’re using specific apps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon just got Fakespot booted off Apple’s iOS App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQcC_ha6Fx5vGHwYUEVWTyuCXug=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69593254/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0005.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="erAuS3"&gt;Fakespot, known for its web browser extensions that try to weed out fake product reviews, suddenly no longer has an iPhone or iPad app — because Amazon sent Apple a takedown request, both Amazon and Fakespot confirm, and Apple decided to remove the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C03rj2"&gt;The giant retailer says it was concerned about how a new update to the Fakespot app was “wrapping” its website without permission, and how that could be theoretically exploited to steal Amazon customer data. Fakespot founder Saoud Khalifah told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple abruptly removed the app today without any explanation. Apple confirms it removed the app, but disputes the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUUrCW"&gt;The new Fakespot app launched &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/03/2241643/0/en/Fakespot-Rolls-Out-the-Fakespot-Secure-Shopping-App-The-Best-Way-to-Shop-Amazon-on-Mobile-Devices.html"&gt;just over a month ago&lt;/a&gt;, and I can confirm it let you log in to Amazon, browse, and buy items with Fakespot’s overlay on top. I downloaded and tried it a few weeks ago to see if it could help spot fake reviews on some new purchases, but I didn’t come to a conclusion on whether it actually helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WVCgFi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you to all of our users for making this new iOS app a reality. Together we will put an end to eCommerce fraud. We have more amazing products coming soon that will make secure shopping the gold standard for eCommerce.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/UyUnsOydzK"&gt;https://t.co/UyUnsOydzK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fakespot (@FakespotTweets) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FakespotTweets/status/1407028418970107904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OocBqg"&gt;But in mid-June, says Fakespot’s founder, Amazon initiated a takedown notice. And just hours ago, says Khalifah, Apple finally delivered a blunt three-line email about how it regretted that the situation couldn’t be resolved amicably and that Fakespot has now been removed from the App Store. “We just dedicated months of resources and time and money into this app,” says Khalifah. “Apple hasn’t even given us the ability to solve this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S39GGY"&gt;Hours after we published this story, Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that’s not exactly true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZHS71"&gt;“This was a dispute over intellectual property rights initiated by Amazon on June 8 and within hours we ensured both parties were in contact with one another, explaining the issue and steps for the developer to take to keep their app on the store and giving them ample time to resolve the issue. On June 29, we again reached out to Fakespot weeks before removing their app from the App Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fawnoh"&gt;Over the phone, Khalifah clarified that Apple did mention on June 29th that it “may be forced to pull” Fakespot from the App Store, but insists Apple never provided any other guidance, and that it was largely just conversation between Amazon and Fakespot where each argued their side before Apple yanked the app. “I’m shocked Apple decided to side with Amazon without any proof,” says Khalifah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHyiLM"&gt;Amazon tells us it believes Fakespot violated Apple guideline 5.2.2, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5.2.2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.2.2 Third-Party Sites/Services:&lt;/strong&gt; If your app uses, accesses, monetizes access to, or displays content from a third-party service, ensure that you are specifically permitted to do so under the service’s terms of use. Authorization must be provided upon request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HjJdjn"&gt;Amazon also tells us that Fakespot injects code into its website, opening up an attack vector and putting customer data (including email, addresses, credit card info, and your browser history) at risk, though it says it doesn’t actually know if Fakespot is using this information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5y16tw"&gt;“The app in question provides customers with misleading information about our sellers and their products, harms our sellers’ businesses, and creates potential security risks. We appreciate Apple’s review of this app against its Appstore guidelines,” reads a statement from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dt4S80"&gt;But while Fakespot admits the app injects code to display its own scores, he categorically denies there’s any vulnerability and points out that apps which include a web browser view are common — including coupon apps that Amazon seems to “have no problem with wrapping around a webview browser.” Amazon did, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21059083/amazon-honey-browser-extension-security-risk-paypal-acquisition-competition"&gt;try to warn against browser coupon extension Honey&lt;/a&gt; by suggesting it was a security risk last January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hbchv"&gt;Regardless of why, it’s a blow to one of the major outspoken critics of Amazon’s review system, as Fakespot is regularly cited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423429/amazon-top-reviewers-uk-fraud"&gt;in reports about review fraud on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon even bought search ads against the “Fakespot” keyword in the App Store to reduce the app’s potential impact:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGBOFMyACbWIRhRXF1Rd0BqSYa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722632/fakespot_amazon.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LLUezm"&gt;“Amazon is willing to bully little companies like ours that showcase the cracks in their company,” Khalifah says, suggesting Amazon must have realized people were choosing their app over the Amazon app. He says Fakespot racked up 150,000 installs from the iOS App Store, without spending any money on marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOgAwM"&gt;Amazon says it regularly audits companies that try to call out fake reviews and claims that Fakespot’s ratings are mostly wrong: “We regularly review products where Fakespot rated a product’s reviews as untrustworthy and their findings were wrong more than 80% of the time. They simply do not have the information we have—such as reviewer, seller and product history—to accurately determine the authenticity of a review.” Amazon suggests that it does a much better job of finding fake reviews itself by analyzing 30 million of them each week, though that clearly hasn’t stopped the fake and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;incentivized review problems&lt;/a&gt; yet — something we’re still investigating at &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2X4ttr"&gt;Amazon wouldn’t say if it’s contacted Google about the Android version of the app, but that app hasn’t been updated since 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7YXLU"&gt;Fakespot’s founder says the company is weighing its legal options now because it believes mobile is the future of shopping. “We’re seeing percentages of 60/40 now hovering in mobile’s favor,” Khalifah tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bcq3yp"&gt;“We will explore all the options we have available,” says Khalifah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emh2i5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:09PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added mention of browser coupon extension Honey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBVnSf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Apple statement and Fakespot’s reply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change your iPhone’s text size for a specific app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eTnXvK4Xy-tlW_cO9ot1wSwK5Tw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69592681/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vtitae"&gt;Sometimes you want the text in your app to be smaller, so you can fit more content on a single screen. Sometimes you want it to be bigger, especially if you’ve been putting off buying those reading glasses. But until recently, if you had an iPhone, you had to pick a single text size as a standard for all your apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2h7Pgx"&gt;Not anymore. In iOS 15, you can adjust the text size separately for each of your apps. So you can, for example, keep the text small for your email, but make it a bit larger in Twitter — or vice versa. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OmarShahine/status/1416015722174636033?s=20"&gt;@OmarShahine&lt;/a&gt; for the info.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BTHoFE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;One of the best hidden new iOS 15 features is per app font sizes. I like to use the smallest dynamic size system wide but bump up Outlook by one side since I read so much email. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aL8TxOIXVA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aL8TxOIXVA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Omar Shahine   (@OmarShahine) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OmarShahine/status/1416015722174636033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CUdOGB"&gt;If you’ve got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524845/ios-15-how-to-install"&gt;the public beta of iOS 15 installed&lt;/a&gt;, here’s how you can adjust the text size for each app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3cDHH"&gt;First, you need to make sure the “Text Size” option is in your iOS Control Center:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Zb85Lz"&gt;Swipe from the upper-right corner to get to your Control Center. Check to see if “Text Size” is there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q0DBBc"&gt;If it isn’t, then quit Control Center and go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Control Center.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f3J3dO"&gt;Under the “More Controls” subhead, find “Text Size” and tap the plus sign on the left to add it to your included controls. This will add it to your Control Center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To add Text Size, go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Control Center." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pi_CZZK0lWy_Z0gRc8_4uYmFjTU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722289/IMG_ACABE3FA7DC3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Control Center,” then find “Text Size” and tap the green plus sign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Text Size will now be part of the included controls." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QKlHTFYFkBpR78OLt5s9WUBYIAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722291/IMG_AEE5CFDB6AF2_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Text Size” will now be part of the included controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5tfcoG"&gt;Once that’s done, it’s simple to tweak the text size for each app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oQxLaT"&gt;Open the app that you want to configure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DcG7Nb"&gt;Swipe from the upper-right corner to get to Control Center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you need to switch text size, swipe from the upper-right corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PBe0WUM-qNKs-DLx27LYg-xbSio=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722286/IMG_7CC84A574C5C_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you need to switch text size, swipe from the upper-right corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap the double-A Text Size icon." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucja2xtAn--TcUc-gFqinNjPH6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722287/IMG_3D147AFAD9D1_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap the double-A “Text Size” icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Hxmd6X"&gt;Tap the “Text Size” icon (the one with the small and large A’s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="o9wtKb"&gt;At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see a toggle on the left for that specific app (for example, the left side of the toggle will say “Twitter Only,” and the right side will say “All Apps.”) Move the toggle to the left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wAo1FX"&gt;Once that’s done, use the main control in the center of the screen to set the text size for that app, and then tap anywhere on the screen to get back to the Control Center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The toggle at the bottom lets you switch text size for a single app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ghQ69r96AUnAqDvBhOr6gJ1p7UA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722282/IMG_B31FFB1D7C1A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The toggle at the bottom lets you switch text size for a single app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you’ve changed the text size just for that app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vbCFaIN3K1x3rMcvfSlL0LzroLI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722285/IMG_D714DD00DBB5_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you’ve changed the text size just for that app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="4jwEe9"&gt;Swipe up to get rid of the Control Center and you’ll return to your app. You should see the difference in the text size immediately — but that difference will not be reflected in other apps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jWTBAd"&gt;And, of course, if you want to switch back to a standard text size, just go back to the Control Center, select “Text Size,” and move the bottom toggle to “All Apps.” But be aware that you’ll be resetting all your apps to that text size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEjOQy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use SharePlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDiblckRVLHgrtbBPSEcr9coKKI=/248x0:1652x936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591839/Screen_Shot_2021_07_16_at_11.24.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aFX6H0"&gt;The headline feature for Apple’s fall updates (including iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey) is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to watch and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with friends and family while video chatting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVhoWh"&gt;Right now, the number of SharePlay-compatible apps is a pretty small list: the Apple TV app for movies and TV shows, the Apple Music app for music, and Apple’s Podcasts app for podcasts. The company is promising some bigger third-party partners when iOS 15 launches this fall, including HBO Max, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, TikTok, and Twitch. Some big names seem to be skipping out for now, though: most notably, Netflix and YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxxapQ"&gt;For now, if you want to try it, here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wyP4fu"&gt;SharePlay with iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDvm7iXfkPCtVxPnWrw6IuXTGBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721826/Apple_iPhone12Pro_iOS15_TV_Expanse_originals_060721_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starting playback of a TV episode using SharePlay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yCS1B9wBu4EH2FXYdzECRDF6Xdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721827/Apple_iPhone12Pro_iOS15_TV_Expanse_Messages_060721_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay allows you to still use your phone while watching shows together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c2EF2u"&gt;To use SharePlay on an iPhone or iPad, first, make sure that everyone on the call is using iOS 15 and iPadOS 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ilfgIM"&gt;Next, start a FaceTime call — either one-on-one or a group call — with everyone you want to watch or listen with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ea1Yzs"&gt;Once you’ve done that, exit out of the FaceTime call (which will automatically move to a picture-in-picture window) and head over to a SharePlay-compatible app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n0Od7O"&gt;After that, playing something over SharePlay is as simple as it is when you’re just watching or listening alone: just select whatever content you want, and it’ll play for everyone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Widx5O"&gt;Controlling a SharePlay stream just requires that you play, pause, and skip around as you usually would. SharePlay automatically keeps everyone’s streams in sync so that if one person pauses to get a snack, the movie will pause for everyone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="6qSHbT"&gt;You have two options for ending a stream: either end it for everyone on the SharePlay call or end it just for you (letting everyone else continue to watch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vDOHUv"&gt;SharePlay with macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p50DLz"&gt;Using SharePlay on macOS Monterey works similarly to iOS and iPadOS: you’ll need to start a FaceTime call, launch a compatible app, and play some content that everyone on the call can access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HktWcy"&gt;When you’re in a SharePlay session, you’ll be able to access controls for the call through a menu bar icon (instead of the pop-over menu that appears on iOS and iPadOS).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zxtzPYaDijnkIvV6LByNzsFSr-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721810/Apple_macos_monterey_facetime_06072021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;macOS’s SharePlay menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ni0t4U"&gt;SharePlay with Apple TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2BmoYv"&gt;Using SharePlay with an Apple TV works a little differently than the other platforms, given that you can’t actually start (or participate) on a FaceTime call through an Apple TV itself. Rather, when you’re FaceTiming on a nearby iPhone, iPad, or Mac with SharePlay, the Apple TV will offer you the option to hand off the media portion of that call to the bigger screen through Control Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWqzlT"&gt;To access that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Gzk4BJ"&gt;Simply follow the above steps to start a SharePlay FaceTime call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="B3ceKN"&gt;Then press and hold the TV button on your Apple TV remote. From there, you’ll be able to select the new SharePlay icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzMSmjBnB5ZjwW2NfJYmIZIQ5c8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721815/Apple_iPhone12Pro_iOS15_FaceTime_expanse_groupfacetime_060721_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iOS interface when watching a show on an Apple TV while using SharePlay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WjF2c5"&gt;It’s important to note that only the music or movie that you’re watching will shift over to the Apple TV. Your FaceTime video will still be playing on the Mac, iPhone, or iPad that you started with. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Counterfeit wireless earbuds are being seized in record numbers at US border</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XOc9geu894FJNlcKQmF2IgkMZ6s=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591470/AirPods.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/CBPChicago/status/1407021736089079815/photo/1" target="_blank"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMwSLT"&gt;The number of counterfeit wireless earbuds seized by US border customs in 2021 has already surpassed last year’s total, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/airpods-are-a-huge-hit-with-consumers-and-counterfeiters"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a sign of how eager the makers of these knockoffs are to keep riding the sustained popularity of earbuds like Apple’s AirPods and those from Samsung, Jabra, Bose, Sony, and other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftpC8P"&gt;According to the report, “roughly 360,000 counterfeit wireless headphones” — valued at $62.2 million — were nabbed in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. That’s well above the 295,000 pairs that were confiscated during the whole of fiscal 2020. Just yesterday, US Customs and Border Protection &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/thousands-fake-apple-airpods-worth-13-million-seized-cincinnati-cbp"&gt;announced a major confiscation&lt;/a&gt; in Cincinnati. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eyvo0A"&gt;Around 80 percent of fakes entering the US come from China, and their manufacturers see a huge opportunity: &lt;a href="https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Strategy-Analytics-True-Wireless-Stereo-Headset-Sales-Surge-90-in-2020-as-Chinese-Vendors-Surge/default.aspx"&gt;Strategy Analytics&lt;/a&gt; forecasted worldwide sales of Bluetooth headsets to be more than 300 million in 2020, and the true wireless earbuds market surged by 90 percent. Apple still holds a commanding lead in market share, though a crowded field has cut into that dominance. Research firm Canalys estimates that Apple took in at least $16 billion from AirPods sales last year, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; report. The introduction of the AirPods Pro in 2019 gave scammers a chance to try and wring even more money out of unknowing buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJcpfVFw7_W-F1lW4xc5kJPbDgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721822/clones.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/331000-worth-fake-airpods-seized-cbp-officers-louisville" target="_blank"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A confiscated shipment of AirPods counterfeits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w5v7lp"&gt;OnePlus had to deal with an awkward controversy last September when US Customs and Border Protection &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435637/us-cbp-counterfeit-airpods-oneplus-buds-mixup"&gt;seized a shipment of the company’s earbuds&lt;/a&gt; and described them as counterfeit AirPods. There are design differences between the two, but the blatant AirPod clones are getting closer and closer to the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LcIAZ"&gt;Some counterfeit earbuds are suspected to have been created “with genuine molds stolen from factories that work with Apple.” Others can mimic the AirPods pairing process on an iPhone and display a proper Apple serial number. But even in these situations, there are still subtle tells (like a bogus firmware version) that reveal a product as a fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlzhRG"&gt;Highlighting the potential safety risks, Apple says it has a global effort in place to tackle the issue of knockoffs, and it’s working with law enforcement and e-commerce sites to prevent customers from being duped wherever possible. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9pekq"&gt;Whether you’d like to admit it or not, school is quickly approaching. And if you’re in need of a reliable laptop that won’t force you to completely deplete your savings, Chromebooks aren’t a bad way to go. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; deliver great value for the money, and many offer terrific performance for far less than you would pay for a more premium machine. Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is one such device, even if the high-end convertible is one of the more expensive Chromebooks on the market right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEUc0Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746320001237385626#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Currently discounted at Best Buy to $619&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 model packs in 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i5, which is more than enough processing power for most people. Moreover, it boasts a great keyboard and a brilliant 3:2 screen, along with two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and enough battery life for a full day in the classroom — virtual or otherwise. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CDZr8x"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now-discontinued HomePod,&lt;/a&gt; the HomePod Mini is somewhat easy to forget. Apple’s pint-sized answer to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Mini&lt;/a&gt; still produces good sound for its size, though, and Siri remains a viable alternative to Alexa and Google Assistant, despite lagging behind when it comes to features and functionality. The compact smart speaker also plays nice with HomeKit-compatible devices and Apple Music, rendering it a device really built for those who are already entrenched in the Apple ecosystem. Normally $100, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1598683-REG%2Fapple_aphomepmsg_homepod_mini_space_gray.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F16%2F22577815%2Facer-chromebook-spin-713-apple-homepod-mini-microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is offering a rare $10 discount&lt;/a&gt; on Home Pod Mini, bringing the price down to $90 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xpKyaN"&gt;With COVID-19 restrictions easing and in-person gatherings become more commonplace again, now might not be a bad time to pick up an extra controller for your Xbox One, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, or Windows 10 machine.

    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Apple as number two smartphone vendor for first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RoEJx-ejU8P8R7snEItUUlFIHFo=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589716/DSCF5698.jpg_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F52BFY"&gt;Xiaomi is now the second largest smartphone vendor based on worldwide shipments in the second quarter of 2021, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021?ctid=2143-0b9f92413ead631983febced55e12cd8"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from Canalys. The Chinese company captured 17 percent of global market share, according to the research firm, just behind Samsung’s 19 percent but ahead of Apple’s 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gn7Ak"&gt;BBK’s Oppo and Vivo rounded out the list of top five vendors at 10 percent apiece. All five companies grew their shipments year on year, but what’s notable is just how much Xiaomi has managed to increase its volume — it shipped 83 percent more phones than in Q2 2020, whereas Samsung grew shipments 15 percent and Apple by just one percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vxj4as"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've moved up one more spot! Just in from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Canalys?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Canalys&lt;/a&gt;, we are now the 2nd largest smartphone brand worldwide in terms of shipments. This amazing milestone couldn't have been achieved without our beloved Mi Fans! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoMiWithoutYou?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NoMiWithoutYou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RT with ✌️from your Xiaomi smartphone :) &lt;a href="https://t.co/kKfuTK8K7J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kKfuTK8K7J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1415731357368471553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXhzMt"&gt;“Xiaomi is growing its overseas business rapidly,” Canalys Research Manager Ben Stanton says, citing sales boosts in regions including Western Europe, Africa, and Latin America. “It is still largely skewed toward the mass market, however, and compared with Samsung and Apple, its average selling price is around 40% and 75% cheaper respectively. So a major priority for Xiaomi this year is to grow sales of its high-end devices, such as the Mi 11 Ultra.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMFbf"&gt;Canalys says global smartphone shipments grew by 12 percent last quarter. Much of the growth seen by smartphone makers is at the expense of Huawei, however, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;itself overtook Apple in 2019&lt;/a&gt; but has since been essentially shut out of the worldwide market due to US-imposed sanctions and trading bans. So far, Xiaomi appears to be the biggest beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees say the company is cracking down on remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kxNmtVq_JC4s00f9NPfwg0RmLZs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588204/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="74nfy4"&gt;Apple employees say it’s harder than ever to get remote work requests approved after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;rolled out a new hybrid model&lt;/a&gt; that will require people to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Some employees say they will quit if Apple doesn’t change its stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNMKlT"&gt;While Apple historically discouraged employees from working from home, there were one-off exceptions to the rule, and some teams were more lenient than others. Now, employees say that even those exceptions are being denied. In a company Slack channel where employees advocate for remote work, roughly 10 people said they were resigning due to the hybrid work policy or knew others who’d been forced to quit. The Slack channel currently has more than 6,000 members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hkEz0"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560586/apple-hybrid-work-internal-survey-tim-cook"&gt;survey on remote work&lt;/a&gt; conducted by employees in June, 36.7 percent of respondents said they were worried they’d have to leave Apple due to the lack of flexibility (1,735 people answered the question).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBg79W"&gt;The return-to-work plan has already been a flashpoint at Apple, where employees wrote a letter in June asking Apple CEO Tim Cook to reevaluate the hybrid model. Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;sent a video in response&lt;/a&gt; saying that in-person collaboration was “essential” and noting the company would not be backing away from its current approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M1xHzX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I will be out of a job in September”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HielYm"&gt;While Apple’s corporate employees certainly have more flexibility than the retail staff, some say it’s out of step with other big tech companies in Silicon Valley. Twitter and Facebook have already announced a permanent work-from-home policy, and Apple employees say they’ve been flooded with recruiting messages from other tech organizations eyeing a potential opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ld1Cht"&gt;One employee said they were currently on an Americans with Disabilities Act accommodation that allowed them to work from home, but were told that accommodation would be denied when the company went back to the office. “I will be out of a job in September,” they wrote in Slack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jt11t"&gt;Apple typically gives employees 30 days to find a new job within the company if their current team denies a medical accommodation. But one worker said in Slack that there weren’t any open remote positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRBKN7"&gt;Some employees say they were told only people with documented medical conditions would be approved for permanent remote work. But the form that Apple employees use to request such an accommodation asks them to release their medical records to the company, which made some people uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LoIqvo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Things I'd never sign: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4KUv2DVQTT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4KUv2DVQTT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1415798144726671360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oU6QlI"&gt;Now, employees are discussing how to get Apple’s attention. Some suggested writing another letter to reiterate their concerns, while others have discussed talking to lawyers about possible legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToWXQ8"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
