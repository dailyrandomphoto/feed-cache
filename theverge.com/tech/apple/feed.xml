    <title>New Touch ID Magic Keyboards work with all M1 Macs, not just the iMac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple’s Magic Keyboard in purple, with a Touch ID button in the top right corner." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZkZxtSCDTUFhTdFFRaP9NJbAzRQ=/0x16:1933x1305/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167929/132_2021_04_20_132_vlcscreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Magic Keyboard has a Touch ID sensor on the top right.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nFtMuY"&gt;The Touch ID sensor in Apple’s new Magic Keyboard, which debuted alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;updated iMac&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, works with any Mac fitted with Apple’s M1 processor, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1384588508820647940"&gt;Rene Ritchie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/magic-keyboard-touch-id-compatible-all-m1-macs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. The catch is that, for now at least, the keyboard is only sold with  the new M1-equipped iMac, which is available to preorder from April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yLBdK"&gt;Apple has been shipping MacBooks with built-in Touch ID for a while now, but this is the first time it’s been available in an accessory. The biometric security method can be used for logging into the device, as well as authorizing purchases and signing into some third-party apps. The new Touch ID keyboard is available with a compact layout, as well as a full size keyboard with a numpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0o7QaS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You can only buy them with the M1 Mac (for now?) but you can use them (with Touch ID!) on other M1 Macs, or just as BT keyboards (no Touch ID) on Intel Macs/other devices. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mOOp5mbmg2"&gt;https://t.co/mOOp5mbmg2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1384588508820647940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dk29bH"&gt;The bad news for owners of older Macs is that the Touch ID functionality in the new keyboard won’t work with any Intel-based machines. The keyboard itself will reportedly function, just not the biometric security. As &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fimac-features-all-new-design-in-vibrant-colors-m1-chip-and-45k-retina-display%2F%23gallery-26ed471606120fad275da1d426bc5785%3A%7E%3Atext%3DCustomers%2520can%2520choose%2520from%2520three%2520models%2CMouse%2520and%2520the%2520industry%252Dbest%2520Magic%2520Trackpad.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22397196%2Fmagic-keyboard-touch-id-m1-mac-macbook-intel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s press release&lt;/a&gt; explains, the new keyboard requires the Secure Enclave in the M1 processor to encrypt the transmitted fingerprint information end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8hitW"&gt;Although the Touch ID keyboard is currently only available with the new all-in-one, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes that Apple has previously opened up exclusive accessories for general sale. For example, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17168720/apple-space-gray-keyboard-mouse-trackpad-now-available-pricing"&gt;started selling&lt;/a&gt; the gray keyboard, mouse, and trackpad for anyone to buy in 2018, after previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15743110/apple-imac-pro-space-gray-magic-mouse-keyboard-colors-wwdc-2017"&gt;limiting them to the iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYC-sV9f26gLYdwC4ya5f937KLY=/821x0:2261x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159412/airtag_accessories_header_202104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afQCgp"&gt;The Apple AirTags &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;have finally been announced&lt;/a&gt;, and with them come a ton of accessories to make them easier to use (so much easier than if it had, say, a built-in way to attach it to things). While a small tracking puck could be carried in a bag, there are a variety of other things that you may want to put an AirTag on that require some sort of holder or the judicious use of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aibtVD"&gt;These are all the accessories we could find that are either listed for preorder on the maker’s site or have a page on Apple’s store. We don’t have official ship dates for most of them, but it’s probably a safe bet that the ones on the Apple Store will become available when the AirTags do, on April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zukTwfmRIxQklWUdl7oFS7ls-Ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457924/HNPX2.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belkin’s AirTag holder. Tie it to anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pAbwNc"&gt;Belkin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RWmQC6"&gt;Belkin currently has two offerings, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPR2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPX2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-strap%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a strap&lt;/a&gt;, which both sell for $12.95. Both products have a circular holder for the AirTag and come in white, black, blue, and pink. They’re currently listed as unavailable in Apple’s online store and as “coming soon” on Belkin’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACO1OVMfOG9bRTqGaMafFuiVKRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457922/7245bb43_16cd_47d2_9cb4_94bc7f177b9a.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I genuinely love this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lTlcNk"&gt;Nomad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="678fYv"&gt;Nomad also offers its take on &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergAirTag042121&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-leather-keychain" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a keychain&lt;/a&gt;, but (characteristically) its version is a leather pouch that encases the AirTag. The company also has &lt;a href="https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergAirTag042121&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-glasses-strap" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a glasses strap&lt;/a&gt;, which acts both as a strap to keep your glasses handy and as an AirTag holder in case you manage to misplace them. Both are listed for $39.95 but are marked down to $29.95 if you preorder, which you are able to do now on Nomad’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spigen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spigen’s rugged AirTag case. Maybe you could attach it to your rock climbing gear?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XGObNE"&gt;Cyrill / Spigen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IwxThP"&gt;Cyrill is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.cyrill.com/collections/airtag/products/black-airtag?variant=36909671776414"&gt;vegan leather keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; in two colors, black and “stone” (which is a light gray). It costs $19.99 and seems to be available now. Spigen, Cyrill’s parent company, is also offering its own AirTag cases: a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-valentinus%3Fvariant%3D32709738725423&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-rugged-armor%3Fvariant%3D32709737971759&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a ruggedized case&lt;/a&gt; with a hefty clip connector (and what appears to be a bottle opener, though it’s not listed as a feature). Both are $24.99 — the keychain is available to order today, and the rugged case is available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAOJkLEdPjYmgkJgBM3cysqxx9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457912/MX852.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the bag charm. I dare you to put it on a Gucci or Louis purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kuvoxz"&gt;Hermès&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5fM4hd"&gt;Apple has a history with Hermès; the French luxury company made some jaw-droppingly expensive Apple Watch bands. True to form, the Apple Store lists a leather &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX872AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX8A2AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-luggage-tag%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;luggage tag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX862AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-bag-charm%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bag charm&lt;/a&gt; made by Hermès — costing $349, $449, and $299 respectively. It is worth noting, though, that the accessories do include an AirTag with a custom “Hermès” engraving, so you can flex while you find. The key ring and bag charm come in orange, brown, and what looks like black but is listed as “bleu indigo.” The luggage tag is currently only shown in brown. Like Belkin’s offerings, they are currently unavailable through the Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="B4yP8n"&gt;Device-customization company dbrand &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/apple-airtag-skins"&gt;is offering pre-orders for its skins&lt;/a&gt; (which sounds very creepy, without context) that allow users to change the color of their AirTags. A pack that allows you to add a dot of color to the front and back of the tracker will cost $4.95, and comes with dbrand’s promise to “make your tiny frisbee look and feel like it’s worth the four full-sized frisbees that your $29 could have bought instead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxKfm0"&gt;The company is also creating a case, which adds the much-needed (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;or not, depending on who you ask&lt;/a&gt;) lanyard loop that Apple left off the AirTags. The case is available for pre-order, includes a lanyard loop, and costs $15 — there’s also a $19.95 pack &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/apple-airtag-cases"&gt;that also includes a skin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ENSzYI"&gt;Everybody else &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CeOHhl"&gt;Of course, with how long AirTags have been rumored, there were some manufacturers that wanted to get a head start with their accessories.

    <title>Congress is diving into the App Store fight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rw1jktUqu509TLPu7lluKOhSU4E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166179/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s App Store was in the hot seat of Wednesday’s hearing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CxLVIP"&gt;For years, tech companies like Facebook and Amazon have faced the brunt of antitrust criticism by Congress, and Apple has gotten far fewer questions. But that changed on Wednesday, when Congress finally sunk its teeth into Apple as part of a hearing titled “&lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/antitrust-applied-examining-competition-in-app-stores"&gt;Antitrust Applied: Examining Competition in App Stores&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUPicq"&gt;The hearing brought in representatives from companies like Spotify, Tile, and Match Group, a dating app company, to explain how Apple’s App Store fees and walled-garden business strategy harms their companies. All three companies gave harsh testimony, accusing the iPhone-maker of anti-competitive behavior over the burdensome fees it charges some app developers on its App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="azEotX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If Apple turned on us, it can turn on anyone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EJuIjq"&gt;The timing couldn’t be worse for Apple, coming just a day after the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;an iPhone-linked item tracker&lt;/a&gt; called the AirTag in direct competition with Tile. Speaking to Congress, Tile’s General Counsel Kirsten Daru said that once Apple decided to develop its own item-tracking devices and services in 2019, the two companies’ friendly relationship dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsTAHu"&gt;“If Apple turned on us, it can turn on anyone,” Daru told lawmakers. “And Apple has demonstrated that it won’t change unless someone makes them, making legislation so critical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2St8f"&gt;Apple’s shifting platform relationships were a theme in the hearing, with each company testifying to how quickly Cupertino’s collaborative outreach could turn competitive. Match’s Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine told lawmakers that app store fees amount to the company’s single largest expense, totaling around a fifth of the company’s total sales. Spotify’s Head of Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer Horacio Gutierrez said that Apple’s business model equated to “a classic bait and switch,” luring developers into its app store and suddenly changing the terms to benefit the iPhone-maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qe8U0"&gt;“We all appreciate app stores and the roles that Apple and Google have played in helping to create many of the technologies that have defined our age,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, chair of the subcommittee, said on Wednesday. “We’re not angry about success... It’s about new products coming on. It’s about new competitors emerging. This situation, to me, doesn’t seem like that’s happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6GEOwR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pyU24Q"&gt;Sen. Klobuchar, who chairs the committee, is using these hearings to build support for her Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Act, which &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/senator-klobuchar-introduces-sweeping-bill-to-promote-competition-and-improve-antitrust-enforcement"&gt;she introduced in February&lt;/a&gt;. The bill’s provisions don’t line up perfectly with the App Store problem, but there are a few key provisions that would make it easier for companies like Tile to push back against Apple. In particular, the bill would make it less difficult for law enforcement to bring cases against tech companies for engaging in “exclusionary” conduct, something Sen. Klobuchar has been eager to highlight in interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0S7kA"&gt;“I don’t think people realize there’s this 15 to 30 percent tax on major companies people enjoy getting music from, like Spotify, that Apple or Google assesses, that there’s all this exclusionary conduct going on,” Klobuchar &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/senate-targets-apples-tight-app-store-reins-19bee492-bf13-4112-b3de-b0baeeb81b8f.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6GKPtd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They are fighting so hard because it’s core to the maintenance of their monopoly”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqu77n"&gt;For the most part, the companies giving testimony seemed happy to agree. Throughout the hearing, all three representatives argued that legislation is necessary for companies like Apple to change their behavior. But Spotify and Tile argued that the committee should also look into proposing federal legislation specifically targeting app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZxDjp"&gt;“We respectfully request that some consideration be given to app stores right now,” Tile’s Daru said in light of discussion over Klobuchar’s larger bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyAQy4"&gt;Outside of federal legislation, states like Arizona have introduced their own measures to make developer-friendly changes to Google and Apple’s app stores. Many of these bills, like Arizona’s, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22357121/arizona-hb2005-app-store-bill-dead-apple-google-big-tech-lobbying"&gt;have failed following intense lobbying&lt;/a&gt; efforts by tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbI3M2"&gt;“They are fighting so hard because it’s core to the maintenance of their monopoly,” Sine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8SL72e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HIGHLIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="K79ERn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346828/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-biden-nomination-facebook-google-doj-garland"&gt;Biden’s nominee&lt;/a&gt; to be the next Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission is also ready to turn up the heat on the App Store. At Lina Khan’s &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/4/nomination-hearing"&gt;confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, Klobuchar asked Khan about the power companies like Apple and Google have in regards to their app stores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hcnZF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khan: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s really the source of the power. Basically, there’s two main options so that gives these companies the power to really set the term in this market in some cases. I think you’re absolutely right that certain terms and conditions really lack any type of beneficial justifications. So, I think in those cases we need to be especially skeptical and really look closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O3cXgJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M4e0Mv"&gt;Earlier this year, Klobuchar said that the committee would hold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338763/facebook-google-antitrust-cicilline-ftc-slaughter-monopoly"&gt;a series of hearings&lt;/a&gt; aimed at competition in the tech sector, including Facebook and Google’s dominance in the ad market. The hearings have yet to be scheduled. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple targeted in $50 million ransomware attack resulting in unprecedented schematic leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBYgVBc3Ek8Dec1w5qjVOtYcv8g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165959/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ApmGF9"&gt;Apple has been targeted in a $50 million ransomware attack following the theft of a trove of engineering and manufacturing schematics of current and future products from Quanta, a Taiwan-based company that manufactures MacBooks and other products for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJXze0"&gt;The leak, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/ransomware-gang-tries-to-extort-apple-hours-ahead-of-spring-loaded-event/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was carried out by REvil, a Russian hacking group that’s also known by the name Sodinokibi. The group had already begun posting the stolen images on April 20th, timed specifically to coincide with Apple’s latest “Spring Loaded” event, after Quanta refused to pay the $50 million ransom for the data. The group is now hoping to get Apple itself to pay up by May 1st, promising to continue to post new images from the leak daily until it does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsdD19"&gt;Quanta has confirmed that its servers were breached &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/apple-targeted-in-50-million-ransomware-hack-of-supplier-quanta"&gt;in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, commenting: “Quanta Computer’s information security team has worked with external IT experts in response to cyber attacks on a small number of Quanta servers.” Quanta also says “there’s no material impact on the company’s business operation” as a result of the hack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1jVkRa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The documents appear to be accurate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="knvHRM"&gt;REvil has a history of similar ransomware attacks, &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; points out, with the group also carrying out similar hacks on &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-giant-acer-hit-by-50-million-ransomware-attack/"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leading-cosmetics-group-pierre-fabre-hit-with-25-million-ransomware-attack/"&gt;other companies&lt;/a&gt; in the past several months. But the Quanta attack — by virtue of its connection to Apple and the potential to reveal unannounced Apple hardware — marks the group’s highest-profile target yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7QZvI"&gt;The company hasn’t clarified the extent of the leak yet, but images leaked by REvil so far include schematics for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Apple’s just-revealed iMac redesign&lt;/a&gt; — which, prior to yesterday, hadn’t been seen by anyone outside of Apple’s sphere of influence, lending credence to the fact that the documents are indeed accurate. The schematics also include warnings on nearly every page: “This is the property of Apple and it must be returned,” and they specify that the documents are not to be reproduced, copied, or published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA7P5h"&gt;Also contained within the revealed files are manufacturing diagrams for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s already-released 2020 M1 MacBook Air refresh&lt;/a&gt; and an as-yet-unreleased laptop that features additional ports in line with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;existing rumors for the upcoming laptop refresh&lt;/a&gt; from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEGHhr"&gt;These documents were stolen and are being leaked to extort Apple and Quanta. Due to the nature of their origin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/12/7384871/why-were-reporting-on-sony-leak-hack-ethics-mpaa"&gt;we believe it would be unethical&lt;/a&gt; to extensively report on their contents. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment and will update this post with any new information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s new keyboard for the M1 iPad makes it more MacBook-like than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLmXH6d9BXFWlQZZxe4MTGLxlcA=/55x0:1045x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165808/BRY_129_MAX_Plus_filler_01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6W9KkO"&gt;Brydge is announcing a keyboard and trackpad accessory for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/21/brydge-unveils-new-max-keyboard-trackpad-combo-for-12-9-inch-ipad-pro/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;the company’s previous accessories&lt;/a&gt;, the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus will let you take your iPad from being a tablet to a laptop, just by connecting it to the accessory. With Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;new M1-powered iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, some might already be thinking about using it to make a MacBook replacement, while others may just be excited for the way you can now neatly attach it via magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qznUJg"&gt;The answer to whether this will help replace your MacBook with an iPad is more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;what it’s always been&lt;/a&gt;: it depends on whether you can do all your work with what’s available on iPadOS. The iPad Pro has been more powerful than a lot of MacBooks for years, but hardware is only part of the equation. While the 12.9-inch iPad Pro may now have a processor as fast as a MacBook’s and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;a better screen&lt;/a&gt; to boot, it’s still using an OS that, for some, won’t be able to fully take advantage of those features. If you’re fine with the limitations of iPadOS, then the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus could be a new solution for taking the iPad into laptop mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AddzH"&gt;The iPad will attach to the new Max Plus magnetically, instead of using the clamp system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;used by previous Brydge keyboards&lt;/a&gt;. That system required you to wedge your expensive tablet between clamps that then held onto that breakable glass — a nerve-wracking and not terribly pleasant experience. This brings Brydge’s offering more in line with the Magic Keyboard, and users will likely appreciate increased ease in switching between laptop and tablet mode. Easy, magnetic attachment is something that’s generally been associated with Apple’s iPad keyboards instead of third-party ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaE9AZ"&gt;While Brydge’s built-in trackpads have generally not compared favorably to Apple’s, the company is hoping to change that by adding native multitouch support. With the Max Plus, Brydge is also playing the size comparison game — its trackpad is the largest on an iPad keyboard, according to the company’s site. That may be a nice bonus if you’re the type of person who likes to use the mouse a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLuQap"&gt;The Brydge 12.9 Max Plus is available for preorder &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-12-9-max-plus%3Fvariant%3D39379780075625&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Brydge’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s expected to ship in June. It comes in three color options (space gray, silver, and white) and costs $249.99 — $100 cheaper than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJQJ3LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11-inch-3rd-generation-and-ipad-air-4th-generation-us-english&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is now letting everyone tweet pictures in 4K on Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VY-VwER3PIt-1bIIRkD8_ZY7cig=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165104/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5PsRbk"&gt;Get ready for Twitter to start looking a whole lot crisper — starting today, the company is letting all users tweet (and view) pictures in 4K on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwChR2"&gt;Twitter’s web app already supports higher-resolution images (at up to 4096 x 4096 resolution), but the mobile apps had been limited to just half that, with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 2048. The company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;previously started testing&lt;/a&gt; the 4K image upload option for mobile users earlier this year, and it seems those tests went well, as its now rolling out the feature to all users starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VlbVFU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter tries to fix problematic image crops by not cropping pictures anymore","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="A4zU7W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Time to Tweet those high res pics –– the option to upload and view 4K images on Android and iOS is now available for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start uploading and viewing images in 4K, update your high-quality image preferences in “Data usage” settings. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XDnWOji3nx"&gt;https://t.co/XDnWOji3nx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1384945690304995330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp7iRF"&gt;In order to enable the new feature, users will have to go to the “data usage” section of the settings menu in the Twitter app and enable both “high-quality images” (for viewing 4K images) and “high-quality image uploads” (for tweeting them). Users can select whether they’d like the higher-resolution images to be enabled for both cellular and Wi-Fi, just Wi-Fi, or disabled entirely — similar options to how Twitter handles higher resolution or auto-playing video. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple now lets you extend a Mac’s AppleCare Plus coverage beyond three years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_ORDh_fFd5xujzyMXk79_D36Co=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164763/vpavic_191118_3800_0201.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RfzyHE"&gt;Apple’s Mac computers typically come with a one-year warranty that you can optionally extend to three years by purchasing AppleCare Plus. The extended warranty also adds coverage for accidents and physical damage. But now, Apple is giving Mac customers the choice to keep AppleCare Plus going for even longer than the usual three-year limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mxt5D7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/applecare-for-mac-extended-coverage/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;As noticed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210580"&gt;a new support page&lt;/a&gt; that confirms people in the United States can convert AppleCare Plus into an indefinite annual subscription once the coverage they paid for upfront lapses. Apple says the recurring annual coverage must be purchased “within 30 days of the end date of your original coverage.” Once you’ve moved to annual billing, it renews automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AL5T5f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More peace of mind for you, more revenue for Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T2Naeg"&gt;AppleCare Plus covers up to two incidents of accidental damage each year. Accident claims require a $99 deductible for a damaged display or external damage. More severe damage (like water incidents) have a deductible of $299. Either way, it’s far cheaper than paying for out-of-warranty repairs or buying a new Mac altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y61QbH"&gt;Presumably this new policy means that Apple will continue to support covered Macs for as long as it has repair parts for a given machine. Part of Apple’s terms and conditions on this says the company will automatically cancel your plan (and provide 60 days’ notice) if it doesn’t have the necessary parts anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaZ4JT"&gt;AppleCare Plus falls under Apple’s services division, so giving customers the option to stretch out their warranties means more peace of mind for them — and more revenue for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Md6NwZ"&gt;Apple’s extended warranty for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch can also be converted into  continued monthly coverage for customers who bought upfront coverage, which normally covers those products for a total of two years. As with the Mac, the renewing coverage must be purchased within 30 days of the original coverage end date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple approved another secret gambling den, masquerading as a puzzle game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRo5vHfFyT2XXx-D65QpbOI_JIw=/113x0:1531x945/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164172/kosta_gambling_den_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xS4HkY"&gt;This morning, I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;how Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching incredibly obvious multimillion-dollar scams&lt;/a&gt; because the company isn’t even bothering to audit its most profitable apps for fraud, and how app developer Kosta Eleftheriou is showing the company how it’s done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Qb4Ts"&gt;But that’s not the only kind of scam Eleftheriou has been uncovering in Apple’s App Store — he has also discovered that Apple’s review teams have been approving games that transform into secret gambling dens when you access them from certain countries (or via VPN). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;We wrote about two of them last Thursday&lt;/a&gt; as if they were an isolated incident, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407589539115011"&gt;he’s now found at least two more&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting this may be a trend — including a match-three puzzle game dubbed &lt;em&gt;Lucky Stars&lt;/em&gt; that turns into a casino if you open it in Russia, and a game called &lt;em&gt;Vegas Pirates&lt;/em&gt; that does the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ch7YAx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; app pretends to be a game for kids 4+, but if you are in Russia (or use a VPN) it becomes an online casino that doesn’t even use Apple’s in-app-purchase system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppleEvent&lt;/a&gt; scam of the day  &lt;a href="https://t.co/VU1XpaiILU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VU1XpaiILU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407589539115011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="5AdBtR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The developer - “Marina Misko” - has several gambling apps, all posing as games for kids 4+  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These have been on the App Store for several months, and even had multiple updates approved by Apple! &lt;a href="https://t.co/iE8pbljeh9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iE8pbljeh9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407629493989378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XeDpim"&gt;In some ways, they’re even more egregious examples: while it might be more shocking that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;a kids’ monkey-collecting-bananas game would transform into a gambling den&lt;/a&gt;, these new apps would seem to invite extra scrutiny with their gambling-oriented visuals and the fact they pretended a Russian news organization was their “developer website.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DkyAQM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The developer’s website listed on the App Store is &lt;a href="https://t.co/mHYeXEn8dV"&gt;https://t.co/mHYeXEn8dV&lt;/a&gt;, a big Russian news outlet. Really.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even the *privacy policy* link they’ve provided to Apple is the same exact link - and Apple has happily accepted all this! &lt;a href="https://t.co/QIgMg78cnf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QIgMg78cnf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407638666989573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RlT9fG"&gt;They’re both gone now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrE0QV"&gt;If you’re looking for shock value, Eleftheriou also spotted this unrelated app the other day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q37FIo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Curated by the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;, for your kids’ safety!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/wFJOc0FeDQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wFJOc0FeDQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384561527387131904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IaTG06"&gt;Apple is testifying before Congress today — and in an incredibly high-profile court case against Epic Games next month — about how its App Store protects users, justifies the company’s traditional 30-percent cut (reportedly $64 billion last year alone), and shouldn’t be broken up. These kinds of discoveries are giving the company’s critics a lot of ammo.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirTags will work with Android... sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in a blue, leather holster, attached to a black bag." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCSMVEWYmDfbODYngQNfZfM47FA=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163879/Apple_airtag_accessories_bag_042021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An AirTag. | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6Gqeg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt; have one feature not mentioned during the announcement yesterday: they’ll work with Android to a limited extent. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/20/lost-airtag-can-be-read-by-any-other-nfc-enabled-iphone-or-android-device/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;support article&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s site that details how AirTags will work with an Android device if you don’t have your iPhone handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k02FLB"&gt;The way AirTags function is by securely communicating with Bluetooth devices and iPhones equipped with ultra-wideband that are in the area. If AirTags exclusively worked with Apple devices it would severely limit their effectiveness, particularly in regions where iPhones aren’t as popular as Android. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A moving image of a phone tapping an AirTag and a link appearing in the notifications on the phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yinUHviyNXw9xFiPoJMZhbSjFrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459713/ios14_iphone12_pro_nfc_notification_animation_crop.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any NFC-equipped phone should be able to just tap the AirTag to get more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9sFmtd"&gt;AirTags won’t work out of the box with an Android device, nor can you use an Android device in lieu of an iPhone with one. Instead, it will only work with Android devices equipped with NFC and only communicate when the AirTags are in Lost Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93EfhH"&gt;First, you’ll need to use your iPhone to activate Lost Mode, which is supposed to show you on a map where your AirTag has wandered off to. Then if someone with an Android device finds your lost AirTag, they can hold it up to their NFC-equipped phone and get details on how to contact you. They’ll only be able to get details if the Lost Mode is activated, which should help with privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZskdY"&gt;The Android support makes AirTags way more useful, but if you want the full experience on an Android device, you’ll probably want to take a gander at Tile’s offerings. The company is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;working on an AirTag competitor&lt;/a&gt; that should work on both iOS and Android. Samsung also has its own AirTag competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Galaxy SmartTags&lt;/a&gt;. Like the AirTags and planned Tile offering, the Galaxy SmartTags use UWB to provide a more exact location for a lost tag. The Galaxy SmartTags only work with Samsung Galaxy phones, but unlike AirTags and the Tile tag, Galaxy SmartTags are available now and start at $29.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL9XiQ"&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big iPad, Mini LED: why Apple’s new iPad Pro display is better and brighter</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6EkwEH"&gt;Apple’s latest iPad Pro might look very similar to the model it’s replacing, but it contains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;several major upgrades on the inside&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got the same powerful, energy-efficient M1 chip as the latest MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and now the redesigned iMac. Cellular models have made the jump to 5G. The front-facing camera can zoom and pan to keep you in focus on video calls. But aside from the processor, the biggest technical leap is exclusive to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro: it’s what Apple calls the “Liquid Retina XDR,” a new display that adopts Mini LED backlighting to achieve higher brightness and greater contrast than any iPad (or Mac) that the company has ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNYMdt"&gt;Apple says the 12.9-inch iPad Pro can reach 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness — on par with the ultra-expensive Pro Display XDR — and portions of the screen can hit an eye-searing 1,600 nits when playing HDR content. That’s brighter than many 4K HDR TVs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLF1Xe"&gt;For comparison’s sake, the previous iPad Pro topped out at 600 nits. Full stop. These measurements also obliterate Apple’s Mac lineup. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can go up to 500 nits. The flashy 24-inch iMac introduced yesterday? Also 500 nits. Things move a little closer when you look at the iPhone 12 Pro’s OLED screen, which can hit a max brightness of 800 nits and 1,200 in HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbvOqZ"&gt;But Apple isn’t yet ready to make the switch to OLED for its tablets, and the reasoning probably comes down to the brightness advantage of Mini LED — plus the company’s promise that this iPad Pro, with its fancy display, still has the standard 10-hour battery life that iPad users have come to expect. Either way, this is an upgrade that should be plainly evident to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="20XTTP"&gt;What is Mini LED?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FRsI6s"&gt;Unlike OLED, where individual pixels are self-illuminating and can fully turn off when not needed, Mini LED is more of a natural progression from the LCD screens that have become such a mainstay of consumer electronics. But where this new approach differentiates itself is in the size and quantity of LEDs behind the screen. During its Spring Loaded event, Apple’s Heidi Delgado said that the previous iPad Pro had 72 LEDs, but the new “Liquid Retina XDR” manages to pack in over 10,000 of them. Apple accomplished this by miniaturizing the LEDs to a size “120 times smaller in volume than the previous design.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TynE4-W6Ht5SEGThE4vS914xSVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459379/MiniLED.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says the 12.9-inch iPad Pro has over 10,000 LEDs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9enWaW"&gt;The Mini LEDs are grouped into over 2,500 local dimming zones that can individually brighten and dim based on whatever’s being shown on the display. This granular level of control, according to Delgado, results in customers “seeing the brightest highlights along with subtle details in the darkest parts of an image.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UY5ocq8wXmPsr70iTw_OQ_biAp4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459369/Zones.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dimming zones can light up and dim based on what’s on-screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lcvwE6"&gt;Apple isn’t first to Mini LED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BW7aSj"&gt;Though this might be the first time Mini LED has found its way into a tablet, the technology has already appeared in TVs. &lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/blog/article/mini-led-technology"&gt;TCL really sparked the trend&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and apparently Samsung and LG took notice: their higher-end 2021 LCD TVs now utilize Mini LED backlighting as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1aYqdAc47IEWfHdrjCihYfXLEjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459345/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_9.36.17_AM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FOPASo"&gt;Here’s how TCL explains the visual improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JlVqsN"&gt;LED LCD TVs have two parts of the display that combine together to create an image. The “LCD” (liquid crystal display) part of the display creates a picture and the “LED” (light-emitting diode) part of the display makes light that shines through the picture so your eyes can see it. So the benefit of thousands of precisely controlled mini-LEDs in an active matrix backlight is more powerful light that is more smoothly distributed across the screen, more precisely controlled for sharp contrast and more effective in creating vividly saturated colors that dazzle the eye. Mini-LED simply delivers dramatically better picture performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iOxYD4"&gt;The huge uptick in LEDs could also result in improved panel uniformity; some owners of the previous 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uneven-backlight-on-11-ipad-pro.2154729/"&gt;have observed uneven backlighting&lt;/a&gt;. Having exchanged one or two for this very reason, I can vouch. The “panel lottery” is a thing with pretty much any device — TVs, laptops, tablets, etc. — but making the move to Mini LED should help with consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zn1jun"&gt;What’s this I hear about MicroLED?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ebps60"&gt;MicroLED is seen as the next major leap in TV display technology and the potential successor to OLED. It shares many of OLED’s best traits (like self-emissive LEDs), ups the brightness, and comes without most of the associated drawbacks since the technology is inorganic. But right now, MicroLED is extremely cost prohibitive and really only found in ultra-premium luxury TVs from Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4I43B"&gt;Final impressions on the new iPad Pro will need to wait until we get it in our hands. But as someone who uses the previous 12.9-inch model daily for productive and creative purposes, I’m very curious to see what Mini LED adds to the iPad experience.&lt;/p&gt;
