    <title>2020: bad year, good gadgets</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Game hardware and laptops both started promising new generations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="if2UI8"&gt;It doesn’t feel right to praise much of anything in 2020, but here goes: the gadgets were good. In a year when many of us have been more dependent than ever on our screens to stay connected, do our jobs, and just stay sane, the technology behind them has been better than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdyWAj"&gt;Big tech promised generational changes in consumer technology this year. The new Macs and the new gaming hardware we got in 2020 really have kicked off noticeably different and better eras in computing. I don’t like using grandiose phrases like “eras in computing,” but there’s really no other way to put it. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony, and AMD &lt;em&gt;actually delivered&lt;/em&gt; on their bombastic claims. That’s not usually how it goes. It’s a little bewildering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwVwTa"&gt;So yes, there were the usual hits and misses in this year’s gadgets, but what’s different is the hits were blockbusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7vIpR"&gt;The biggest star has to be the M1 chip in Apple’s new laptops and the Mac Mini. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;very nearly gave the MacBook Air a perfect score&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, a processor transition means app incompatibility problems that go on for years, but you have to go to strange edge cases to find apps that just don’t work. Normally, apps designed for the old chips run slow, but in some cases, they run faster on the M1. Normally, speed improvements and battery improvements are measured in single percentage points, but these laptops are astonishingly fast and last forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="UnRvkH"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="M1 MacBook Pro and Air review: Apple delivers|96773" data-volume-uuid="6412f55d2" data-volume-id="96773" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-402" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9l52"&gt;It’s hard to express what a big deal this is. More than once, we would have to double- and triple-check our test results because they seemed too good to be true. I do not know how Windows PCs are going to respond. Thus far, emulated apps that run in Windows on Arm have been slow and buggy, while Intel-based machines are unlikely to match the M1’s battery life. It’s going to be a tough row for the entire PC industry to hoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNU2EG"&gt;Then there’s the new slate of gaming hardware, which all seemed to land at once and which all seem to be impossible to find at any retail site. Before this year, getting 4K, HDR, and high refresh rates all at the same time was a stretch goal at best. After 2020, it’s accessible on PC or console (assuming you can find the hardware in stock and buy it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snHnKU"&gt;The new graphics cards from both Nvidia and AMD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;force away the trade-offs gamers usually have to make in their graphics settings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-reviewhttps://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and S&lt;/a&gt; don’t have a slate of next-gen launch titles, but they have competently and quietly made existing games run faster and look better. And they also have a ton of potential for the future with Microsoft’s Game Pass Ultimate subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="iEsayI"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="PlayStation 5 Review: a next-gen feel|96572" data-volume-uuid="eae294ab6" data-volume-id="96572" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-864" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uXiAyI"&gt;The Playstation 5, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;surprised us all by having a new controller that offers some genuinely new and engaging experiences&lt;/a&gt;. It seems weird to enthuse about haptics and trigger resistance, but you really can feel the difference. The PS5’s fundamentals as a console are also strong — though the design of course remains polarizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9kKAs"&gt;Taken as a whole, the new PC graphics cards and the new consoles really do represent the beginning of a set of next-gen gaming experiences. And unlike the last time we got a big console refresh, it doesn’t seem like any of them have significantly stumbled out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGeWA1"&gt;The phones of 2020 were also great. It’s hard to remember because it was a thousand years ago, but Samsung’s Galaxy S20 line launched in March as the first flagship 5G phones. It’s weird to suggest that anything Samsung does is quiet, but the S20 and S20 plus were just quietly the best Android phones this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TgPWVL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Samsung Galaxy S20 review: better than the Ultra|75203" data-volume-uuid="dc391ca04" data-volume-id="75203" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-439" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSFjkN"&gt;5G turned out to be the most explicit claim to making something “next generation” that did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pan out. In the US especially, 5G is only slightly better than 4G for people who can find a signal in the first place. Even so, the phones that were meant to usher in the 5G era were great — not because they had 5G, but because they were simply well-made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yabrti"&gt;The new iPhones were also great — and launched along with a confident claim that “5G is real now.” But as with Samsung’s phones, the iPhone 12 lineup is great despite 5G, not because of it. The iPhone 12 mini, in particular, finally made a top-tier phone available to people who have felt that everything since the iPhone 5S was too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GytRYJ"&gt;Hell, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 finally made good on the promise of the original&lt;/a&gt;. Overpriced and blingy? Yes. But also a really good little tablet that folds up. I know at least one &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor who I shall not name (it’s not me) who bought one and loves it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovOg71"&gt;Then there are the gadgets that don’t purport to be next-gen anything but nevertheless were simply &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG G14 Zephyrus gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;GoPro Hero 9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550181/dji-mavic-mini-2-drone-4k-price-release-date-battery-life"&gt;DJI’s Mini 2 drone getting OcuSync wireless&lt;/a&gt; and its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21517121/dji-ronin-s2-sc2-rs2-rsc2-gimbals-announced-price"&gt;Ronan gimbals getting built-in focus wheels&lt;/a&gt;; Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514758/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;Mario Kart Live Home Circuit remote control AR cars&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof S3 e-bike&lt;/a&gt;; Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;WH-1000XM4 headphones&lt;/a&gt;; and Dell’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;latest XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. Even smart speakers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; significantly improved their sound while Apple finally hit a reasonable price point with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="t6bq6y"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="The Verge’s favorite gadgets of 2020|96860" data-volume-uuid="a521f8b3f" data-volume-id="96860" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-736" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2Zovz"&gt;I wish I could tell you what ties this year’s wave of good gadgets into a coherent trend. It wouldn’t be right to tie any of this to the pandemic — the lead times on everything mentioned here are such that they would have begun development well before lockdown. Certainly there was an effort to make “next-gen” products feel worthy of the description, but I don’t think that explains it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GdJ5B3"&gt;If I’m honest, I think it’s just luck. A bunch of technologies happened to mature around the same time and a bunch of companies happened to be ready to do something with them. In a year when so many things have gone predictably bad, it’s nice that this one small thing was unpredictably nice. The gadgets were good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDBY5b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KP7G9F"&gt;Workers at an iPhone production plant in India reportedly smashed windows and set fire to vehicles to protest reductions in pay, the &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/violence-breaks-out-at-wistron-corps-iphone-manufacturing-plant-near-bengaluru/articleshow/79691511.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times of India &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The incidents began Saturday at a facility run by Taiwan manufacturing company Wistron Corporation, where the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/24/iphone-se-assembled-in-india/"&gt; iPhone SE is assembled.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIUGQr"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/angry-at-delayed-payments-employees-ransack-narsapura-plant-where-iphones-are-made-7102392/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian Express&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; during a shift change workers who said they had seen their pay reduced damaged the offices, some furniture, and factory equipment before things escalated outside. A local official told the &lt;em&gt;Express &lt;/em&gt;that police were investigating the incident. About 2,000 workers were involved in the protest. &lt;/p&gt;

However, it only has about a 1 percent share of the total smartphone market in the country, since the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-apple-wistron/apple-supplier-wistron-to-assemble-key-iphone-component-in-new-india-plant-sources-idUSKBN1ZX0F6"&gt;iPhone’s price tag puts it out of reach&lt;/a&gt; for many Indian consumers. &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/india-surpassed-usa-become-second-largest-smartphone-market-world-reaching-158-million-shipments-2019/"&gt;India was the second-biggest smartphone market&lt;/a&gt; in the world in 2019, ahead of the US and second only to China.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iPhone has an aggravating text notifications bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nxqCkC8QD0tyrV9CGDhB2Hs0MDE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68498188/akrales_201018_4238_0435.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FqOH0y"&gt;If you’ve noticed that you’re receiving SMS texts and iMessages from people but aren’t getting any notifications about them, you’re not alone. Far from it. I’m one of many people experiencing an annoying bug where messages come through fine — but without any pop-up notification or even the usual red badge to indicate that there’s a new message waiting to be read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsOeVu"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/13/iphone-12-missing-sms-text-messages/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; wrote about increasing reports of the problem&lt;/a&gt; on the new iPhone 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max phones. But it seems to also be affecting people with older iPhones as well, so this is looking more and more like an iOS 14 issue. What’s more aggravating about the glitch is that it doesn't &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; happen. I’ve noticed some messages pop up on my lock screen like normal, but others just quietly roll in with me being none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfDAlB"&gt;People in that very large &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; thread have tried to come up with workarounds like turning off Messages on a Mac, or deleting and re-adding contacts. Some are noticing they get notifications if they completely force close the Messages app every time after sending a text. And in other cases, the missing notifications are only happening for pinned conversations, and unpinning contacts seems to do the trick. There are sporadic reports of success with these short-term fixes, but they aren’t working for everyone. There’s also &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251815788"&gt;this 42-page thread on the company’s support forums&lt;/a&gt; about the ongoing frustrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o91b1E"&gt;Those dealing with the issue are understandably disappointed that Apple hasn’t released a thorough fix yet. This is pretty fundamental stuff, and it’s probably causing some awkward conversations between couples or friends when messages just sit there for hours without the recipient knowing they came. And if you’re hoping that all will be well when iOS 14.3 releases next week, I wouldn’t be so sure. Early reports indicate that the no-text-notifications bug remains present — at least in some cases — in the second release candidate build of iOS 14.3 that Apple pushed out to public beta testers yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A4RJ9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Apple for more information on the status of this bug and the company’s plans to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Apple are banning technology for sharing users’ location data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5KvBPc2-u8EerPigOQpDLLmZy8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68498063/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SWMuy4"&gt;You may have never heard of the company X-Mode Social, but its code may be in some of the apps on your phone, tracking and selling your location data. Now, Google and Apple are trying to put a stop to it. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-and-google-to-stop-x-mode-from-collecting-location-data-from-users-phones-11607549061"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;, the tech companies have told developers to remove X-Mode’s code from their apps, or risk getting them pulled from their respective app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7JPFi"&gt;X-Mode works by giving developers code to put into their apps, known as an SDK, which tracks users’ location and then sends that data to X-Mode, which sells it. In return, X-Mode pays the developer a certain amount based on how many users the app has. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj454d/private-intelligence-location-data-xmode-hyas"&gt;According to the company&lt;/a&gt;, its technology is in over 400 apps, including many apps designed for Muslim users, such as one that reminds users when to pray, and a Muslim-focused dating app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snhtj4"&gt;Apple is giving developers two weeks to remove the SDK, and Google is giving devs one week, with the ability to apply for an extension to 30 days. But the model of tracking users’ locations and selling the data is nothing new: what may have gotten X-Mode banned was that, according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x"&gt;it was also selling it to the US military&lt;/a&gt;. When you consider the fact that many of the largest apps using the X-Mode were designed for Muslim populations, it’s understandable why this would be concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6t6IR"&gt;Of course, government services buying citizens’ location data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371886/secret-service-usss-locate-x-babel-street-foia-contract-report"&gt;is nothing new&lt;/a&gt;, but most of the time they buy it from data brokers, who just aggregate the information from various sources, not from companies collecting it directly. For its part, X-Mode claims it’s being singled out, saying that it “collects similar mobile app data as most advertising SDKs”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq5GkD"&gt;To wrap this up with a PSA: X-Mode, and other companies like it, can only get your location data when given permission. Often apps don’t make it clear that your location data is going to X-Mode (it’s either buried in a EULA, or not there at all), but every app on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21005009/iphone-location-tracking-how-to-on-off-apps-apple-find-my-friends"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372603/google-android-location-sharing-maps-how-to-enable-disable"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; will have to ask for permission to be able to see your location. If your level app (as in, the tool you use to make sure a picture isn’t crooked) is asking for permission for your location, it’s probably worth thinking about whether or not it actually needs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jncKIU"&gt;Of course, that won’t protect you in cases where the app has an actual reason to use your location (such as with a dating app), which is why it’s good that both Apple and Google, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917988/ron-wyden-facebook-privacy-data-regulation-do-not-track"&gt;some lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;, are starting to take a harder look at how companies sell user data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qRJqhM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Americans are sick and tired of their data being misused and abused by anyone with a checkbook. Apple and Google deserve credit for doing the right thing here, but there’s still more work to be done to protect Americans’ privacy. &lt;a href="https://t.co/AirdebtLFx"&gt;https://t.co/AirdebtLFx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1337088182068760576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Apple’s old 29W chargers aren’t good enough for MagSafe Duo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aKC8xJQE0JxirWITjx_iRneaXqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68495649/dbohn_201109_4283_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="px1WFU"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211925"&gt;Apple support page&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that the company’s new MagSafe Duo wireless charger, which is designed to charge an iPhone and Apple Watch simultaneously, isn’t compatible with its older 29W USB-C power adapter. If you’re using an Apple power adapter it’s best to use one of the company’s newer 30W models, which &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/04/apple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter/"&gt;replaced the 29W model in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and retail for $49. It’s an unfortunate revelation for anyone with the old chargers since the MagSafe Duo doesn’t come with a charging brick in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rogl9"&gt;Apple’s page doesn’t say exactly what happens if you plug the MagSafe Duo into one of the older 29W bricks. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/magsafe-duo-incompatible-with-apple-29w-charger/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that if you do it will only be able to charge a single device, an iPhone or an Apple Watch, rather than both at once. Although the 29W brick appears to meet the wattage requirements of the MagSafe Duo, it apparently doesn’t support the exact combination of volts and amps required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3VkLm6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Working out MagSafe’s charging speeds is a little complicated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WRBh1x"&gt;At this point, working out how fast each of Apple’s MagSafe accessories will charge your devices is a little bit complicated. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHXH3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F11%2F22169285%2Fapple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-brick-magsafe-duo-incompatible#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt; charges iPhones at up to 15W, and Apple recommends pairing it with a $19 Apple 20W USB-C power adapter. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHXF3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-duo-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F11%2F22169285%2Fapple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-brick-magsafe-duo-incompatible#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Duo charger&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, offers up to a slightly lower 14W of charging when paired with a 27W or higher brick, so long as that brick supports 9V/3A. You get 11W of charging by pairing it with a 20W power brick that supports 9V/2.22A, and Apple says you need “at least 15W (5V/3A or 9V/1.67A)” for the Duo to charge two devices simultaneously. If you’re charging an iPhone 12 mini, the maximum charge is capped at 12W with the Duo. Oh, and the maximum charge is also capped at 7.5W if you’re charging your phone with a Lightning accessory (like a pair of headphones) plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kteyRr"&gt;Plenty of devices have very specific requirements for the hardware you need to use to get the fastest charging speeds, so it’s hard to blame Apple too much here. But I think we can all agree that it could have made things much simpler for customers if it included a power brick in the box with its $129 wireless charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7ia5VA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Apple MagSafe Duo charger is overpriced and under-delivers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple is now building the chip it needs to ditch Qualcomm like it ditched Intel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_k5lr6Yj4Zrztex-aGj00KL0v4w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494405/acastro_170731_1777_0005_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wlq4QB"&gt;This fall, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;changed how we thought about laptops overnight&lt;/a&gt;. It replaced the Intel processors in its MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with its own homegrown ARM chips instead — and though we were initially skeptical about Apple’s silicon transition, the final product &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;blew us away&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9O24bs"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/apple-starts-work-on-its-own-cellular-modem-chip-chief-says?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s chip chief has internally revealed that a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; chip transition is also already in the early stages: a cellular modem that could mean far less need (if any) for Qualcomm chips in Apple’s products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JwfE6"&gt;“This year, we kicked off the development of our first internal cellular modem which will enable another key strategic transition,” Apple hardware SVP Johny Srouji reportedly said, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RRLybX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s only a matter of time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbRI5t"&gt;If you’ve been following Apple’s struggles with Intel and Qualcomm, this won’t come as much of a surprise: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;Apple bought Intel’s smartphone modem business last July&lt;/a&gt;, which strongly suggested it was only a matter of time before Apple used that purchase to develop its own radio chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fDF3T"&gt;Qualcomm has more than physical radio chips going for it, of course; it also has a tremendous amount of intellectual property around cellular that it licenses to companies like Apple (and has been accused of using in anticompetitive ways, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363629/qualcomm-win-appeal-antitrust-ftc-lawsuit-frand-patents-chips"&gt;it recently won an antitrust suit&lt;/a&gt; against the FTC). Ahead of Apple’s purchase of Intel’s modem business, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18411332/intel-exiting-5g-smartphone-modem-market-apple-qualcomm-settle-dispute"&gt;it reached a surprise settlement with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; over patent infringement and struck a multiyear deal around the companies’ wireless IP — one where it wound up paying Qualcomm $4.5 billion, and where Apple wound up getting the Qualcomm chips it needed to build this year’s 5G iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQdu4U"&gt;With its own cellular radios, Apple could at least be less reliant on Qualcomm. At best, it could build a better performing radio and offer better battery life, like it did with its new ARM chips vs. Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvF4Xc"&gt;To be honest, the most surprising thing about the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is that an Apple town hall meeting leaked &lt;em&gt;at all, &lt;/em&gt;considering how secretive the company typically is. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/apple-s-cook-says-most-staff-won-t-return-to-office-until-june"&gt;when employees might return to the company’s physical offices&lt;/a&gt; during that meeting, saying it “seems likely” that most teams won’t return before June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cydia sues Apple alleging its App Store has a monopoly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JLXcNOYkab9yhLKyNXchk1tCBCY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492814/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUF9BT"&gt;A new lawsuit from the creator of jailbroken iOS app store Cydia claims Apple used anti-competitive tactics that froze out Cydia and other would-be rivals when it created its App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SM9vdW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160777/cydia_sues_apple.pdf"&gt;Apple, the lawsuit states&lt;/a&gt;, “began coercing users to utilize no other iOS app distribution service but the App Store, coupling it closer and closer to the iPhone itself in order to crowd out all competition.” The company is seeking a jury trial and unspecified monetary damages: “This lawsuit seeks to open the markets for iOS app distribution and iOS app payment processing to those who wish to compete fairly with Apple, and to recover the enormous damages Apple caused.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jjFL8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saurik"&gt;Software developer Jay Freeman&lt;/a&gt; launched Cydia in 2007, before Apple had established the App Store. After the launch of the App Store, Cydia became a way for users to install apps, tweaks, and software that hadn’t been approved by Apple. The lawsuit alleges that the early iPhones were limited in functionality and came with “only a handful of Apple apps,” and they were not able to install third-party software or additional apps. Over the years, Apple made it more difficult to jailbreak iPhones and, the lawsuit alleges, discouraged developers from using non-Apple app stores. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/16/18143422/cydia-disables-in-app-purchases-ios-jailbreak-store-apple-iphone"&gt;Cydia shut down new purchases&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vsg5T"&gt;Cydia’s lawsuit, first &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/10/cydia-apple-lawsuit/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, claims that Apple now has a monopoly over iOS software distribution. “Were it not for Apple’s anticompetitive acquisition and maintenance of an illegal monopoly over iOS app distribution, users today would actually be able to choose how and where to locate and obtain iOS apps, and developers would be able to use the iOS app distributor of their choice,” according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wofQOR"&gt;Apple says it plans to review the lawsuit and continues to discourage people from jailbreaking iPhones for security reasons. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Finternetsecurity-mobile-android-vs-ios-which-is-more-secure.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167964%2Fcydia-sues-apple-monopoly-anticompetitive-iphone#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 study from antivirus company Norton&lt;/a&gt; found that Apple’s stringent controls over what apps are allowed into the App Store made iOS devices somewhat more secure than those running the more popular &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/"&gt;open-source Android&lt;/a&gt; operating system. However, the US Copyright Office has established that iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/jailbreaking-not-crime-tell-copyright-office-free-your-devices"&gt;jailbreaking is not illegal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5mD8q"&gt;Cydia is the latest company to allege Apple has engaged in anti-competitive behavior. In August, Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;introduced a new direct payment system&lt;/a&gt; in its popular &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;game&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to bypass Apple’s 30 percent fee. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off&lt;/a&gt; the App Store for violating its rules, and Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;responded with a civil lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Apple, alleging that the iPhone maker was violating antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHsLb9"&gt;A judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21492334/epic-fortnite-apple-lawsuit-restraining-order-unreal-engine"&gt;granted an injunction&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Apple from retaliating against Epic’s Unreal Engine platform, but refused to grant an injunction that would have restored &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in Apple’s App Store. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427779/apple-epic-games-breach-of-contract-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store"&gt;said it would seek damages&lt;/a&gt; against Epic for allegedly breaching its contract with the iOS App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHSB18"&gt;In September, several companies that have criticized Apple — including Epic, Spotify, Basecamp, Match Group, Tile, Blix, and Deezer — created the &lt;a href="https://appfairness.org/"&gt;Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/a&gt; to “create a level playing field for app businesses and give people freedom of choice on their devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFASqY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBQQF3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY5zML"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple discontinues Music Memos app with one final update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNYN4m9slp1e2j8Zj49JFyKaW8U=/222x0:2418x1464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492493/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_2.26.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h5INn4"&gt;In 2016, Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/20/10797250/apple-music-memo-app-announced-iphone-ipad-free"&gt;a new iPhone app called Music Memos&lt;/a&gt;. It was meant to expand on the built-in Voice Memos app’s ease of use while adding some features for musicians. You could record something with an acoustic guitar or piano in uncompressed audio, and Music Memos would detect the chords you played and could also add in drum and bass backing tracks that kept with your tempo. You could name those tracks and give them star ratings, or tag certain parts of a recording like the bridge or chorus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0LQUK"&gt;But considering how infrequently Apple updated Music Memos after its release, it’s fair to assume that the app never took off like the company might’ve hoped. It was an awkward middle child between the wonderfully simple Voice Memos and more capable GarageBand. And today, as noted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/10/apple-music-memos-voice-memos-integration/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has confirmed that Music Memos won’t be getting any further updates. The one released today, version 1.0.7 — we never even made it to 1.1, folks — allows users to export their Music Memos recordings to Voice Memos. You can still export tracks to GarageBand just like before, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gvmWZx"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple Music Memos makes mobile recording easy|6279" data-volume-uuid="774e98a08" data-volume-id="6279" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-681" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s all take a trip back in time and rewatch our 2016 video about Music Memos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dyiE5Y"&gt;You’ll now see a “Recording is moving to Voice Memos” prompt when you open Music Memos. Tapping “export” will send all of your stuff over to Voice Memos in a folder labeled Music Memos. You can also just tap “OK” to dismiss the export reminder for another week. If you create new recordings with Music Memos after exporting, just remember to copy those over as well. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211824"&gt;Here’s an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on the transition process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lq9KL"&gt;Apple says that Music Memos will be unavailable to download after March 1st, 2021 for new users; if you’ve already installed it previously, it’ll remain available in your App Store library. But it won’t be getting any further development — not that it had received much attention in years anyway. Apple made a few bare minimum updates to the app in the past, adding support for new iPhone display resolutions and so on, but that’s pretty much it. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmusic-memos%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22168102%2Fapple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s the website for the app&lt;/a&gt;, but it might not be around for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="833z64"&gt;There are a lot of great smartphone options available at any given moment, so it can be a challenge to sort through them all if you’re trying to choose the absolute best one. The stakes here can’t be understated: your phone is the most important gadget in your life, and you’ll probably be living with the one you buy for at least a year, if not two or three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQGOEA"&gt;Most of the time, the best phone stands out from the pack in all the areas that matter: performance, value, camera, and support. And most of the time, that’s usually the most expensive phone on the market. But as it turns out, you don’t have to buy the priciest phone to get the best experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0USm3"&gt;This guide focuses on the best phones on the market, regardless of price. If you’re looking for something on a smaller budget, please &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bEJfKg"&gt;There are many new iPhones to choose from this year, each with different characteristics and prices. The one that most people should buy is the iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5fl1U"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro, but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five different colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2sVfnG"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good — you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XJXAT"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something most people won’t miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR video for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1vQlwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9527699"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eK0QNl"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Y0X1g"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJZ9AM"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zwDSsW"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21172039/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-review-camera-5g-screen-android"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S20 / S20 Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qLPa8Y"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4xfZgU"&gt;If you’re looking for an Android phone, the one that we recommend for most people is Samsung’s Galaxy S20 and S20 Plus. Even though these models came out way back in March 2020, they still balance performance, features, design, and build quality better than anything else you can get right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPUenF"&gt;The S20 devices have excellent performance and great battery life. They have 120Hz displays that make every interaction as smooth as it can be. They also support 5G networks, just like any other flagship phone this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2S71nF"&gt;Both models have standard, ultrawide, and telephoto cameras on the rear, which provide a lot of flexibility when you’re composing photos. They may not be quite as good as the cameras you can get on an iPhone 12 or 12 Pro Max, but they are still very good and most people will find they take excellent photos and video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JEKgzH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The S20 and S20 Plus have the right mix of performance, design, and features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t0nxLN"&gt;Samsung actually has another model in the S20 line that’s larger and more expensive than the S20 or S20 Plus: the S20 Ultra. We don’t recommend it: its camera system looks more advanced on a spec sheet but is less reliable and not as enjoyable to use and we don’t think it’s worth the extra $400 you’ll pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR9r50"&gt;Choosing between the S20 and S20 Plus comes down to basically one thing: do you want an oversized screen or not? The S20 has a large 6.2-inch screen; the S20 Plus has an enormous 6.7-inch screen. The latter will definitely be harder to use in one hand and might not slip into your pocket as easily, but the screen is gorgeous to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pt5XrR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9560504"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zGXnzc"&gt;Perhaps the best part of the S20 models is that you can get them for a good price, now that they’ve been on the market for more than six months. At launch, the S20 was about $1,000, while the S20 Plus was $1,200, both for 128GB models. But now you can regularly find the S20 in the $700 to $800 range, with the S20 Plus typically $200 more. At those prices, you can’t find a better Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9WVvG1"&gt;Rumors are pointing to Samsung releasing a new S21 model line as soon as January 2021. That can mean two things: if you are only looking for the latest and greatest, you might want to wait. But it could also mean we’ll see even more significant discounts on the S20 line than we already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="UW0Jki"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S20 FE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gzg6sU"&gt;Best midrange Android phone in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BHvw0G"&gt;The midrange phone market (models priced between $500 and $700) has exploded this year, but the one that stands out from the pack is Samsung’s Galaxy S20 FE. The reason is because it barely feels like a midrange phone; with just a couple of tweaks, this could easily pass for a premium flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0zWPa"&gt;Like the other S20 models, the FE has a 120Hz display that makes every touch, scroll, or interaction feel smooth. It also has a top-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor — you’re not giving up anything in terms of performance here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utHVpW"&gt;Its camera system has the familiar wide, ultrawide, and telephoto setup, with all three cameras having 12-megapixel sensors. In good light, they all take reliably good phones; where you’ll notice a difference between this and more expensive phones is when it starts to get dark. But Samsung’s night mode does work surprisingly well and helps out quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pRofCu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHfnRH"&gt;The biggest thing that separates the S20 FE from the other S20 models is its materials: instead of a glass back, it has a cheaper plastic one. It still feels well-made and sturdy, though, and once you put a case on it you won’t even notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkgjI7"&gt;At its regular price of $700, the S20 FE is an excellent performing phone with a good value. But like most Samsung phones, you often can get it with a significant discount, making it an even more impressive value. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a9366L"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YEmUyn"&gt;Best small phone in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XOIazq"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is the only small phone on the market with top-tier features and specs — you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW9lbN"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s still small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to reach all of it with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8rvOC"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vYYXqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215729"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has the battery life you need to go all day long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xyIPT9"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fEqbqa"&gt;Best battery life you can get&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0OxORr"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJK8J3"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. The Note 20 Ultra is a productivity powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBHFzE"&gt;There are other phones on the market with equally as big or even bigger batteries than the Note 20 Ultra, but they aren’t as premium or feature rich and they require you to make noticeable compromises elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera you can get in a phone this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cqDZyL"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UnCwn5"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HMWyVS"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SOLCW"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Lzlez"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s iPhone SE provides the most bang for your buck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIIlAI"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sJumlJ"&gt;Best budget phone in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jUoPHA"&gt;The budget phone (under $500) that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Specifically, we recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNXHmP"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried-and-true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqRVDv"&gt;But in exchange for that very familiar phone body, you get a lot of value. The best thing about the iPhone SE is its processor, Apple’s A13 Bionic. That matters not just because of speed, but because it also means the phone will have a much longer lifetime in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n2bsbC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556638"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPHfUO"&gt;Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means that in a few years the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhPqRw"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2020 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ODEAze"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGSyayDrR2mXPWMiM9i0d_4YCk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691996/vpavic_200728_4113_0127.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s PIxel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means that the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books, to browsing the web, to watching video, to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than you’re used to. It is also delicate — there’s no rated dust or water resistance and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: at $2,000, the Fold 2 is literally twice as expensive as other high-end phones. You’re paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods Max first look: lots to prove</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max from above" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vpHqQubstLK_bgtpOF_Eff-1kao=/0x249:1000x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489888/npatel_201209_4332_0019sq.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;At $549, they need to deliver more than just good sound&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Xczc3j"&gt;I’ve been playing with Apple’s new $549 AirPods Max over-ear headphones since yesterday afternoon, and so far they sound very nice and fit very comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMlMIj"&gt;They also — I have to say this — have a distinct smell, like a funky riff on new-car smell. I am pretty sure that’s a byproduct of the memory foam earpads rolling off the manufacturing line and straight into a shipping box to my house, and I’m reliably told it will fade away over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5UCFZ"&gt;I would probably not tell you what a pair of $100 headphones smells like. But at $550, I feel compelled to note that the AirPods Max are a multisensory experience out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max headband" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-jJQLigb9MPDQnoYs35H51arBnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159216/npatel_201209_4332_0036.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2rVS8D"&gt;Design-wise, the AirPods Max are an interesting blend of classic only-Apple design flourishes and odd incongruities. The headband is stainless steel covered in white rubbery material, with a “breathable mesh knit canopy” across the top; Apple says this distributes the weight of the headphones more evenly across your head. (I can’t say it feels very much different than my Sony WH-1000XM2s, but it’s possible I just have a very large head.) The headband connects to the earcups with adjustable stainless-steel extensions culminating in a pleasantly spring-loaded hinge, all of which is nicer than any other premium headphones I’ve used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max bottom" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcDSPV8w6-QPYFuGbVVpXtYrgBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159219/npatel_201209_4332_0033.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y45TJP"&gt;The fairly large earcups are where things get a little messier. I have the silver AirPods Max, and the vast expanse of flattish aluminum does not look at first glance like $550 — it’s possible the other colors look more premium, but you would be forgiven for thinking these are plastic until you touch them and feel the coldness of metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnrWIw"&gt;The earcups are not smooth, unbroken surfaces. There are 10 slots of various shapes and sizes cut into the earcup shells. Seven of those are microphones: six used for noise-cancellation and another for voice calls. (There are another two mics inside the earcups.) These slots are not symmetrical; the top of the left earcup has one long slot, one short one, and then three more slots on the bottom along with a long gray plastic antenna line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YRqQ2T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review: taking back the crown","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"},{"title":"Sony WH-1000XM4 review: the best noise-canceling headphones get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LJh2zE"&gt;There are two slots on top of the right earcup, and there are three more on the bottom, in addition to a small status LED and the Lightning port, which Apple chose over USB-C to be more convenient for all the iPhone users out there. The AirPods Max can be charged to its full 20-hour battery life in two hours from the standard 5W iPhone brick, and run for 90 minutes after just five minutes on the charger. (There’s no fast-charging available, even if you use a USB-C to Lightning cable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max digital crown" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXA48ZX3DznrRvhOK_bRyXXMk14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159220/npatel_201209_4332_0029.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max digital crown compared to Apple Watch digital crown" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-MdApQafu_eT_aX8HAeMOhg3Fk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159327/npatel_201209_4332_0058.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmCN7U"&gt;The right earcup also has a button to switch between noise-cancelling and transparency mode, as well as a Digital Crown volume control you can press to play and pause music, and hold to invoke Siri. (You can also just say “Hey Siri,” which worked well enough.) One note on the crown: it’s much bigger than the one that appears on an Apple Watch, so it doesn’t feel too awkward to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHINMW"&gt;All of this is to say: there’s a lot going on visually with the AirPods Max, much more so than you’d expect from a pair of $550 Apple headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEs7cF"&gt;One thing you will not find: a 3.5mm or 2.5mm analog audio input, which is standard issue on noise-canceling headphones at this price point — that’s how you plug into an airplane seat-back entertainment system to watch the movie. Apple knows this is a common use case, because it is selling a $35 3.5mm-to-Lightning cable for exactly that purpose. That brings you to $585 for the AirPods Max, which is just $15 less than an entire iPhone 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEsjtRbdI_mi8xja_w72EzH2zyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159326/npatel_201209_4332_0060.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EZT5t8fkJEkWPnKf2xtfgq5ZUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159325/npatel_201209_4332_0063.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gs7QJy"&gt;The memory-foam earcups are very comfortable, and attach magnetically — they remain firmly in place, but come out easily when you need them to. Underneath, there’s white plastic, and a window for the sensor that detects your ears — the music automatically stops when you take the headphones off, or even just lift one earcup to talk to someone. The AirPods Max don’t have a power button, which is very Apple; they just go to sleep when they haven’t been on your head for a while, and then wake up when you put them back on. Clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfLJy784kh1AUCVTFVHU8pIrOkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159226/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The back of the AirPods Max case exposes where the material comes through itself and is glued in place.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwopur"&gt;I have no idea what’s going on with the AirPods Max case, which is a goofy one-piece contraption that’s folded and glued over on itself to form a case. It looks very much like a purse when wrapped around the headphones, which is at once fun and clever and also not the point of a headphones case that needs to survive in a backpack. It does not appear very protective, feels like it will get dirty fast, and generally does not hold a candle to the nice hard cases that come with almost every other set of premium headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfBRLU"&gt;It is one of the cheaper-feeling things Apple has ever made, in my estimation — the second in a trend that started with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;the MagSafe Duo Charger&lt;/a&gt;. I hope there is not a third thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdN0YCZxjqQakcK-QGhVd9SF1AY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159213/npatel_201209_4332_0043.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max case interior" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7M5FimbBvOA3OSPoBGM0Hpin6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159210/npatel_201209_4332_0047.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NT1X03"&gt;Sound-wise, I’ve had fun listening to the AirPods Max for a few hours — they’re crisp and bright, with a pleasingly wider soundstage than my Sony headphones, and no distortion at all, even at max volume. We’ll have a full review of these soon, including tests of spatial audio and Apple’s claim of Atmos surround sound support, so stay tuned for that. But for now, rest assured the AirPods Max sound more than good enough to compete with other high-end headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqKGEP"&gt;Of course, those competing headphones are all cheaper — much cheaper — than the AirPods Max. The newest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4s&lt;/a&gt; are regularly on sale for $300, sound very good, and have a 10-hour-longer battery life. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt; are $339, also sound very good, and have brand cachet that’s known in first-class cabins the world over. (They also both have audio-in jacks for those seat-back entertainment systems.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PcYNBI"&gt;Whether Apple has actually done enough here to justify the staggering premium over the competition is an open question that it’ll take us a little more time reviewing to answer. &lt;/p&gt;
