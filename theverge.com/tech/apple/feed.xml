    <title>Telegram can now import your WhatsApp chat history on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eBGFBy"&gt;Telegram has added the ability to import your chat history from WhatsApp, meaning you won’t lose past conversations if you want to switch messaging services. On iOS the feature arrived with &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807"&gt;version 7.4&lt;/a&gt;, released yesterday and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/27/amid-whatsapp-privacy-backlash-telegram-building-new-tool-for-importing-chats-from-other-apps/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the update doesn’t appear to be live yet on Android. Alongside WhatsApp, chat histories from Line and KakaoTalk can also be imported, according to Telegram’s changelog. We’ve verified that you can import chats from WhatsApp into the latest version (7.4.1) of Telegram and continue the conversation, so long as each WhatsApp user has a Telegram account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcEJby"&gt;The addition of the feature comes as Telegram is reporting huge increases in user numbers, with the service now boasting over 500 million active users worldwide. The cause appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;WhatsApp’s new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted privacy concerns about the Facebook-owned messaging app (WhatsApp later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delayed the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of the new policy, and insists it won’t affect the security of consumer chats or profile data). For users jumping ship from WhatsApp to Telegram, being able to take their chat histories with them means one fewer barrier to switching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0xoUSfoeX5T4exuoOpGR8lvO9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265199/IMG_0372.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imports work on a chat-by-chat basis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4MEQ0g"&gt;The import process works on a chat-by-chat basis, but appears to work for both individual and group conversations, at least with WhatsApp. To import a chat from Facebook’s messaging service, open the relevant conversation, and tap the group or contact name from the top of the chat to open its info screen. From there, the “Export Chat” option opens the iOS Share Sheet, where you’ll see the option to select Telegram. Then, just pick a Telegram chat to import the messages into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSOgud"&gt;Any messages imported into chats have a small “Imported” label on them noting when they were originally sent, and when they were brought into Telegram, and messages are visible to all chat participants. You have the option of importing WhatsApp chat histories with or without their images. Imported messages appear in the order in which they are imported, rather than in the order they were originally sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKgxG9"&gt;Telegram’s support for imported chat histories arrives alongside a handful of other quality of life improvements for the messaging service, like being able to adjust volumes for individual voice chat participants, or reporting “fake groups or channels” that are attempting to impersonate famous people or organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fETq7i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iOS 14 beta will begin forcing developers to ask for permission to track you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ck1xmBMqNbXEgXByF6K_VwzAzk4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732132/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aaqfdv"&gt;Apple’s new privacy feature requiring developers ask  for permission to track iOS users for ad targeting is at last going live in the next iOS 14 beta with a planned full release some time this spring for non-beta users, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87OaT5"&gt;The announcement coincides with Data Privacy Day, as well as a speech on privacy from Apple CEO Tim Cook later today at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels. Apple initially planned for the feature to go live with the launch of iOS 14 last fall, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed its implementation to 2021&lt;/a&gt; in September of last year to give developers more time to comply. Today’s announcement narrows the launch window to this spring, but Apple is not commenting further on when exactly we might see it go live for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nd7oq5"&gt;Called App Tracking Transparency, the new opt-in requirement will mark a significant shift in how mobile app developers are able to collect data on iPhone owners and share that data with other firms, including data brokers, to aid in advertising. As it stands right now, Apple lets iPhone owners dig into their settings to disable this type of tracking. Now, instead of forcing users to be proactive about disabling it, Apple will demand developers ask for permission first or risk suspension or removal from the App Store if they don’t comply or try to skirt the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QVqaP8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;App Tracking Transparency will force developers to ask for permission to track iPhone users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUxx5P"&gt;The primary way advertisers are able to, say, know when you are shopping for a new hat on one app before serving you ads for that same hat on another app is that a unique identifying code, the so-called Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), is linked to your device, collected by the first app, and shared with the second. That allows those apps to serve targeted ads and to measure whether the ad actually worked, for instance if you ended up purchasing that hat you saw in an Instagram ad by clicking an ad for the company’s online store in Google Chrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxSJD"&gt;Apple’s new opt-in requirement will make it so developers must have express consent from iOS device owners to allow their IDFA to be collected and shared across apps. App makers can still use other information you give them for the purpose of targeting advertising even if you opt not to let the app track you, but that information cannot be shared with another company for the purpose of ad tracking under Apple’s new policy. The sharing with other third-party companies is effectively what Apple refers to when it uses the word “tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHsXc9"&gt;Apple intends to strictly police any attempt to get around the opt-in requirement. For instance, it says app developers will not be allowed to disable app functionality of any kind if users say no to the opt-in, and that developers will also be barred from charging money or incentivizing users with in-app perks or giveaways to sway their decision one way or the other. Any app that tries to replace the IDFA with another identifying piece of information, like an email address, will be in violation of the opt-in requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBsYIk"&gt;Apple says the rules will also apply to its own apps, and the company already lets users disable personalized advertising the company serves within the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app using data it collects from your device. (It’s worth noting that ad personalization is not the same as ad tracking, and mobile app companies can still personalize ads so long as they can disclose that with an App Store privacy label.) Apple has no history of sharing the information it collects with other companies, either, and it makes that clear in its ad personalization toggle in the iOS settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgmZqk"&gt;This is expected to affect both the companies that run ad networks, like Facebook, and the companies paying for the ads, like the aforementioned unnamed hat seller. That’s precisely why Facebook has come out as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures, which include not only this new opt-in requirement but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;app privacy labels it launched on the App Store last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yKojm"&gt;Facebook has positioned itself as a champion of small businesses that risk getting hurt by this privacy change, and small businesses do rely on Facebook’s ad network and its powerful targeting tools to reach customers. Past privacy changes to Apple’s mobile Safari browser did also have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;legitimate negative consequences for ad-supported businesses&lt;/a&gt; like news websites. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is an ad-supported news website.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6AgPuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has emerged as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jA9whl"&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; and statements to the press, Facebook has gone a step further and cast Apple as a hypocrite trying to exempt itself from the rules it forces on other developers and as greedy for encouraging app business models that rely less on advertising and more on subscriptions, of which Apple would theoretically get a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nw5Hub"&gt;“Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on an &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;earnings call on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.” Zuckerberg added that, “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people but the moves clearly track their competitor interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOygv"&gt;Apple has consistently defended its choice as a way to give users more freedom over their privacy and refuted Facebook’s claims it intends to hold its first-party software to different standards. The showdown has emerged as one of the largest and most visible tech company feuds in recent memory, though it’s clear now Facebook has little to no leverage in the situation despite its defensiveness and public posturing. The changes are imminent, and Facebook will be forced to comply as it was with the privacy labels last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBm6te"&gt;To further hammer home its privacy philosophy, Apple has created a new online guide it’s calling “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fprivacy%2Fdocs%2FA_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F28%2F22253366%2Fapple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A Day in the Life of Your Data”&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down common ad tracking and targeting practices in the mobile app and web industries and presents statistics on the prevalence of these practices. Apple cites a study that found the average mobile app contains six trackers that share your data with other apps, and that a “large and opaque industry has been amassing increasing amounts of personal data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6M300o"&gt;“A complex ecosystem of websites, apps, social media companies, data brokers, and ad tech firms track users online and offline, harvesting their personal data. This data is pieced together, shared, aggregated, and monetized, fueling a $227 billion-a-year industry,” the guide reads. “This occurs every day, as people go about their daily lives, often without their knowledge or permission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTlXLA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says there are now over 1 billion active iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o3UqHy4EPlB9VLT0KBhjpSJFYMk=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730855/cgartenberg_201105_4276_003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PzxQHS"&gt;Apple says there are now more than 1 billion active iPhones, an enormous milestone for the company that speaks to the phones’ continued success and longevity. There are now 1.65 billion Apple devices in active use overall, Tim Cook said during Apple’s earnings call this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laKAjl"&gt;The milestone had been approaching for a while. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12302542/apple-billion-iphones-sold"&gt;sold its billionth iPhone&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, and in January 2019, Apple said that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18202736/apple-devices-ios-earnings-q1-2019"&gt;hit 900 million active iPhone users&lt;/a&gt;. Apple counts a device as active if it has engaged with an Apple service within the past 90 days, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The stat would suggest that a substantial number of the iPhones ever sold remain in active use, at least by Apple’s definition. &lt;a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-nears-two-billionth-iphone-sale-13-years-after-launch-1.1371339"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BNN Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt; that analysts believed Apple would be approaching its 1.9 billionth iPhone sale by the end of 2020, though the company hasn’t announced if it’s passed that milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzIfJ6"&gt;Apple’s announcement came during an enormous quarter for the company, in which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;set an all-time revenue record&lt;/a&gt;. iPhones did particularly well during the final quarter of 2020, with sales of $65 billion, another record (though one that was helped by delays pushing iPhone 12 sales fully into the holiday quarter). And the company saw more iPhone “upgraders” than ever before. Cook also said that a record-setting number of FaceTime calls were made on Christmas 2020 — a milestone that was certainly helped along by the pandemic keeping many families and friends apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECdPrQ"&gt;While sales are up and usage is at an all-time high, Apple has spent the last several years trying to diversify its product line as iPhone unit sales slow. Analysts have estimated a decline in &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1849696/apples-drop-in-iphone-sales-are-part-of-a-global-demand-shock/"&gt;overall phone shipments&lt;/a&gt; and sales in recent years, and &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-an-interesting-chart-iphone-unit-sales-have-been-declining-steadily-for-five-years/"&gt;Apple hasn’t been immune&lt;/a&gt; to the trend. But even if fewer iPhones are being put into people’s hands each year, people are evidently hanging on to them for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59gy9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 27th, 7:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with details on how Apple measures active devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple surpasses $100 billion in quarterly revenue for first time in its history</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12, in blue." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F634QkTeHFCJIerV0S_RzB_RlYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730336/vpavic_4243_20201018_0121.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IRJ132"&gt;Apple today reported its fiscal Q1 2021 earnings, which cover the final calendar quarter of 2020 and the holiday sales season. That means this is the first time we’re getting a real indication of how the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; are faring with consumers. As it turns out, they’re doing very well. Apple crossed $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the company’s history: it brought in $111.4 billion in total, with earnings per share of $1.68. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfT7Kw"&gt;The latest iPhones went on sale a bit later than normal, and Apple has had to again close some of its retail locations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But despite those obstacles, the iPhone business did extraordinarily well, tallying over $65 billion in revenue. The previous all-time record for iPhone revenue in a quarter was $61.58 billion, which Apple hit in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SBoIW"&gt;Alongside a tweaked, flatter design, the iPhone 12 series is the first to include 5G mobile data, which some have speculated could result in a so-called “super cycle” of upgrades from people who are still using iPhones that are a couple years old at this point. The strong early interest is certainly there; now we’ll have to see if it holds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l89BnE"&gt;Apple’s Mac and iPad lines have seen rocketing sales during the prolonged period of working at home and remote education as a result of the pandemic. The momentum continued in this latest quarter, with iPad sales up a staggering 41 percent — during a holiday quarter, remember — and Mac sales up 21 percent year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uU0ZELodKHp9OMSCN3xNlwzpPww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21975638/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPad sales were up a staggering 41 percent year over year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AMFjtu"&gt;The company’s MacBook Air, base-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini are now powered by its own M1 processors. Those three products officially kicked off a transition away from Intel chips that will extend to Apple’s other Mac products over the coming months. The popular iPad Air was also updated in the fall with a more modern design similar to the iPad Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AozzPR"&gt;During an earnings call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said Apple crossed 1.65 billion active devices worldwide during the quarter. iPhones account for over 1 billion of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwYsfe"&gt;Unsurprisingly, AirPods / AirPods Pro and the Apple Watch were a holiday hit for another year running, boosting the wearables division up 30 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMrAuy"&gt;Just as 2020 came to a close, Apple launched its latest paid subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174574/apple-fitness-plus-watch-iphone-release-date-price"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which joins Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, and Apple News Plus as ways of getting recurring profits from consumers who buy Apple hardware. The company has continued to extend the trial periods for some of those services — namely, Apple TV Plus — but the services unit as a whole continues to perform very well and was up 24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoLcF"&gt;Executive shifts at the company also continue. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249393/apple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new"&gt;Just this week, Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that longtime hardware engineering SVP Dan Riccio will now focus on a new, unspecified project; John Ternus — who has publicly introduced well-received products like the revamped Mac Pro, iPad Pro, and M1 Macs — has replaced him as Apple’s hardware boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZjbN2"&gt;The company has also pushed forward with its social initiatives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228580/apple-detroit-developer-academy-equity-center-hbcu-tech-hub"&gt;announcing a number of racial equity investments&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;removed conservative social media app Parler&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store, citing insufficient moderation policies and calls to violence from some users on the app.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="Image of the iCloud for Windows screen, with the new Passwords option" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-nIWteYCLVk6VBGmLagEqcjXcU=/0x16:732x504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729981/IMAGE_2021_01_27_11_57_45.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gUsvQp"&gt;Users caught between Apple and Microsoft may now have an easier time managing passwords: it looks like iCloud Keychain is coming to Windows 10 as a Chrome extension (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/icloud-windows-chrome-extension-icloud-passwords"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It’s already in the iCloud for Windows 10 app, but there’s just one small problem: the Chrome Extension isn’t available yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSTGnx"&gt;The latest version of iCloud for Windows 10 includes “Support for iCloud Passwords Chrome Extension” in the list of new features, and when you open the app, there’s a new Passwords-syncing option. Checking the box will cause a login prompt to come up, along with a request for two-factor authentication. According to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201391"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need to have two-factor turned on for your account to have access to the feature, which is probably a good choice since, in theory, you’re going to be syncing all of your passwords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gTH8R"&gt;I say “in theory” because after you log in again, you’re prompted to download the iCloud Passwords extension for Chrome. However, the download button just takes you to a 404 page, and searching the Chrome Web Store for the extension doesn’t turn up anything. It seems like Apple may have launched the iCloud for Windows update a little prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows dialog box informing the user that they have to download the iCloud Passwords extension" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BMA4uLh9mA_9pJ19FkITpZYUm2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263750/2021_01_27_11_24_39_iCloud.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Google 404 page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cub8Mt4bQ5UiDkS2QUy4DPaJXyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263749/2021_01_27_11_29_56_Error_404__Not_Found___1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not the extension I was promised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IVMwWE"&gt;Hopefully the Chrome extension will be available soon, as having access to iCloud Keychain on Windows would make life a lot easier for people who use it on their iPhones, iPads, or Macs. However, if you simply can’t wait, you could always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to"&gt;switch to a dedicated password manager&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, moving all of your passwords would be a pain if you’re already using iCloud Keychain, so you may be better off just waiting a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly set to mass-produce iPads outside China for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air has the same design and shape as the 11-inch iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-mG4Gqfj0mgvSL3FDZ1f4Jlh5ps=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728363/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdXg9Z"&gt;Apple could start manufacturing iPads in Vietnam by the middle of this year, marking the first time a “significant number” of the tablets would be produced outside of China, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Apple-ramps-up-iPhone-and-iPad-output-shift-to-India-and-Vietnam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. As well as shifting iPad production, Apple is also reportedly increasing the number of iPhones manufactured in India, where it’s produced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/25/21338436/apple-iphone11-india-foxconn-china"&gt;some iPhone 11 units since last year&lt;/a&gt;. It will reportedly begin producing iPhone 12 series devices in the country as early as this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmOQ39"&gt;The report paints a picture of a company that’s increasingly keen to diversify its manufacturing out of China, despite hopes that trade tensions could ease under President Biden. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; notes that the new administration has said it won’t immediately ease tariffs on Chinese imports, and there are also other factors like rising labor costs in China prompting Apple and other companies to look for alternative manufacturing hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QOARp4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More audio products could be produced in Vietnam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2I76A"&gt;Beyond iPhones and iPads, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports that Apple is ramping up manufacturing of a host of other devices outside of China. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266574/apple-airpods-pro-vietnam-china-chinese-manufacturing"&gt;reports last year&lt;/a&gt; that Apple moved some AirPods Pro manufacturing to Vietnam, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says it’s also planning on expanding HomePod mini production in the country and will also move some MacBook production. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721353/apple-ipad-macbook-foxconn-manufacturing-vietnam-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported on Apple’s early plans&lt;/a&gt; to shift MacBook and iPad production to Vietnam last year.) Some Mac mini production has also been moved to Malaysia, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3rXzF"&gt;News of Apple’s shifting supply chains comes a little under two years after reports emerged that Apple was planning to move between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691132/apple-china-manufacturing-diversify-india-vietnam-trade-war-tariffs"&gt;15 and 30 percent of its manufacturing out of China&lt;/a&gt;. It now appears much of that shift is well underway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new iPhone update fixes security bugs, so it’s best to install it ASAP</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmkq7k"&gt;Apple just released iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146"&gt;the update notes&lt;/a&gt; contain some worrying language (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Under kernel updates, Apple notes that “a malicious application may be able to elevate privileges,” and under WebKit updates, it says “a remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution.” After both statements, the update notes say, “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCPp57"&gt;What this means, broadly, is that you should update your iOS devices as soon as possible. To put the language into plain terms: Apple found a security hole in its operating systems, and it also has evidence that someone may have exploited it. The update notes don’t have any further details, so for now, we don’t know who may have used the security breach or what they may have been using it for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X02zGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not time for cyber-lockdown, but it is time to update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWXa7u"&gt;However it was used, the security breaches aren’t minor ones. An application being able to elevate privileges means that it could do things it’s not supposed to be able to do. Again, there aren’t any details, but broadly speaking, it means a malicious app could’ve bypassed some of Apple’s security protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RlwXb"&gt;The WebKit exploit isn’t better. A remote attacker being able to cause arbitrary code execution means an attacker could do things on your phone just from you visiting a website they control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nFOBQ"&gt;This isn’t to say it’s time to go into total cyber-lockdown mode, but it does mean that 14.4 isn’t an update you want to put off for a while. In the meantime, Apple says it’ll provide additional details soon, so we’ll keep an eye out for more information about the exploits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tweetbot 6 brings essential updates and a monthly subscription to the iPhone’s best Twitter app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqMbUIokFDhxVQu7cRbqDIasj7I=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724797/tweetbot.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PiOYrW"&gt;Tweetbot has long been one of the best third-party Twitter applications around for the iPhone and Mac, and today sees the launch of the latest version for iOS: &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834"&gt;Tweetbot 6&lt;/a&gt;, which converts the app into a paid subscription service instead of the single-time purchase that was previously offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul7"&gt;The new app makes the change to &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access"&gt;Twitter’s new API&lt;/a&gt; that the company introduced last summer, enabling some long-missing features in the premium Twitter app like Twitter cards and polls. That change does come with some trade-offs, though, including the removal of user-selected options for URL shortening, image uploads, and video uploads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0OcxaY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter launches new API as it tries to make amends with third-party developers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Rb0hGa"&gt;The free version of the app offers some basic functionality in allowing users to view Twitter — but you’ll have to pay for more substantial features, including the ability to send or reply to tweets, along with support for multiple accounts, push notifications, and “advanced filtering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgwxoH"&gt;Existing users may find the update to be a bit frustrating, given that Tweetbot 5 had previously been a single-time purchase for $4.99. At $0.99 per month (or a discounted $5.99 per year), the new app marks a price increase no matter how you look at things, while offering only a handful of new features to make up the difference. Furthermore, Tapbots will soon stop selling Tweetbot 5 on the App Store (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992"&gt;developer Paul Haddad&lt;/a&gt; says Apple made that a requirement to approve the new version), so new users soon won’t have the choice to buy the outdated older version for a single-time payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbLEJq"&gt;Tapbots does note on its website that the new version of Tweetbot 6 is an “early access” version of the app, with “many new features on our roadmap to be built as well as new API’s to adopt as Twitter makes them available,” so it’s possible that the new app will get further functionality over time that may ease the bitter pill of the pricer subscription change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRmNnI"&gt;The company also has yet to announce any upgrade plans for the Mac version of Tweetbot, which currently uses the older Twitter API and still costs $9.99 upfront to use. Including an updated macOS version of Tweetbot in that monthly or yearly subscription could also help add value to the new subscription, a strategy that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21109700/fantastical-flexibits-subscription-service-premium-price-apple"&gt;other apps like Fantastical&lt;/a&gt; have employed in their own jumps from paid apps to ongoing subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The HomePod mini finally adds its long-promised ultra-wideband handoff feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KUkQeNCTORVzfKiKt_ZCG5ck70=/0x70:2400x1670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723965/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gYySHV"&gt;Apple has officially released iOS 14.4 and a matching update for its HomePod mini speaker, adding the long-promised ultra-wideband (UWB) handoff feature that will allow newer iPhones to more seamlessly transfer music, calls, and podcasts between the two devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2eY2ea"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple HomePod mini review: playing small ball","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A5Dljp"&gt;While both the original HomePod and the HomePod mini have supported handing off music for some time, the smaller device features a U1 ultra-wideband chip that promises to make it even easier to transfer content over from an iPhone 12 or iPhone 11 device. The new U1-enhanced functionality also adds additional features, including new visual and haptic feedback. The U1-based system also will give the option to show listening suggestions when you bring your phone close and display media controls on your iPhone without requiring you to unlock it first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcqyfR"&gt;The ultra-wideband handoff feature was originally showcased when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21432979/apple-homepod-mini-features-specs-price"&gt;HomePod mini was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t included with the original release. Instead, Apple promised that it would be available later in 2020 (a deadline that the company has slightly missed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvIuOt"&gt;To take advantage of the new update, you’ll need a HomePod mini that’s been updated to the latest software, along with a U1-equipped iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 device that’s running iOS 14.4. The original HomePod isn’t compatible with the new functionality, though, due to its lack of a U1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple execs discussed not ‘leaving money on the table’ when setting Apple TV subscription fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTVeQlKKKGmZdfkAYAHilJNHgk0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722856/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KBQY4h"&gt;In Apple and Epic’s ongoing court battle over App Store fees, one of the key sticking points has been Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21531873/epic-apple-fortnite-app-store-lawsuit"&gt;insistence on maintaining a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; as a cornerstone of the storefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkC3mF"&gt;But newly revealed &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20464232-apple-exhibit-b"&gt;Apple executive emails from the case&lt;/a&gt; show that the App Store rules that Apple flouts as essential to the fairness of the app economy were carefully negotiated into existence over time in a way that ensured Apple wasn’t “leaving money on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4w4jse"&gt;The emails date back to a 2011 discussion, which included Apple software and services leader Eddy Cue, around how Apple would handle subscription video applications on the Apple TV — an important conversation, given the rise in popularity of streaming services. And while the discussion doesn’t offer much insight on Apple’s existing 30 percent fee for the App Store, it does reveal how malleable those rules were when it came to maximizing profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRP3wH"&gt;The company examined a variety of options, including a 40 percent one-time cut, a 30 percent one-time cut, a 30 percent ongoing fee, or more individualized deals with services like the NBA and MLB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX3yid"&gt;One email in the thread breaks down the different forms of content partners that would be offering subscriptions on Apple TV. It muses on which partnerships would be fruitful to try to get a cut (like new streaming services) and which ones won’t (like “entrenched” cable and satellite companies).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHle-AJR8b0RE6LKcGd2N6UC2lk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260627/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.07.36_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lDBfdE"&gt;Apple’s team settled on the idea that any iTunes-based transactions or subscriptions should stick with the same 30 percent cut as the App Store. But there’s more discussion over how the company will handle referrals, where the Apple TV applications link out to a service’s website for customers to subscribe directly to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xM9m6i_UWcZYgJgw3MB4OnVDiMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260629/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.08.32_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J6Yb07"&gt;The thread then discusses how fees should work when Apple refers a new subscriber. Should the company insist on 30 percent of the initial subscription? 30 percent of the first year? Just insist that all subscription applications funnel subscribers through the App Store? Concerns are raised that Hulu Plus might not be able to afford that kind of cost. Cue responds that Apple should ask for 40 percent of the first year, but that it may need to work out a few deals first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdnLiY"&gt;One point of concern for Apple was structuring the new fees in such a way that they didn’t undermine the payment structure it set on the App Store. “I don’t want to do any deals where we get less than 30%. That is what it is on the app store and we can’t be making a different deal here. If that is not possible than I want a one-time bounty but we need to very careful here so this doesn’t spillover to the app store,” one exec wrote. (The emails are threaded such that it’s hard to tell who is replying to whom.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Cw0ALFI1PdfQ_VGLmANjLY2Jqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260628/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.08.01_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0jAV1"&gt;It’s important to remember that in 2011, the Apple TV didn’t actually have an App Store — just individual apps that Apple worked out partnerships with on a case-by-case basis. And the thread seems to emphasize the ad hoc nature of the platform development here: Apple doesn’t seem to come into this with any defined ideas of what it needs to make the platform succeed, just a vague goal of maximizing profit and shaping the rules for the platform to best achieve that. &lt;/p&gt;
