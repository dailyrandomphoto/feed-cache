    <title>Facebook reportedly hit with campaign by pro-Palestine activists leaving 1-star app store ratings</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iny5gO"&gt;A social media campaign by pro-Palestine activists has pushed down the ranking for Facebook’s app in Apple and Google’s app stores, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The activists are seeking to protest Facebook’s alleged censorship of Palestinian accounts on its platform, and are instructing people to leave Facebook’s app a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Skkyy__/status/1394588317900025858"&gt;one-star review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50MaNh"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NBC New&lt;/em&gt;s, Facebook is treating the situation as a high-priority issue internally; one software engineer wrote in a post on an internal Facebook message board that “users are upset with our handling of the situation,” adding that the users “have started protesting by leaving 1-star reviews.”  Facebook has reached out to have the reviews removed, but so far, Apple has declined the request to remove the reviews. It’s not clear how or if Google responded to the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRbdQF"&gt;The rating for Facebook’s iOS app on the App Store as of Sunday afternoon was 2.3 stars out of 5, with 1-star ratings far outpacing others. In the Google Play store the situation was similar; the Android Facebook app had a slightly higher 2.4 rating, with the majority of the reviews 1-star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvjnPi"&gt;Apple and Google did not immediately reply to requests for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4ezoe"&gt;Facebook did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but a spokesperson said in a statement to&lt;em&gt; NBC&lt;/em&gt; that the company does not censor it users, but applies its policies equally “regardless of who is posting or their personal beliefs.” The spokesperson added that the company has a dedicated team that includes Arabic and Hebrew speakers who are “closely monitoring the situation on the ground, who are focused on making sure we’re removing harmful content, while addressing any enforcement errors as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrUndz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvXQbz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after future update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOtKaw-P1xfh2CUMir5x-DtzEic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328285/jbareham_180202_2266_0042.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sD5nPS"&gt;In a new support document on its website, Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183"&gt;dives a little deeper into the details&lt;/a&gt; around the upcoming launch of lossless audio on Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxkEOt"&gt;Apple now says that both the HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after a future software update. That’ll be good news to people who’ve invested in one or a pair of Apple’s smart speakers. Two HomePods grouped in stereo playing a lossless source? Yeah, that’s going to sound wonderful. Apple isn’t yet giving any timetable for when this software update will be released, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIusvP"&gt;The document also clarifies that the Apple TV 4K will only support standard lossless audio when the ALAC files become available in June. Apple has said that in most cases, the “Hi-Res Lossless” tier will require external devices like a USB DAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSkBY0"&gt;Apple uses the document to tout its “commitment” to providing customers with the best possible listening experience. It talks up both AAC — claiming that the format has become “virtually indistinguishable from the original studio recording” as encoding methods have evolved — and its Apple Digital Masters initiative. I continue to think that Apple is much more excited about spatial audio and Dolby Atmos mixes coming to Apple Music than anything to do with lossless itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8J91M"&gt;The document also reiterates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;what Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; in regards to the AirPods Max: when listening to audio via the Lightning-to-3.5mm cable, the company says it’ll sound fantastic, but it won’t technically be “lossless” due to an analog to digital conversion that occurs in the cable. Apple again confirms that lossless quality will be exclusive to Apple Music:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YM2kOC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I redownload my iTunes purchases in lossless?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gM7OrM"&gt;If you subscribe to Apple Music, you can redownload music in lossless only from the Apple Music catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vYKo36"&gt;The straightforward answer to the question as written is really a flat “no,” but obviously Apple wants to nudge people towards its subscription service. Apple Music will offer over 20 million songs in lossless quality at launch in June, and that total will reach over 75 million by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook’s Fortnite trial testimony was unexpectedly revealing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlLa-l7Gi7acAzhS7HlzqN7CSsE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328196/1233030839.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkoY2d"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial was bookended by Tims. Epic Games called its CEO Tim Sweeney as the first witness nearly three weeks ago. Yesterday, Apple called Tim Cook as the last to take the stand, before both sides make their final case to a judge on Monday. Cook was supposed to bring home Apple’s defense of its ecosystem. He did it by laying out Apple’s most high-minded principles — but also its hard financial calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGpgYJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; covers two separate issues: whether the market for in-app purchases within the App Store is unfairly monopolistic, and whether iOS &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is a monopoly that should be opened up to third-party stores and side-loaded apps. Cook addressed both with an appeal to user safety and privacy. “Privacy from our point of view is one of the most important issues of the century, and safety and security are the foundation that privacy is built upon,” he explained to an Apple attorney, echoing countless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446220/apple-privacy-ad-video-ad-tracking-transparency"&gt;iPhone ad campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. “Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data from people, and we like to provide people tools to circumvent that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="0VthQ1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qhsVpC"&gt;Supporting side-loaded apps would remake iOS, and it’s much easier for Cook and Apple to outline the potential downsides. Giving users control creates risk, and Cook argued that people choose iOS specifically so they won’t have to make risky decisions with sensitive data. “We’re trying to give the customer an integrated solution of hardware, software, and services,” he said. “I just don’t think you replicate that in a third party.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNnDYU"&gt;Epic mustered its own arguments: people can still choose to keep their phones locked down, and they might want to access stores with even more carefully curated apps or even better privacy controls. It’s previously accused Apple of hypocrisy, pointing out anecdotal failures to catch specific apps (like a game called &lt;em&gt;Ganja Farmer: Weed Empire&lt;/em&gt;) that violate App Store guidelines. “It’s not 100 percent. It’s not perfect. You will find mistakes being made,” Cook said when Apple’s counsel asked about those incidents. “But if you back up and look at it in the scheme of things, with 1.8 million or so apps on the store, we do a really good job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3WXYt"&gt;Luckily for Apple, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers hasn’t demonstrated much interest in completely opening up iOS. She’s asked a steady trickle of questions about in-app purchases, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;anti-steering provisions&lt;/a&gt;, and the structure of individual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;apps like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but rarely about third-party app distribution or sideloading. (One of those rare incidents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;seemed critical&lt;/a&gt; of Epic, too.) While Rogers’ questions don’t necessarily indicate how she’ll rule, there’s a fairly conspicuous lack of requests for more detail or clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h78mEu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“IAP helps Apple efficiently collect a commission”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azAogS"&gt;But losing mandatory in-app purchase commissions would still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21369460/apple-fortnite-app-store-services-business-model-epic-games"&gt;be a big blow&lt;/a&gt; for Apple. Cook used more privacy and safety claims to defend that system, saying it would be both insecure and inconvenient to let apps process payments separately. He was also, however, a little blunter about Apple’s own interests. “IAP helps Apple efficiently collect a commission” — for payment processing, but also customer service and the use of Apple’s intellectual property. Without in-app purchases, “we would have to come up with another system to invoice developers, which I think would be a mess.” If Apple let developers tell users about other payment methods, Cook said later, “we would in essence give up our total return on our IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUlxWp"&gt;Apple called an expert yesterday to describe how its multibillion-dollar research and development costs help developers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/21/6746613/first-games-ios-8-metal-graphics-available-download"&gt;through APIs like Metal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15725994/apple-mobile-ai-chip-announced-wwdc-2017"&gt;CoreML&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not necessarily sinister for Apple to profit from these investments. But unlike better privacy and safety features, higher profit margins don’t directly improve consumer welfare, the key standard in antitrust trials. Judge Rogers ended Cook’s testimony with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;some of her most interesting questions yet&lt;/a&gt;, grilling Cook on whether in-app game purchases — like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; V-Bucks and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; gold — were effectively subsidizing the rest of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cicn8i"&gt;Rogers doesn’t seem to personally &lt;em&gt;like &lt;/em&gt;video game microtransactions; she’s mused multiple times about potentially predatory impulse buys. But it matters that she singled out games. Epic has pushed to make this suit cover all App Store purchases, while Apple has been trying to limit it to digital video game sales. (That’s why witnesses spent so much time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;trying to define a game&lt;/a&gt;.) Cook’s interrogation suggested that even if iOS stays intact and “gamers” are the only audience in question, Apple still has battles left to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vox Media’s Eric Arredondo on working as IT support </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7k5orjsovbwa93KfYhmNRG8TLQI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69327773/bfarsace_200407_3962_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2g3kM5"&gt;It’s safe to say that no company in existence today that has more than a couple of employees can exist without a knowledgeable IT support person or team. When you’re trying to run a website, create a solid technological structure, and keep things running even at the most stressful of times, a strong IT support team can make sure that things don’t go completely haywire at the worst time — or, if it does, that somebody is there to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1VUdX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is certainly no different, and so we asked one of the members of Vox Media’s IT team — Eric Arredondo, IT administrator — to tell us a bit about himself and his job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="us5hNN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10508485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qsKelo"&gt;What do you do for Vox Media?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cgVAW7"&gt;I am an IT administrator for our IT service desk team. I help manage and support the internal systems, applications, and hardware that keep the company operating. My team’s responsibilities cover a wide range of needs to support our various networks and departments, ranging from hardware asset management like the company computers to employee account creation or email support. Essentially, our work is to help everyone do their best work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="D9ira7"&gt;How has your job changed during the pandemic?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1QUdA1"&gt;Our general mission has remained the same, for the most part, but supporting our company entirely remotely has brought up new challenges. We definitely ship a lot more than ever, supporting our company’s current work-from-home environment and trying our best to give the same level of service as we would in the office. We try to help supply any equipment necessary for users to get their work done and emulate the office experience at home as best as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaxvAb"&gt;Interestingly enough, it’s sometimes the small things that used to take a few minutes to do in person that have proven to be the most challenging. For example, in the old times, I could just walk over to a user’s desk and assist right away, whereas now it’s much more hands-off, talking a user through troubleshooting over Slack or Zoom. Additionally, in the office, we can control the network that the team connects to and utilizes — it’s easier than dealing with each user’s own respective ISPs and router issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbjLwc"&gt;We’ve always been a pretty remote-friendly company, though, which helped my team with the transition to fully remote work. It’s definitely made us more efficient than ever, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KENpFn"&gt;What hardware tools do you and your colleagues use? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z9a8j"&gt;Generally, everything we need to do can be done via our computers, with most of our admin work being done via software or SAAS (software as a service) apps. I work on an &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeEricArrendoIT052121" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, and while I have a desk with a monitor and such, I’ll generally work all over my apartment, sometimes from the backyard. I do have a loud mechanical keyboard, a &lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;Keychron K2&lt;/a&gt;, that sits at my desk with fun lights and a lot of key travel. It’s something I probably wouldn’t have put my office neighbors through, but at home, I’ll happily type on a loud, clicky keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yyQ8iK"&gt;
&lt;div id="BTAq9c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10334147"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ayQuqT"&gt;
&lt;p id="4yshO3"&gt;I also use an &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJ2R2LL%2FA%2Fmagic-trackpad-2-silver&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeEricArrendoIT052121" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Magic Trackpad 2&lt;/a&gt;, as I prefer it to an external mouse, and use a &lt;a href="https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand360.html"&gt;Rain Design mStand360&lt;/a&gt; to prop up my computer at my desk. I could probably do with a more supportive desk chair, but I sit in a Supreme director’s chair in my WFH office, mostly because I like how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B73LZs"&gt;My label printer, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DYMO-LabelWriter-Thermal-Printer-1755120/dp/B002M1LGJ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dymo LabelWriter 4XL&lt;/a&gt;, has also been getting a lot of use during the pandemic, in regards to the aforementioned shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Xzbt6x"&gt;
&lt;div id="c4CjWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10508786"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="aSKUdf"&gt;
&lt;p id="1dSQZ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What software tools do you and your colleagues use? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zIiFd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; is probably the obvious one, along with Gmail and other Google Workspace services. Aside from using those tools ourselves, we also serve as admins in those environments with elevated management permissions, providing support and guidance to the various users and teams who use them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He1ikY"&gt;We use &lt;a href="https://www.zendesk.com/"&gt;Zendesk&lt;/a&gt; as our ticketing service, using it to manage all the various requests we get from across the company. Another tool we utilize is &lt;a href="https://www.jamf.com/"&gt;JAMF&lt;/a&gt;, a hardware management tool we have installed on all company computers, and that is useful for widespread asset management, pushing out software and policies, as well as installing our various security tools remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6pSC2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If someone wanted to get into IT, how would you suggest they go about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOXEZ3"&gt;I got my training, experience, and certifications originally from my retail work. But there are a lot of online resources that can help you get an idea of what modern companies expect from a technology perspective, and what skills can be developed, such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itpro.tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22444109%2Fit-support-slack-macbook-keychron-zendesk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ITPro.tv&lt;/a&gt;, an online learning center for IT standards and certifications, as well as tutorial videos on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lynda.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22444109%2Fit-support-slack-macbook-keychron-zendesk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lynda (now called LinkedIn Learning)&lt;/a&gt; or even Youtube for specific applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NCVSs"&gt;The job is pretty evenly split between technical knowledge and customer service, so you also have to be really good at talking to people, being able to support and guide with both empathy and confidence. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0Qos8"&gt;We have poked a &lt;em&gt;considerable&lt;/em&gt; amount of fun at the Apple TV’s Siri Remote over the years, and we’re pleased to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;it’s finally fixed&lt;/a&gt; — except for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/5/10/22429238/apple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design"&gt;the headsmacking decision &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;to stick the company’s AirTag UWB locator technology&lt;/a&gt; into one of the few gadgets absolutely, positively guaranteed to get lost in your couch cushions someday. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlPSKR"&gt;Today, Apple VP Tim Twerdahl &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/05/21/apple-vp-tim-twerdahl-talks-apple-tv-2021-gaming-future/"&gt;answered that burning question&lt;/a&gt; in perhaps the most unsatisfactory way imaginable: simply, that the new TV remote’s thick enough you shouldn’t need to worry about that much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMTTIH"&gt;Here’s the whole exchange &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/05/21/apple-vp-tim-twerdahl-talks-apple-tv-2021-gaming-future/"&gt;between Twerdahl and &lt;em&gt;MobileSyrup’s &lt;/em&gt;Patrick O’Rourke&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="38EvNI"&gt;Q: Was there ever any thought to adding some sort of AirTag-like technology in the Siri remote? I’m always losing the remote in my couch cushions and it seems like it would be a great idea. Did Apple not bother because the ‘Find My’ network is more designed for use outside of the home? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l66XrV"&gt;Twerdahl: We are super excited about AirTags and what we’re doing with U1, and part of that power is the Find My network and the fact that we can leverage a billion devices around the world to help you find stuff. To your point, that is the most powerful out of the home. With the changes we’ve made to the Siri Remote — including making it a bit thicker so it won’t fall in your couch cushions as much — that need to have all these other network devices find it seems a little bit lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JXgDT3"&gt;I would have perhaps bought “we tried it and it drained the battery too quickly” or “we finalized the Siri Remote before AirTags were ready” or even “it cost too much to hit our target price.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ml2s0N"&gt;But thickness? My Roku remotes got swallowed by my couch cushions &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt;, and those thick suckers had AA batteries and full-size headphone jacks inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CMm1d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch says&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s right about one thing, though — compared to the original Siri Remote’s thinness, it’s an improvement where couches are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook faces harsh questions about the App Store from judge in Fortnite trial</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="78jNcW"&gt;Apple called CEO Tim Cook to conclude three weeks of testimony in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple — &lt;/em&gt;and with the end of the trial approaching, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers engaged Cook in a surprisingly tense exchange over Apple’s business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eenHBa"&gt;Rogers noted that most of Apple’s App Store revenue comes from games, and she asked Cook why developers can’t use other payment methods to sell in-app purchases, or at least tell users they can make those transactions elsewhere. “If they wanted to go and get a cheaper Battle Pass or V-Bucks, and they don’t know they’ve got that option, what is the problem with Apple giving them that option?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ghs6I"&gt;“If we allowed people to link out like that, we would in essence give up our total return on our [intellectual property],” Cook said bluntly. Apple has talked repeatedly about the work it puts into maintaining the App Store and the iOS platform, and it’s accused companies like Epic of wanting a free ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8dhc5"&gt;Rogers made the opposite case. “The gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it’s almost as if they’re subsidizing everybody else,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="me8v4C"&gt;Cook countered that Apple’s many free apps attracted a larger audience than developers could get on their own. “We need a return on our IP. We have 150,000 APIs that we create and maintain, and numerous developer tools, and the customer service piece of dealing with all these transactions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3pdOXx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re charging the gamers to subsidize Wells Fargo.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FTwpJQ"&gt;But Rogers didn’t sound convinced. She asked why Apple wouldn’t take a cut of something like a banking app transaction: “You don’t charge Wells Fargo, right? Or Bank of America? But you’re charging the gamers to subsidize Wells Fargo.” When Cook said it was because Apple specifically charged for digital goods sales, Rogers noted that Apple itself had defined that rule — saying it was a deliberate choice of business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuVPpw"&gt;“I understand this notion that somehow Apple’s bringing the customers to the users. But after that first time, after that first interaction, the [developers] are keeping the customer with the games. Apple’s just profiting off that, it seems to me,” Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="welc1v"&gt;She also said it didn’t sound like Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;recent App Store price drops&lt;/a&gt; were motivated by competition — just fear of regulation and lawsuits. “The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition,” said Rogers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dx3UEN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cook says Apple’s commission covers tech, customer service, and a giant user base&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4yodJ6"&gt;Cook replied that after Apple had lowered some commissions to 15 percent, Google did the same, indicating that there was competition, but the judge was dismissive of this argument. “I understand perhaps that [was the issue] when Google changed its price, but your action wasn’t the result of competition,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrBGnO"&gt;The heart of the issue, for Rogers, seems to be a survey that indicates 39 percent of developers were “somewhat” or “very” dissatisfied with Apple’s distribution services. “How is that acceptable, and how is it — assuming those numbers are true — how is it that you’re feeling any motivation and incentive to address their needs?” she asked Cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8kR4H"&gt;Cook said that sometimes, developers’ and users’ needs conflict — and Cook emphasized in his earlier testimony that Apple puts users first. But he acknowledged that he didn’t regularly get surveys on developer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70gzES"&gt;We won’t know the verdict of &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; for weeks or months, and there’s one day of arguments left in court. The exchange with Cook doesn’t necessarily tell us how Rogers will eventually rule, and it certainly doesn’t mean Epic will get some of its bigger demands met. It does suggest, however, that Rogers is seriously considering Epic’s argument that Apple has too much control over one specific part of iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYF5bM"&gt;You can find the full exchange between Rogers and Cook below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bCJKd2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;At the beginning of your testimony, you indicated that you wanted to focus on users. I’ve seen evidence that a significant portion of revenue from in-app purchases comes from gamers. Have you seen evidence to that effect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udVoFP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I have, your honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8dSZi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;And it’s incredibly significant — compared to all other users, revenue is coming from gamers more than anyone else, am I right in my current understanding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdYBsZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;The majority of the revenue on the App Store comes from games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PI8oVX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;And in-app purchases in particular, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="766va2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wao55I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;The other thing you said is that you want to give users control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juPrX9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Right. For their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xskhWD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;So what is the problem with allowing users to have choice, especially in a gaming context, to have a cheaper option for content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unMSkU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I think they have a choice today. They have a choice between many different Android models of smartphone or an iPhone, and that iPhone has a certain set of principles behind it, from safety and security to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4y6hk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But if they wanted to go and get a cheaper Battle Pass or V-Bucks, and they don’t know they’ve got that option, what is the problem with Apple giving them that option? Or at least the information that they can go and have a different option for making purchases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIQXzH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;If we allowed people to link out like that, we would in essence give up our total return on our IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whMFY9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But you could also monetize it a different way, couldn’t you? I mean, that is, the gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it’s almost as if they’re subsidizing everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLxXaM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;The bulk of the apps on the App Store are free, so you’re right that there is some sort of subsidy there. However, the way I look at that, Your Honor, is that by having such a large number of apps that are free on the store, it increases the traffic to the store dramatically, so the benefit somebody gets is a much higher audience to sell to than they would otherwise if there weren’t free apps there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGPu0l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;So your logic then is that it’s more of a customer base, not an IP, then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XOPK7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s both, because we need a return on our IP. We have 150,000 APIs that we create and maintain, and numerous developer tools, and the customer service piece of dealing with all these transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcii3J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But let me ask you, so banking apps. I have multiple banking apps, I haven’t paid for them, but I suspect other than the $99, you don’t charge Wells Fargo, right? Or Bank of America? But you’re charging the gamers to subsidize Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cvuTc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;In the gamers example, they’re transacting on our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02eamZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;People are doing lots of things on your platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZI2HM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;But this is a digital transaction with an observable change in currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xr423"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s just a choice of a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni40Ij"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve made a choice. There are clearly other ways to monetize, but we chose this one, because we think this one overall is the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1Zfxs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, it’s quite lucrative. But it seems to be lucrative and focused on purchases that are being made frankly on an impulse basis — that’s a totally different question, about whether that’s a good thing or not, it’s not really right for antitrust law — but it does appear to be disproportionate. I understand this notion that somehow Apple’s bringing the customers to the users. But after that first time, after that first interaction, the [developers] are keeping the customer with the games. Apple’s just profiting off that, it seems to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bvk7l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I view it differently than you do, Your Honor. I view that we are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store, and we’re doing that by focusing on getting the largest audience there. We do that with a lot of free apps, so [even if] we don’t collect a commission from them they bring a lot to the table. And then we have the majority of other people that pay 15 percent, and only the people that are really profiting in a major way are paying 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xakG44"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, but the 15 percent, right... you would agree with the basic proposition that competition is good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VtTbm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I think competition is great. We have fierce competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xD5lbN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t have competition in those in-app purchases, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meLsrP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure, I mean somebody could go if they’re a gamer they could go buy it on the Sony PlayStation or the Microsoft Xbox or the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdOVHr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Only if they know, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0LSTm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, but that’s up to the developer to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrdELJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;And only if they decide to switch in terms of how they do things, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyJjt2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Usually people have both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j17YFs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGgxQA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It was the result of feeling like we should do something from a COVID point of view, and then electing to instead of doing something very temporary, to do something permanent. And of course we had the lawsuits and all the rest of the stuff in the back of our head, but the thing that triggered it was, we were very worried about small business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkfwFU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay, but it wasn’t competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsAWRf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It was competition after we did our 15, it was competition that made Google drop theirs to 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2hcSO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;I understand perhaps that when Google changed its price, but your action wasn’t the result of competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMPFJU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It was the result of feeling like we should do something for small business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDyM1T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;So when other stores reduced their price, Steam reduced their price, you felt no pressure to reduce your price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNEa3r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m not familiar with Steam and their financial model. One of the things that’s missed here is that there’s a huge competition for developers. It’s not just competition on the user side, it’s also with the developer side, in addition to the users. You can imagine that if we had an above-market kind of commission, people just wouldn’t develop for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkopGC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s talk about developers. I’m seeing evidence in the record that there’s a survey of developers — I’m going to share the results of this bar graph that was presented to me. I don’t know how accurate it is, because I looked for the source document and couldn’t find it. But this survey indicated that 39 percent of developers were either very dissatisfied or somewhat dissatisfied with Apple’s distribution services. 36 percent were somewhat satisfied or very satisfied, and 19 percent didn’t go either way, they’re in the middle. So with 39 percent of all your developers dissatisfied, how is that acceptable and how is it — assuming those numbers are true — how is it that you’re feeling any motivation and incentive to address their needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTKhn0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m not familiar with the document you’re referencing, and so it’s hard to comment on certain specifics. But keep in mind that on a weekly basis, we’re rejecting 40 percent [of apps sent for review], so there’s definitely some friction in the system. But this friction is what produces a curated experience for users, that they love and they can go somewhere and be assured that it’s safe and trusted. So sometimes the developer and the user, their interests don’t intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzMT1n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But it doesn’t seem to me that you feel under pressure or competition to actually change the manner in which you act to address the concerns of the developers — again, if these numbers are right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nVeW4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I would look at it in a different way. We turn the place upside down for developers. Look at a complaint that I might get, and look at the amount of time for a change to be made in the company. It’s amazing, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdJOFy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve seen a number of profit and loss statements, and again you see the 100 binders behind me — I don’t recall seeing any other surveys or any other business records showing that you routinely conduct surveys regarding developer satisfaction and that you in fact move or make changes. I take with a grain of salt each side’s anecdotal evidence. What I’m looking for are aggregates. Do you do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BvpYW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t know if we do that. That would be something that Phil [Schiller] would know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4r3fT1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;You certainly as the CEO then don’t receive regular reports on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoQmq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkM4yM"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The new Apple TV 4K lets you play any TV audio through a HomePod</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnB1aCr1PINh7qb269C4LjovO0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69324126/jbareham_180202_2266_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoIl6l"&gt;Apple might have discontinued the original, full-size HomePod smart speaker, but the company is continuing to add new functionality to it. The latest one relies on you also buying the new, second-generation Apple TV 4K, however. If you own both products, there’s now built-in support for HDMI ARC and eARC, which lets the HomePod play audio from other devices plugged into your TV — not just an Apple TV streaming box. Gaming consoles should work; same goes for Blu-ray players or even another streaming gadget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv22Xu"&gt;The feature can be &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/play-audio-from-tv-inputs-homepod-apple-tv/"&gt;enabled in the “video and audio” area&lt;/a&gt; of the Apple TV settings menu. There you’ll see a field labeled “Audio Return Channel (beta),” where you can tell the Apple TV to route all television audio through HomePod speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNZn0V"&gt;I haven’t tested this yet, so I can’t speak to any latency issues that could negate its appeal for gaming, but it’s nice to see the HomePod gaining new tricks even after Apple has officially brought an end to sales of the product. (You can still find them at retailers including Apple itself.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fWzyc"&gt;This continued evolution of home theater features is also a hint that Apple could have more speakers in the pipeline. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported last month that the company is in the early stages of development on a product that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379470/apple-tv-homepod-speaker-camera-video-call-soundbar-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;combines an Apple TV, speaker, and camera&lt;/a&gt;. For now, the $99 HomePod Mini stands as the lone smart speaker that Apple is actively marketing. Unfortunately, that device does not support the new audio return channel feature described above. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdo8Sp"&gt;Spotify is adding the ability to download playlists, albums, and podcasts on Apple Watch to play offline, the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-21/enjoy-more-ways-than-ever-to-use-spotify-on-your-apple-watch-now-with-downloads/"&gt;company announced Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Users will be able to stream audio in 96kbps, add and delete Spotify content on their phones, and sync with the Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o43TIr"&gt;“Being able to download music and podcasts complements the existing feature of being able to stream your favorites from the watch, and now you don’t even have to take your phone with you,” the company said in its news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OHlogg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;Your browser does not support HTML5 video.&lt;source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pr-newsroom-wp/1/2021/05/Apple-Watch-2021-Landscape.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OpEGi5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549483/spotify-apple-watch-streaming-music-rolling-out"&gt;Spotify added the ability to stream&lt;/a&gt; music using an Apple Watch in November; until that point, the Apple Watch only worked as a remote for Spotify music playing on an iPhone or other Spotify Connect-compatible device. Spotify first launched its Apple Watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18063838/spotify-apple-watch-download-features"&gt;app in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaQy18"&gt;The offline feature will be available starting Friday on Apple Watch Series 3 or later running WatchOS 6.0 or later, with WatchOS 7.1 and up recommended. A Spotify Premium subscription is also required. &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/"&gt;Spotify Premium memberships&lt;/a&gt; range from $9.99 per month for a single account, up to $15.99 per month for a family plan. There’s also a $4.99-per-month student account option available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6etuX"&gt;Another streaming music service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443522/deezer-apple-watch-offline-listening"&gt;Deezer, beat Spotify to the punch&lt;/a&gt;, adding the ability to download music from its Apple Watch app earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQfU4g"&gt;Also this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;Spotify said it was launching a new feature&lt;/a&gt; to allow Google’s Wear devices to download music and listen offline, without needing an accompanying phone. It hasn’t been released yet, but it’s in the works, the company’s product lead for wearables said &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/D_mVOAXcrtc?t=2515"&gt;during Google’s developer keynote&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV Siri Remote review: pushing all the right buttons</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’ve got an Apple TV, it’s a must-have upgrade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L7aLVB"&gt;It’s so, so, so much better. But the moment Apple showed off the second-generation Siri Remote, it was obvious that this would be a huge improvement over its detested predecessor. It’s easy to tell which way is right side up when you reach for it. The clickable touchpad area that dominated the upper third of the prior remote has been replaced by a more intuitive D-pad. The Siri button has been pushed to the remote’s right side, almost guaranteeing that you’ll never unintentionally trigger Apple’s voice assistant. And now there’s a proper power button for your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFcXYL"&gt;Listing all of these “upgrades” on the new $59 Siri Remote really illustrates just how disappointing the old one that somehow lasted six years on the market was. Before this big redesign, the most Apple did in that time was to try to cure the “which side is up?” confusion by adding a white rim around one of the buttons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442395/at-the-epic-trial-phil-schiller-got-away-clean"&gt;“Can’t innovate anymore, my ass.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFTwoI"&gt;But this? This new Siri Remote is a very good remote. There’s nothing exceptional about it, but it’s functional, accessible, and painless to use. If you used those words to describe the original Siri Remote, you’d be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;in the minority&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="domTV5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10511307"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCQTI2"&gt;It feels really nice, too. Apple makes the remote from a unibody aluminum shell that’s taller, heavier, and considerably thicker than the old Siri clicker. It’s slightly narrower than the black remote but still feels larger on the whole — and that’s a positive. The previous Siri remote was so thin that it was easily lost to the deepest reaches of the couch. I don’t see that being as much of a problem with the new, chunkier hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J20Dix"&gt;The Siri Remote is in keeping with Apple’s renewed fondness for hard edges. With the remote gripped in hand, you never really feel the edges on the front, but you do at the back. The back metal is curved, but there’s still a hard edge at both sides. As long as you don’t squeeze the remote too tight, it should prove reasonably comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEEcVIBgXK-1bw4weScVml5NO6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529635/DSCF3939.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has added power and mute buttons to the new Siri Remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xda5D"&gt;Instead of putting what basically amounted to a trackpad on the top section of the remote, Apple has switched to a much more traditional directional pad. Within that circular D-pad is a touch-sensitive center button that still lets you swipe around content or move in any direction just like you could before. (And yes, you can still play with the subtle movement of app icons on the home screen by gently nudging your thumb around.) But some streaming apps didn’t work perfectly with that input method, so Apple is now including the far more precise D-pad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttHtGW"&gt;This choose-your-preferred-navigation method — Apple calls it the “clickpad with touch surface” — has a very short learning curve. Initially, I would inadvertently activate the touchpad when I just meant to move my finger from down to up or vice versa on the D-pad. That didn’t last long, but if it winds up a bigger hassle for you, there’s an option in the remote’s settings menu to assign the center button to “click only,” which gives the D-pad all navigation duties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sa8uyQ"&gt;Apple has also come up with a clever jogwheel function that lets you circle a finger around the outer ring to scrub through videos at faster or slower speeds depending on how quickly you’re thumbing around the circle. It’s a direct callback to the days of the iPod clickwheel and does a great job helping you land on an &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; moment in a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGfqfNUpkQIqqzKnv6M2f13zTSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529636/DSCF3948_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new clickpad is infinitely better than the prior touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aa0he1F9Qr__5W97w2f4nWIT680=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529710/DSCF3949.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Siri button is now on the side, where you’re less likely to press it accidentally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="12zYjz"&gt;But I must confess something: I had an embarrassing few hours where I couldn’t figure out how to make this work. Eventually, I learned the trick: after pausing a video, you’ve got to rest your finger on the D-pad momentarily before you start circling around it. An animation will pop up in the progress bar (with a little dot that indicates where your finger is) to let you know you’re in jogwheel mode. If you just pause the video and immediately start the circular movement, it doesn’t do the right thing. Don’t be like me and unnecessarily factory reset your Apple TV 4K because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xct7Jj"&gt;The buttons themselves all have a satisfying click and don’t feel the least bit mushy. The clickpad is quieter when pressed than the buttons below it, which are each significantly noisier than any other remotes I had to compare against, be it for a Roku, Chromecast, or otherwise. Again, it’s not a problem unless you’re sensitive to that sort of thing, but you’ll absolutely hear the volume rocker when you’re turning up a certain scene in a movie or show. The Siri button on the side is whisper quiet; you still have to press and hold it down whenever you’re doing a voice command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM0hLg"&gt;You might also have to overcome some muscle memory challenges since the mute button is now where play / pause was situated on the old remote. The “menu” button has been rebadged as “back” but does the same functions as before, which means, in most cases, the new icon makes a ton more sense. The buttons aren’t backlit, but it’s easy enough to memorize them by feel once you’ve used the remote for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CBdcQqhgCwpu8-dCcM6PyV6lQFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529631/DSCF3906_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a circular D-pad with a touchpad in the center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EVCHZA"&gt;But as good as the new Siri Remote is, it feels like Apple missed some opportunities that frankly seem like low-hanging fruit. The most glaring is that there’s no way to locate the remote if you’re unable to find it. As I said earlier, the bigger dimensions should make for fewer instances where the remote gets misplaced, but &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; way of having it alert you to its location would’ve been nice. “Hey Siri, where’s my remote?” seems like such an easy thing to make happen, but that voice query won’t do you any good or make the remote beep. And unlike Apple’s recently introduced AirTags, there’s no ultra-wideband chip in the remote to help pinpoint its position in a room. If you’re finding that the remote goes MIA constantly, you might just have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/5/10/22429238/apple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design"&gt;settle for a case&lt;/a&gt; that combines an AirTag with the Siri Remote. But having a simple, straightforward remote locator feature is one area where Roku objectively beats out Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWIcIl"&gt;A less impactful gripe is the lack of an input button for switching between HDMI sources; the Apple TV automatically becomes the active input when you power it on or wake it from sleep. But an input button would’ve at least made life easier for people switching between an Apple TV and an Xbox or PlayStation. As a result, I just can’t quit my LG TV’s remote, much as I wish I could. Most of my devices automatically grab the TV’s attention when they’re switched on, but a button is foolproof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bflUJ0BqVtj70FwQYOsJ7UUuB2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529634/DSCF3938.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Siri Remote is substantially thicker than the previous one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91i2a-8hNAVdxgdT5m38ROEYGso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529633/DSCF3923.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hopefully it won’t go swimming in couch cushions as often.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13pTzo"&gt;I can complain about buttons being absent, but I can also praise Apple for the same reason: there are no branded shortcut buttons whatsoever on the Siri Remote. Not even Netflix can lock down its own button, whereas you’d be hard-pressed to find another streaming box remote without that logo somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="EcTqGE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10511751"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="88lBKt"&gt;The Siri Remote still charges with Apple’s Lightning connector — despite now being thick enough to house a USB-C jack. USB seems more natural for this type of scenario, but what do I know? I’m just one man who’s elated to have a reliable, sensibly designed remote control again. Apple is going to keep doing Apple things. I was not able to test the new remote with third-party charging stands designed for the old one, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that industry catches up with the new design in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AvEaeLXu1kCNhxDZlwfv3vN_huE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529638/DSCF3951.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The right choice is clear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y4avp2"&gt;The gyroscope and accelerometer from the previous Siri Remote are history, so you won’t be able to use this one for Apple Arcade games that rely on those sensors. But it’s unlikely many people were gaming with it to begin with; tvOS now supports many third-party gamepads, including the latest Xbox and PlayStation controllers, if you hadn’t heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4IiJSM"&gt;Any way you slice it, the new Siri Remote is a win on every level. It’s inconceivable that we put up with the last one for so many years, but its time has come. And the remote control taking its place is extremely good at doing remote control things. Much as how Apple’s M1 MacBooks would have earned perfect scores if they’d had competent webcams, the Siri Remote would be flirting with perfection if it just had some way of letting you easily find the thing. Or if the buttons were backlit. My review of the new Apple TV 4K is coming soon, but if you’ve already got the last model, this is the only real must-have upgrade to go for. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kensington’s $399 StudioDock won’t fit the new, slightly thicker 12.9-inch iPad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1t1l2OADILkzW4pksRMRx4_UTk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69321578/DSCF7579.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmzK2w"&gt;Kensington’s StudioDock, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"&gt;high-end $399.99 desktop hub for the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; that was released earlier this year, isn’t compatible with the new 12.9-inch model hitting stores today. A representative for Kensington confirmed the news to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying it’s because the new iPad Pro is 0.5mm thicker than the 2018 and 2020 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ezaBH"&gt;The StudioDock uses a rotatable magnetic mounting plate to secure the iPad when it’s plugged in over USB-C, expanding its connectivity with extra USB-A, ethernet, and HDMI ports. Although the only difference between the StudioDock versions for the 12.9-inch and 11-inch iPad Pro is the size of that mounting plate, Kensington says it won’t be user-replaceable. Instead, the company plans to release an entirely new SKU to fit the 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2AUaAU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NUKh4H"&gt;The new 11-inch iPad Pro should be unaffected, because its dimensions are the same as last year’s model. The 12.9-inch version, however, is slightly thicker because it uses a new, more advanced display with Mini LED technology. Apple itself has warned that its 2020 Magic Keyboard “may not precisely fit” the 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro due to this difference in thickness, although we found it worked fine in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhUgUb"&gt;No such luck for the StudioDock — you’ll need to buy a whole new one if you want to upgrade your iPad. This wasn’t entirely unforeseeable, and I warned of the possibility when reviewing the StudioDock in March because new iPad Pro models did seem overdue. But the incompatibility is unfortunate for such an expensive product, especially since it was only just released.&lt;/p&gt;
