    <title>Apple’s Fraggle Rock reboot looks like it will stay true to the original series</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUyEv1Id0bbESAfJb4wiFjEHK1k=/0x114:2190x1574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352534/010522_Fraggle_Rock_Back_Rock_Debut_Big_Image_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zN4u7t"&gt;Apple released a new trailer for its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt; Apple TV Plus reboot on Wednesday (officially titled &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock&lt;/em&gt;), and it seems like the new series will be bringing back all of the hallmarks of the original show. The new trailer features charming puppets, a catchy song, and a dumb joke to kick things off that I actually found kind of funny, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H21eTqk9BP8"&gt;watch it all here&lt;/a&gt;. The 13-episode series debuts on January 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQNOI4"&gt;Apple TV Plus has become something of a destination for &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt;. In April 2020, the company debuted the first in a series of shorts called &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock: Rock On!&lt;/em&gt;, and in May 2020, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271931/fraggle-rock-apple-tv-plus-new-series-licensed-strategy"&gt;acquired past seasons of the original show&lt;/a&gt;. (Seems like someone over at Apple is a &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt; fan. Maybe Tim Cook?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnzBAT"&gt;The new series joins Apple TV Plus’ growing lineup of original shows geared toward children, which also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887382/apple-tv-plus-kids-trailers-content-snoopy-sesame-street-ghostwriter-helpsters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Snoopy Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Harriet the Spy,&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;em&gt;Ghostwriter&lt;/em&gt; reboot, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20873176/apple-tv-plus-helpsters-ghostwriter-trailers-childrens-shows"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helpsters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s camera-equipped Nest Hub Max smart display is $40 off </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0tH1Yi"&gt;If you’re keeping track of the ludicrous amount of things being announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;at CES this week&lt;/a&gt;, you already know there are plenty of new toys to look forward to coming down the pipeline in 2022. Though, as excited as we are, most of it is going to be &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;costly. We love the idea of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;97-inch TV&lt;/a&gt; as much as the next person, but let’s instead take a look at some great deals on tech we can own today that shouldn’t require a second mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AenlLd"&gt;Starting us off, the Google Nest Hub Max is a sizable 10-inch smart display with a loud speaker and a camera, and you can get it for $189 ($40 off) — just $10 short of its very best price from Black Friday. It’s available in chalk or charcoal colorways at this price from &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00426us.html%3Fsterm%3DX6p2ms0xpxyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkG1LVXx1ykOzY0&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Chalk%2F842552117&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1499418-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00426_us_nest_hub_max_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F5%2F22866724%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-max-xbox-headset-ring-floodlight-camera-plus-elgato-facecam-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgl7sMUfbAL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This deal is similar to the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2022/1/4/22865019/google-nest-hub-apple-watch-series-7-wacom-one-airtag-loop-lg-a1-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we mentioned yesterday&lt;/a&gt; on the smaller seven-inch Nest Hub, though the Max offers better sound quality, more screen real estate for viewing that excellent Google Photos-powered homescreen, and a camera for video calls. It’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart displays&lt;/a&gt; you can buy today, especially if you value Google’s software experience and app ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SuM449"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872961"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DGxkJf"&gt;Staying in the neighborhood of smart home tech while hopping the fence to Amazon’s walled garden of products, the Ring Floodlight Camera Plus is currently on sale for $149 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1648374-REG%2Fring_b08f6gpqq7_1080p_floodlight_cam_wired.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F5%2F22866724%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-max-xbox-headset-ring-floodlight-camera-plus-elgato-facecam-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. The floodlight camera space has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many solid options&lt;/a&gt; and continues to get more competitive with a recent addition from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s Nest&lt;/a&gt;. This camera from Ring is a more affordable counterpart to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera#2RQz7P" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ring Floodlight Cam Pro&lt;/a&gt; and features 1080p recording with bright LED lights, night vision, and weather resistance (it’s meant to live outside, of course). At this discounted price of $149, it’s a full $100 cheaper than the higher-end Pro model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="91lnlU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10612148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mgVeSG"&gt;Let’s shift to cameras more focused on letting the world see that lovely face of yours. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgl7KrsqhbL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has the Elgato Facecam for $30 off on its Deal of the Day. This drops the popular streamer cam down to $170, matching its all-time low price. Speaking of matching, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0973DV11T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is currently matching this deal as well. The Facecam lacks a mic but offers a solid 1080p feed at 60fps with tweakable picture settings on Elgato’s Camera Hub app. It’s good enough to get a nod in our guide on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best webcams you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, and that $30 discount helps alleviate its biggest downside, its price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VPSy8O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730597"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bKhuw5"&gt;Whether you’re streaming games or just enjoying them, good audio is one of the key factors that can give you a competitive edge or immerse you further in an expansive world. A headset is often the best solution, especially if you’re living the apartment life but like to hear every little detail without annoying your roommates or family. The wired Xbox stereo headset is a great option that’s much more affordable compared to wireless alternatives, and the 3.5mm cable gives it a no-fuss handling for Xbox consoles and Windows PCs. This extra-cool special edition released for the Xbox’s 20th anniversary is currently $59.99 ($10 off) at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Stereo-Headset-20th-Anniversary-SE%2F639773287&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This headset matches the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714394/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-controller-headset-design-preorder-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20th anniversary controller launched alongside it&lt;/a&gt; and features translucent sides with green highlights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="di9u3H"&gt;If that styling isn’t your thing, or if you need an even lower price, the standard black version with the same specs and features is just $46.49 (about $14 off) at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-wired-gaming-stereo-headset-for-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one%2F-%2FA-84004221%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We covered this deal on New Year’s Eve when it was available at Amazon, but you’re forgiven if you started partying a bit early and missed it. Luckily, it’s still available for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aq59Jg"&gt;The 14-ounce model of the Ember temperature-controlled smart mug is $89.99 ($10 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/ember-14-oz-temperature-control-smart-mug2,-gray.product.100799582.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMp8N7"&gt;Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holidays may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods. In fact, we’ve actually been seeing some deals that are even better than they were during the recent shopping holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Si36Ca"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Although we’ve recently seen Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods drop to $90 — their lowest price to date — the second-gen earbuds are currently only on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155135/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693"&gt;Target for $114.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $15 less than their typical asking price. They’re also &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/619717/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=66025&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A66025&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now, where you can pick them up for $119.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sadly, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently only available for slightly less than MSRP. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling them for $169.98&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230713/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals010422&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-77603772"&gt;Target for $169.99&lt;/a&gt;, roughly $10 shy of their full retail price and a far cry from their all-time low of $139.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These retail for $249, but you can buy them right now for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/612734/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro-with-MagSafe-Charging-Case%2F975690481&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $199.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;amp;subid1=Verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not nearly as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still more than $50 off what you’d pay if you were to purchase the earbuds directly from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ri3jYY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirPods Pro 2 may come with lossless audio support and a charging case that makes sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863442/airpods-pro-2-lossless-audio-charging-case-sound"},{"title":"Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864887/apple-new-airpods-pro-year-of-the-tiger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently selling for $479 in most colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610234-REG%2Fapple_mgyj3am_a_airpods_max_silver.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $70. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=airpods+max"&gt;reserve them in green at Micro Center for $429.99&lt;/a&gt;, one of their best prices to date, though they’re only available for in-store pickup in select states.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Targus built Apple’s Find My tracking tech into its Cypress Hero EcoSmart backpack</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cNjAf_-qd8WJS9DIR_KcOVEMMI=/0x71:1590x1131/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347456/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_2.13.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Targus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nZotoS"&gt;In addition to designing several new products for people trying to keep germ-free during a pandemic, Targus is targeting iPhone users &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fblogs%2Fpress-room%2Ftargus-showcases-new-product-range-at-ces-2022-to-empower-a-seamless-life-at-home-in-the-office-or-on-the-go&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866769%2Ftargus-ces-2022-apple-backpack-find-my" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with this new Cypress Hero EcoSmart Backpack that has built-in Apple Find My technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lxezy39SPVc--hHUdNwhSVFs1ZE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144911/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_12.12.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Targus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cypress Hero EcoSmart backpack includes Apple’s Find My technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="un67rC"&gt;In turn, users can also use their backpack to track a lost iPhone by pressing a button in the backpack. The backpack has an integrated battery that’s replaceable and can be recharged via USB, which Targus claims will provide better protection from thieves than a simple tag. Like the other bags in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fcollections%2Fcypress-with-ecosmart%3Fnarrow%3D%255B%255B%2522Features%2522%252C%2522filter_features_Eco-Friendly%2522%255D%255D%26sort_by%3Dcreation_date%26utm_source%3Dpress_release%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DCES_2022_Product_Roundup&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866769%2Ftargus-ces-2022-apple-backpack-find-my" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cypress Hero EcoSmart line&lt;/a&gt;, Targus says this one is built using approximately 26 recycled water bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EnhdZV"&gt;Currently, there is no specific release date for the backpack, but Targus says that the new product will be available in spring / summer 2022 for $149.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Nq4w"&gt;Not an iPhone user or don’t want any built-in tracking? Targus is also expanding &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/targus-showcases-new-product-range-at-ces-2022-to-empower-a-seamless-life-at-home-in-the-office-or-on-the-go-301453009.html"&gt;its antimicrobial accessory line&lt;/a&gt; at CES 2022 — a line meant to stand out in a pandemic consumer market in a way that marketing exec Andrew Corkill says will “address productivity, sustainability, and health and wellness initiatives to enable a seamless life.” That includes other backpacks, plus a briefcase, slipcase, and laptop sleeve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CZv7M"&gt;Targus also announced a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fblogs%2Fpress-room%2Ftargus-and-synaptics-to-introduce-world-s-first-universal-hybrid-dock-with-bio-authentication-via-built-in-fingerprint-id-at-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866769%2Ftargus-ces-2022-apple-backpack-find-my" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C Hybrid / Universal 4K Quad Dock&lt;/a&gt; with fingerprint ID compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and Chrome OS. It supports either single-display 8K resolution output or four 4K displays. It will be available this month as the Dock720 for $442.99 while a Dock710 without enterprise-grade biometrics capabilities will be available for $372.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQgJQO"&gt;Finally, Targus says &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225509/targus-anti-microbial-keyboard-light-and-backpack-ces-pandemic"&gt;the UV-C LED Disinfection Light it announced at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt; to keep keyboards clean is now “the world’s first certified disinfection unit for commercial use under UL 962” and will be available in February for $299.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China launches iPhone and Android apps for its digital currency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="E-CNY App" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4e_BYJTjmcR5EJVt5qnFHmWhzg=/0x30:4536x3054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347284/1237534100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Liu Junfeng / Costfoto/Future Publishing via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A2PvGd"&gt;China has rolled out a pilot version of an app that allows users to store and pay with digital yuan, also known as e-CNY, as reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3162094/china-digital-currency-e-cny-wallet-lands-app-stores-ahead-winter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And no, the digital yuan isn’t a cryptocurrency — it was developed by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to replace banknotes and coins; thus, it isn’t a decentralized form of payment, nor will it operate on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnnz0d"&gt;Although it might sound like we already pay with digital cash when we use a credit card or an online payment service like PayPal and Apple Pay, the digital yuan isn’t anything like that. e-CNY is essentially physical cash converted into a digital form, and it’s been in the works since 2014. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chinas-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, distribution of the digital currency will take place using a two-tier system that transfers e-CNY from the PBOC to commercial banks. Banks will then distribute the currency directly to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ROAvbN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As we get closer to the Beijing Olympics, China may use the currency as a way for visitors to easily make payments&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5lvPyq"&gt;Since the e-CNY isn’t a decentralized currency like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it doesn’t promise the same kind of privacy. The &lt;a href="https://www.db.com/news/detail/20210714-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work"&gt;Deutsche Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; s&lt;/em&gt;ays it will have “controlled anonymity,” meaning users can choose to conceal their identities from counterparties, but it will still let the authorities monitor transactions for illegal activities like money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdVLGG"&gt;Digital payment apps like WeChat and AliPay already have a strong foothold in China, with around &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17409/most-popular-digital-payment-services-in-china/"&gt;nine in 10 Chinese people&lt;/a&gt; saying they used either app within the past year. It might seem unlikely for the Chinese to want to switch over to the digital yuan, but China has been working hard to promote it. Within the past two years, cities throughout China have even been holding lotteries, distributing a total of &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3104832/chinas-shenzhen-giving-away-millions-sovereign-digital-yuan"&gt;10 million digital yuan (worth about $1.47 million USD at the time)&lt;/a&gt; to people in Shenzen in October 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3112724/chinese-city-hand-out-virtual-red-packets-part-digital-yuan"&gt;20 million digital yuan (or ~$3 million USD)&lt;/a&gt; in Suzhou in December 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/chinese-city-chengdu-launches-6-million-digital-currency-test.html"&gt;40.2 million digital yuan (or ~$6.2 million)&lt;/a&gt; in Chengdu in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJDOyi"&gt;Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/digital-yuan-goes-head-to-head-with-alipay-wechat-in-beijing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; covered a trade fair in Beijing, where attendees were shown how to sign up for an account, as well as the many ways to use the digital currency — this includes wearables that users can tap against scanners to pay with e-CNY. As noted in the report, users can fill up their AliPay account with the currency, which suggests both forms of payment might have more of a symbiotic relationship rather than a competitive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrnIQy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; even describes how some banks at the event demonstrated how foreigners could sign up for an e-CNY account using their passport and phone number, as well as convert foreign currency to e-CNY. As we get closer to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, this may be a way for China to leverage the currency as a way for visitors to easily make payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGs3Jr"&gt;The new e-CNY app is available on both China’s Android and Apple app stores, but only people in 10 specific cities, including Beijing, Shenzen, Chengdu, and Shanghai, can use it. And as pointed out by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/china-launches-digital-currency-app-to-expand-usage.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the app will be available to use during the upcoming Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Chipolo Card Spot puts Apple’s Find My network in your wallet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JjQLmLShIBD-BXGR_YTqOZXhxLI=/30x0:1950x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346100/Chipolo_CARD_Spot_Blue_Wallet.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9JESOT"&gt;Chipolo has a new Bluetooth tracker it’s announcing at CES 2022: the $35 Chipolo Card Spot, a new version of the company’s credit card-shaped Spot tracker that utilizes Apple’s Find My Bluetooth network for locating missing objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGQD1s"&gt;The idea of a credit card-shaped tracker for your wallet is nothing new, of course — &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-card"&gt;both Chipolo&lt;/a&gt; and more established competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716868/tile-mate-pro-slim-sticker-trackers-update-range-volume-water-resistance"&gt;like Tile&lt;/a&gt; have been making them for years. But like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372099/chipolo-one-spot-bluetooth-tracker-find-my-apple-airtags"&gt;Chipolo One Spot released last year&lt;/a&gt;, the Card Spot ditches Chipolo’s own Bluetooth tracking network in favor of support for Apple’s Find My mesh network, used by AirTags and other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="va4boc"&gt;Chipolo has been a smaller player in the Bluetooth tracking world for years, but it’s made its presence more known in recent months thanks to its quick support for Apple’s Find My network (the company actually announced its One Spot tracker before Apple’s AirTags were officially revealed). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sogpuBBwK6UeAWr4ukGRawKYYu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128907/Chipolo_CARD_Spot_Thin_as_it_gets.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zvvBi7"&gt;The Card Spot supports the usual Find My feature set, including marking an item as missing with Apple’s Lost Mode and the recently added iOS 15 feature to “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212765"&gt;Notify When Left Behind&lt;/a&gt;” which, as the name implies, notifies you automatically if you leave your tracker (and the wallet that presumably contains it) behind. Unlike Apple’s AirTags, though, the Card Spot doesn’t have an ultra-wideband radio, meaning that it won’t be able to do the hyper-local tracking that Apple’s first-party tags can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP43Gu"&gt;On the spec side of things, the Card Spot has an audible alert that reaches 105dB in volume with a 200-foot range, while measuring in at 0.09 inches thick (or about three times as thick as an average credit card). The Card Spot also offers IPX5 water resistance, although the battery isn’t removable. Instead, Chipolo says that each Card Spot should offer about two years of battery life, with a return program that lets customers ship in their old tracker to be recycled in exchange for a 50 percent off discount code on a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cdkOc"&gt;Preorders start January 4th, with the first Card Spots set to ship in February. Customers will be able to &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-card-spot"&gt;buy the Card Spot for $35&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-card-spot-2-pack?variant=781948"&gt;discounted two-pack for $60&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-spot-bundle?cl=header"&gt;“Spot Bundle”&lt;/a&gt; of two One Spot trackers and one Card Spot tracker for $77. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s latest Nest Hub display is nearly half off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zgWII76WV90UwPBnTDmDt_r4oJc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345651/dseifert_20210323_4485_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s latest Nest Hub is on sale today for just $59.99, its second-best price to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ip6mXW"&gt;If you were secretly hoping for a smart home display for Christmas but didn’t receive one, today you can treat yourself to one of the best for almost half its usual price. Right now, you can grab Google’s second-gen Nest Hub — our pick for one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;best smart displays&lt;/a&gt; — for its second-best price to date at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1629831-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01331_us_nest_hub_2_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865019%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-apple-watch-series-7-wacom-one-airtag-loop-lg-a1-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglklYIiBv6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1181395/1036?subId1=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga01331us.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $99.99, it’s currently on sale for $59.99, which is only $10 shy of its all-time low during Black Friday. As mentioned in our review, Google’s small second-gen smart display remains an excellent digital photo frame for displaying images from Google Photos, and it offers automatic and reliable sleep-tracking features. It’s also a better speaker than its predecessor and grants you access to Google Assistant’s full suite of features. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="r49OiG"&gt;We’re four days into 2022, and if you’re starting to struggle with your New Year’s fitness resolutions, 1) welcome to the club and 2) today’s Apple Watch Series 7 deal may be just what you were looking for. For those still resolved to get healthier this year, you have another chance to snag Apple’s latest smartwatch for its lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is once again selling the 41mm, GPS-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 in green with a matching Sport Band for $339 instead of $399 after briefly offering the same discount two weeks ago. The Apple Watch Series 7 offers a larger, edge-to-edge display than its last-gen counterpart, along with IP6X dust resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gFFySg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OfP5UO"&gt;On the other hand, if you’re more the type of person who prefers lounging around watching TV over going for a run, 1) again, welcome to the club, and 2) we’ve got a solid deal on a relatively inexpensive OLED. LG’s A1 OLED offers deep black levels, great color accuracy, and wide viewing angles, along with support for both Alexa and Google Assistant. It doesn’t offer the advanced gaming features found with the more expensive LG C1, like variable refresh rate and HDMI 2.1 ports, but if features don’t matter to you, this more budget-friendly OLED might be worth checking out. Right now, you can pick up the A1 in the 48-inch configuration at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164937252697%3Famdata%3Denc%253AAQAGAAAAkPb26u5XMepclSzddcMwulBMyRV7VoW7jhFGXzqcUALNBOfJF40hvardXAswI2hhBD%252FV9LwELQn5%252BpYRjH9OqNpRBcQRO4riIzygFfx%252BN1mdH588QsfiP1SZMz2OOdJxP7SlL7X1TehcgQQNos0bWwl0fLSgnZj%252FDLs22rdTUl7kLyufQSQ053Ou5CEXrYLMZQ%253D%253D%257Ctkp%253ABFBMxO2r1sRf%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3Dvergedeals010422%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865019%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-apple-watch-series-7-wacom-one-airtag-loop-lg-a1-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $846.99, or $849.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglGbOlG5KN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; instead of paying its original $1,199.99 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pYtoHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10959416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KIdKv3"&gt;Looking for a way to express your creativity at a discount? Wacom’s most affordable drawing tablet is now available for its best price to date. Geared toward entry-level artists and social media content creators, Wacom’s One Drawing Tablet &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082LZXQ6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $299.95 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $100 off of the typical listing price. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21028405/wacom-one-tablet-pen-display-android-price-macos-windows-ces-2020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hands-on impressions left us impressed&lt;/a&gt; with this tablet, namely its matte display, which felt great to draw on. The 13-inch, 1920 x 1080 HD slate is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS, as well as some Android tablets and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJuiNy"&gt;Additionally, the Wacom One comes with a pressure-sensitive stylus and limited-time access to various creative software services, including a two-month subscription to Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, along with six months of access to Adobe Fresco. Note, however, that the drawing tablet lacks support for USB-C, so you’ll need a dongle to connect it to newer MacBook models and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FyisAx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10959354"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvajca"&gt;Nintendo Switch owners can nab a complimentary 128GB SanDisk microSD card from Best Buy when they purchase an &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglmcaHay7K" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;annual family membership to Nintendo Switch Online for $34.99&lt;/a&gt;. The membership grants up to eight local Switch users access to more than 70 SNES and NES games, along with perks like online multiplayer, exclusive offers (like access to purchase one of the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-64-controller.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard-to-find wireless Nintendo 64 controllers&lt;/a&gt;), and cloud storage for game saves. SanDisk’s bundled microSD card, meanwhile, gives your Switch an extra 128GB of storage, so you can store more games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Schlage announces first Apple Home Key-compatible smart lock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i66y4veI_-UCewosbPTB3Dnares=/0x72:4171x2853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345536/Schlage_Encode_Plus_with_home_keys_phone_TaptoUnlock__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Schlage Encode Plus is the first Apple home key smart lock.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Schlage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BogEBd"&gt;At CES 2022 this week, lock manufacturer Schlage announced it is launching the first lock in North America to support Apple’s Home Key. The Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt is an updated version of the popular Schlage Encode WiFi smart lock, adding an NFC chip for the Home Key function, as well as a Thread radio to support HomeKit over Thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3m5d9"&gt;Home Key, introduced with iOS 15, lets you store a digital door key in your Apple Wallet and lock and unlock your door by tapping your device on the lock, similar to how Apple Pay or Apple Transit works. The system uses the iPhone’s or Apple Watch’s NFC chip to authenticate a user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F0yh0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.schlage.com/en/home/smart-locks/encode-plus.html"&gt;Schlage Encode Plus&lt;/a&gt; will be available in spring 2022 for $300 (that Plus moniker comes with a $50 price hike from the original Encode). The Schlage Sense, a HomeKit-only lock that doesn’t support Home Key, is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YUPDV34/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;still available for $200&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1I2plVQ0OjwEWwwI_fu_WcNcHSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134609/Encode_Plus_CEN_Satin_Nickel_Front_Door__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schlage Encode Plus works with HomeKit, Alexa, and Google and doesn’t require a hub or bridge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pCb1Oo"&gt;The addition of Home Key gives the Encode a feature available on other door locks that so far it had been largely lacking — a hands-free way to unlock the door (if you use the watch option, that is). You can also control it with an app, a keypad, a regular key, and voice control using Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b76WbY"&gt;Home Key has two modes for unlocking: “Express Mode,” where you don’t have to unlock your phone, and “Require Face ID or Passcode,” which adds the step of authenticating with Face ID or Touch ID. If you lose your phone, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210515#markaslost"&gt;enabling Lost Mode through Apple’s Find My feature&lt;/a&gt; will disable all elements of your Apple Wallet, including Home Key. If your phone battery is dying, you can still unlock the door with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20991458/apple-pay-express-transit-london-tfl-feature-available"&gt;Power Reserve feature introduced in iOS14&lt;/a&gt;. It works in the same way it does with Express Transit mode, functioning for up to five hours after the red Power Reserve icon appears on an Apple Watch or iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RuHQv"&gt;Home Key also brings with it the option to manage access keys in HomeKit, so you can have different codes for different folks. A nice feature for families is that once you set up Home Key on your device, every member of the household who is part of your Apple Home automatically has the key added to their wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6aj6bmUukeqwtTnT3gXqoPN_MsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134807/Schlage_Encode_Plus_with_Apple_home_keys_Watch_TaptoUnlock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schlage&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When paired with home key, the Schlage lock can be controlled using just your Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dNDpcy"&gt;The Schlage Encode retains the same exterior design and all the existing features of the non-Plus version and integrates with Google and Amazon Alexa smart home platforms for automations and voice control via the Schlage Home app. You can use HomeKit and the Schlage app simultaneously. As a Wi-Fi lock, it doesn’t require any separate hub or bridge for remote access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fk6Hn"&gt;However, the lock can be set up entirely in HomeKit if you prefer, although it requires an Apple Home hub (such as a HomePod Mini or Apple TV) for remote access in this configuration. The Schlage app also adds a few features not in HomeKit, such as scheduling access and a built-in alarm feature. “With this lock, we’re giving our customers the opportunity to use all the different features and integrations — Alexa, Google Assistant, as well as HomeKit,” says Donald Beene, senior product manager for Allegion (parent company of Schlage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z2iwcl"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt|105415" data-volume-uuid="35fe5e45e" data-volume-id="105415" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-982" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;This video produced by Schlage shows the Encode Plus in action.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dhsnYi"&gt;The lock is available in the same styles and finishes as the Encode: the more traditional Camelot design or the more modern Century option. The only physical difference is the addition of two NFC targets on the keypad screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kj7dIS"&gt;The Encode Plus uses four protocols, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and Thread. NFC has been part of Schlage’s commercial options previously, but this is the first time it’s used it in residential locks. There are a few other locks that currently support NFC; one is the Level Lock Touch, but Schlage is the first to come to market in North America with a Home Key-compatible lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4FbFw"&gt;The Thread radio supports HomeKit over Thread specifically, says Beene, and is Schlage’s first Thread-enabled product. The company is closely watching the developing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;, too. “The hardware is here for Matter,” he says. “This will be the first [lock] product with the hardware on board to support something like that, but we still don’t know where those tech specs will land.” Matter is slated to launch in mid-2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nuBXhrxnqWLUTLGTUG3zINky1wE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134824/Schlage_Encode_Plus_Century_in_Satin_Nickel_Exterior_x_Interior.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schlage&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schlage Encode Plus comes in two styles: the contemporary Century (above) and traditional Camelot (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yn75H4o2myz_VbPgYBxZeWYo7fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142274/Schlage_Encode_Plus_Camelot_in_Aged_Bronze_Exterior_x_Interior__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schlage&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Camelot and the Century will come in matte black, satin nickel, and aged bronze (pictured) finishes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="atWqYu"&gt;With all those radios on board, battery life could be an issue. With all-in use — i.e., if you connect the lock over Wi-Fi to the Schlage app and to HomeKit — the battery life is about four to five months, says Beene. Using HomeKit only, it jumps up to about a year, he says, but you will need an Apple Home Hub for remote access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3UWT9"&gt;The addition of Home Key and HomeKit compatibility makes the Encode Plus one of the most fully featured smart locks on the market (for iPhone owners, although Beene told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company is looking at bringing the NFC function to Android phones). August and Yale’s August-powered smart locks also have wide compatibility with smart home platforms and an auto-unlock feature that uses geofencing to control your lock as you approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHL6rO"&gt;My experience with August locks is that the auto-unlock feature is quite hit or miss. Home Key looks to be a more reliable way to easily unlock your door in a hands-free fashion. Currently, a fingerprint reader is my favorite way to unlock a smart door lock, but we’ll have to wait and see whether this will prove to be a more convenient option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCgEGO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vanv7k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $949.99.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including ones equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult. It’s a slightly different story for the newer M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros, but any bit of savings you can get on the new Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;recently released macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; — but we strongly recommend opting for a newer model now that Apple has introduced its M1 chips across the MacBook Air and Pro lines. There is really no downside to opting for Apple’s own silicon, save for Windows Boot Camp holdouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac%2F2020-mac-mini-macbook-air-macbook-pro&amp;amp;subid1=vergemacbookdealsdecember2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="6Zmiyl"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SBa7t8"&gt;Select a category&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="G7eKsD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals#EVXzol" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sczWsj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals#DTHGG6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uvU72Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals#LYpjlZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TGmZTR"&gt;
&lt;div id="wtaWNU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10961031"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g5HcUQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, although in the past few months we’ve seen it discounted down to $799.99. The best deal at the moment, however, is only available at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5KWB9H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base model for $949.99&lt;/a&gt;. The 512GB model is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in select colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xStRiT"&gt;The MacBook Pro line has been split into two different segments — for the time being. The M1-powered MacBook Pro of 2020 remains the final Touch Bar holdout. It is a sibling to the MacBook Air, introduced at the same time, with similar innards, save mostly for a fan that allows it to run at peak performance for longer. The new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; last year, come with the M1 Pro or optional M1 Max CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Id2Hln"&gt;There are multiple variants of both models, however, we haven’t seen any noteworthy discounts on any configuration outside of Amazon’s $78 discount last month on the 14-inch base model. There are no deals available at the moment, either, though Best Buy will throw in some incentives when you buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggHmcuFlcg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;14-&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglodJJhkbP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;16-inch model&lt;/a&gt;, including six months of Apple Music, 15 months of Microsoft 365 for the price of 12, free security software, and a handful of other special offers. You can also get a discount when you trade in select devices.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it was the beautiful display or the remarkable performance and battery life they exhibited, these premium laptops are investments that we can wholeheartedly recommend. As soon as there’s a price break on these impressive laptops, we’d suggest that anyone in the market for a new laptop consider purchasing one, as they’re likely to move fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oXGxIx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AOJENT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The Touch Bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the Air but geared toward slightly more demanding use cases, and starts at $1,299. The M1-powered base model includes 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. In mid-December, we saw the base model drop down to $1099.99, but right now, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LLDSG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604809-REG%2Fapple_myd82ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo are only selling it for $1,199&lt;/a&gt;. That may not be as steep of a discount, but that’s still a savings of $100. The larger, 512GB configuration with 8GB of RAM is also currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604810-REG%2Fapple_myd92ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo in space gray for $1,349.00&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="PGPvTR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. If you’re looking for a discount, both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon are selling the base model&lt;/a&gt; with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $649 ($50 off), as well as the 512GB variant for $829 instead of $899 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html%2FDFF%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple briefly crossed a $3 trillion market cap</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUabvvoSkfx96vZLhek6NKJjLLU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342842/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5VLcZu"&gt;Apple’s market cap briefly passed $3 trillion on Monday more than a year after it surpassed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;the $2 trillion mark&lt;/a&gt; and three years after eclipsing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17638764/apple-worlds-first-1-trillion-company-market-cap-stock-price"&gt;$1 trillion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Hhyj"&gt;Apple’s huge success is due in large part to the iPhone, which revolutionized the smartphone industry and remains a cash cow for the company. But Apple continues to see strong momentum in its other businesses as well, with its services and Mac divisions reporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;all-time highs in its Q4 2021 earnings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCrPC4"&gt;Shortly after hitting the $3 trillion milestone at around 1:45PM ET, Apple’s market cap dipped below it again. Apple’s market cap must be above the $3 trillion mark when the market closes at 4PM ET for it to officially be designated as the first publicly-traded company with that valuation, and it ended below $3 trillion on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvSXK3"&gt;Apple isn’t the only company in the trillion-dollar club; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value%5D"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;Google parent company Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515623/microsoft-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; all have market caps exceeding $1 trillion. (Facebook parent company Meta breached the $1 trillion milestone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554502/facebook-1-trillion-dollar-market-cap-company-business"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; but is currently sitting below it.) In recent years, Apple has also jostled with others for the crown of the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. It passed Saudi Aramco &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;in July 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though it was overtaken for a time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753251/microsoft-apple-market-cap-business-valuable-company"&gt;by Microsoft in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oQ9fq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 3rd, 4:36PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Apple’s market cap ended the day below $3 trillion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
