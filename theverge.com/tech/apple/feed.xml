  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="TNIRIb"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWFA5k"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JHLP0"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt; Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s just over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people.  While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gY4Mp"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; is your best bet right now. It comes with an excellent 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz fast refresh rate, still a rarity at this price point. Even better, Samsung says it will offer four years of security updates, including three years of major OS upgrades. The A52 5G isn’t the cheapest — it’s priced right at $500 — but that healthy support policy means you’ll get many years out of your investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bkDOPH"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZnehD"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, and you definitely won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOgwn4"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5TvHua"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tETMb0"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAfzxG"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB1ZXR"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7jGjKdcssyDUAL1Vc67gH-WoCNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465667/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best budget Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7CPw9a"&gt;On the Android side, the Galaxy A52 5G is a great option, albeit at the very top of the price range considered in this guide. It includes some features that aren’t too common in a budget phone, like its fast-refresh rate screen, an IP67 water resistance rating, and for now at least, monthly security updates for fast access to bug fixes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s379P4"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIaTf"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating is handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RSNCy0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if you want to make an investment in a phone that you can keep using years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwHMHO"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright-spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 4A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFmNNo"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGMHIJ_EFkQE2rMcf3ISzHc3EYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691927/vpavic_4113_20200721_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ndqid1"&gt;An affordable Android phone with the best camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nCclP5"&gt;If you want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt; Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huw9Ph"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera. It’s based on generation-old technology at this point, but it’s still the best in this class and it can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g65TGg"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrF1h5"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it, putting you first in line for Android updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XggNCE"&gt;Unfortunately, in a little over a year’s time, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be slowing down. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7VV1d"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for well under $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord has very good specs for its price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VceItk"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US, and the company doesn’t plan to sell it in the States. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B grade in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCe0u5"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high refresh rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdWibC"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is strong, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5llXq"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple of selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality, and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t work correctly on US LTE networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;If you want an inexpensive 5G phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zVN77Q"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;If you can afford to spend a little more, you probably should. A device with better support in the long run will save you some money later. But if budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The budget phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;If top-notch battery performance is an extremely important feature in your smartphone, then the Moto G Power should be on your shortlist. It’s capable, and you really will get multiple days of battery life on a charge. But if you’re fine getting by on a battery that’s just average, then we think you’ll be happier with a more well-rounded device.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Play covers all of the basics for well under $200.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zLkqZB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Motorola Moto G Play (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0rkwQp"&gt;The best phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8w9H"&gt;There are plenty of options for those shopping on a tighter budget, but the Motorola Moto G Play is the one that stands out to us. It covers the basics well with a big 5,000mAh battery and a Snapdragon 460 processor that does a good enough job handling daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHIya"&gt;The G Play has a generously sized 6.5-inch screen. It’s a lower-resolution panel at 720p and is difficult to see outside in direct light, but it’s more or less just fine. Camera specs are likewise basic: there’s just one rear-facing 13-megapixel camera that performs well in bright light but isn’t well suited for low-light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTXRvU"&gt;You’ll also want to strongly consider a microSD card purchase with this phone. It only includes 32GB of built-in storage, a lot of which is already occupied by system files. Motorola has only promised security updates for two years, but realistically, the G Play isn’t built to last much longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhtEOa"&gt;It has its shortcomings — the G Play’s performance doesn’t keep up with many phones that are just $50-100 more expensive, for example — but it’s hard to argue with what it does offer for its price: good, basic performance without any major flaws. If there’s flexibility in your budget to spend a little more, you’ll get some meaningful upgrades, like a better camera or a longer-lasting device. But for its price, the G Play does just what it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Epic Games v. Apple trial kicks off with kids screaming ‘free Fortnite’</title>

  &lt;p id="Dwl5W8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22412899/epic-apple-trial-rules-investment-app-payment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; is starting today, and it has begun with a court conference call full of kids screaming for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to return to mobile. The public call line allows anyone to dial in and listen to today’s proceedings, but the court didn’t manage to properly mute all participants for more than 20 minutes. The result was what sounded like a chaotic Discord call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWplnd"&gt;More than 200 participants were dialed into the public line, with many screaming “free &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;” or “bring back &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on mobile please judge.” Others played Travis Scott tunes, chatted away, or advertised their YouTube channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFcNzB"&gt;The trial was supposed to begin at 11:15AM ET, and court clerks could be heard attempting to mute participants multiple times unsuccessfully. At 11:30AM ET, silence finally fell on the line in preparation for the court to hear Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HENwGj"&gt;For a brief period, though, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans were pleading for the return of the game on the iPhone and iPad. Over the next few weeks, we’ll find out whether that’s likely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on Apple MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MacBook Air is the most impressive laptop I’ve used in years" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1z5Ah"&gt;With multiple configurations and various MacBook models available for purchase, including ones equipped with the new M1 processor, finding a deal on an Apple MacBook is not very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals on the Mac mini computer. Of course, there are frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations, and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a full one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base configuration of MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD and typically sells for $999. Right now, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$949 ($50 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ADk8N"&gt;Amazon also has the 512GB configuration on sale; you can get it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5R2GQW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $1,180&lt;/a&gt; ($70 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The MacBook Pro comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1299, but it’s on sale for $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can buy some older MacBook Pro models: one includes the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. It features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and storage configurations. You can save $200 on the 13-inch model at Amazon, which is available in two configurations: a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,600 at Amazon, or you can buy one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; processor for $1,800 at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to the processor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and better speakers. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FZV45H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in space gray on sale for $2,199 ($200 off). There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FV1Y57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another configuration available in the same color&lt;/a&gt;, but more storage (1TB) and an Intel Core i9 processor available for $2,499 ($300 off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QLBQ9T"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the Mac mini is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the mini has Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We have seen this computer go down as low as $600 (for the base model), but you can get it for $30 off its usual starting price of $699 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Why Epic is burning its own cash to cook Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Lh_CWksVTEeNbQChEmAiGYACqo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227410/acastro_210429_1777_epic_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Follow the money, baby&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LsnEyS"&gt;Epic Games didn’t sue Apple to get a big payout, but that’s because the lawsuit itself is an investment. And to rewrite Apple’s rules, Epic is spending a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZOgc0"&gt;The reason Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;got thrown out of the Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt; was that Epic rogue-updated &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to offer a payment mechanism that bypassed Apple’s 30 percent cut of all in-app transactions. Apple booted &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; for violating its rules. Epic threw an… epic… hissy fit about this, culminating in the trial starting this week. While Epic has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;cobbled together an alliance&lt;/a&gt; called the Coalition for App Fairness — along with Spotify, Match Group, Basecamp, and Tile — there’s one more tech behemoth in play. Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/announcing-epic-direct-payment-on-mobile"&gt;runs on Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;. So does &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/EPICGames/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MIZjT6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Fortnite’ pretty much prints cash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sAYbBt"&gt;The fight with Apple echoes Epic’s tactics elsewhere. The Epic Game Store is a clear challenge to Valve, which has an iOS-like store called Steam that also takes a 30 percent cut of sales. In a basic act of moral consistency, the Epic Game Store contains — in addition to games by other developers — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22396021/itchio-epic-games-store-windows-pc-apps"&gt;other game stores&lt;/a&gt;. It also takes only a 12 percent cut of sales. Just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;Microsoft announced&lt;/a&gt; it would cut its take on PC games to 12 percent to match Epic, from 30 percent. (It also filed &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21810025/statement_support_microsoft.pdf"&gt;a letter of support&lt;/a&gt; for Epic in the current case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TY5x2"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said in 2019 that the Epic Game Store’s hardball tactics against Valve will continue until either the store is profitable or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18334865/epic-games-store-versus-steam-valve-pc-gaming-console-war-reimagined"&gt;Valve lowers its cut&lt;/a&gt;. Epic will torch an estimated $593 million by the end of 2021 on the Epic Games Store, according to &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/502037049/21-04-07-Apple-Proposed-Findings-of-Fact-and-Conclusions-of-Law"&gt;court documents in the Apple case&lt;/a&gt;. At many companies, losing this much money would be a problem, but that figure is only slightly more than &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/15/epic-games-shareholders-seeking-to-sell-stake-for-750-million-at-17-billion-valuation/"&gt;Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; revenue from April 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which was $400 million that month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOEqIJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; pretty much prints cash because the video game industry has hit on a business model that almost no other part of the entertainment industry can match: in-app payments. For Spotify, it’s not a fatal problem to dodge the App Store and its cut. I just go to a desktop computer, enter my credit card information, and — thanks to recurring billing — I’m done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iEuk7f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At some level, Apple’s being greedy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3DRoFj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is different, and it’s why a video game company is leading the effort to challenge the App Store payment rules. In &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, if I want to buy a sweet dance move, I spend Epic’s V-Bucks to do it. The store refreshes every day, so if I want the new hotness, I need to act immediately. (There’s also a seasonal pass and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612524/fortnite-crew-subscription-chapter-2-season-5-price-release-date"&gt;a recently-introduced monthly subscription&lt;/a&gt;, but these do not seem to be as explicitly geared toward impulse buys.) Last year, in-app purchases were estimated to account for &lt;a href="https://wappier.com/blog/iap-statistics"&gt;40 percent of all gaming revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bTY20"&gt;Epic’s position gets weirder. Part of the story will involve people who imprinted on Neal Stephenson like ducklings, but before we get there, let’s run down what we know about the economics of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and the Epic Games Store to get a rough sense of how much money is in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="VTAp2k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Unf9lV"&gt;It’s true that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is free to download, but in-app purchases more than make up for that. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/15/epic-games-shareholders-seeking-to-sell-stake-for-750-million-at-17-billion-valuation/"&gt;Epic Games had revenue of $4.2 billion&lt;/a&gt;, with earnings of $730 million. (We know this because Epic, a private company, sold a stake, and &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/15/epic-games-shareholders-seeking-to-sell-stake-for-750-million-at-17-billion-valuation/"&gt;those meddling kids at VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt; got a hold of numbers as a result.) Epic’s 2020 numbers are forecast at about $5 billion in revenue, with $1 billion in earnings, according to VentureBeat; in the court documents, Epic’s total 2020 revenue is projected at a mere $3.85 billion. In the two years &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was available in the App Store, iOS customers alone accounted for $700 million in revenue for Epic, according to the court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNDoFw"&gt;“Epic is in a fortunate position because &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is the most popular game in the world,” says &lt;a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/k/christopher-e-krohn"&gt;Christopher Krohn&lt;/a&gt;, an adjunct associate professor of marketing at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAnBjl"&gt;Apple’s revenue split from digital purchases is a little complicated — it’s got special rates for small developers, for instance — but in Epic’s case, Apple gets 30 percent of all in-app purchases. That’s in line with &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2001/04/minitel-the-old-new-thing/"&gt;Minitel&lt;/a&gt;, the French pre-internet, which also had a 30 / 70 split for third-party content, says Bill Maurer, a professor of anthropology at the University of California Irvine who specializes in payment processors. Frankly, it looks like a carrier fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlGmK5"&gt;“At some level, Apple’s being greedy, because it doesn’t depend on this revenue,” says &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/michael-a-cusumano"&gt;Michael Cusumano&lt;/a&gt;, a distinguished professor of management at MIT’s Sloan Business School. “It’s rolling in money from the iPhone itself.” On March 28, Apple reported its quarterly earnings — almost $24 billion in net income, riding mostly on &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-28/apple-sales-crush-wall-street-estimates-on-surging-device-demand?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;strong sales of the iPhone and Mac&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;previous quarter&lt;/a&gt; was a blowout for the company, with revenue of more than $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="SLZ133"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic wants to build the “metaverse,” an online haven where superhero IP owned by different companies can finally kiss&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6C5qM"&gt;Greed isn’t illegal. It’s also probably what’s motivating Epic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369622/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ban-basic-freedoms-developers"&gt;despite its CEO’s bluster&lt;/a&gt;. Epic wants to build &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;something called the “metaverse&lt;/a&gt;,” an online haven where superhero IP owned by different companies can finally kiss. (The idea is based on &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/neal-stephenson-metaverse-snow-crash-silicon-valley-virtual-reality"&gt;a 1991 book by Neal Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;.) The revenue potential here is the kind of thing that sends VCs into &lt;a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse"&gt;thinkfluencing fever dreams&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzQwSN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is already a hangout space, one where IP from Marvel and DC can legally interact. Add to that the Unreal engine, which fuels a number of games as well as shows such as Disney’s &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, and its other developer tools, and you’re looking at what could potentially be &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-epic-games-metaverse-and-is-it-worth-billions"&gt;a piece of a metaverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Should &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the Epic Games Store, or another Epic offering underpin a major chunk of a metaverse, the amount of money Epic is torching on its store and these lawyers will look like &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/announcing-a-1-billion-funding-round-to-support-epics-long-term-vision-for-the-metaverse"&gt;a wise investment&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;em&gt;fuckload&lt;/em&gt; of money it stands to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zEvaq"&gt;You can see why they might not want to cut Apple — or Valve, or Google, or &lt;em&gt;anyone at all&lt;/em&gt; — in at 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="965O3I"&gt;Look, I’m going to pop my popcorn and, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnites-mastermind-goes-to-battle-with-apple-11619236807"&gt;as Sweeney put it&lt;/a&gt;, “enjoy the upcoming fireworks show” at the trial. I don’t think the outcome will matter much, since any verdict is going to get appealed &lt;em&gt;immediately.&lt;/em&gt; But at the very bottom, it seems obvious that Epic’s position is the same as Apple’s: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVxYOQS6ggk"&gt;greed is good&lt;/a&gt;. Forget the fight to own the metaverse. The &lt;em&gt;real world&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/technology/big-tech-pandemic-economy.html"&gt;belongs to Big Tech&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re just NPCs who drop loot for the corporate players.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit drilled a key ring hole into one of Apple’s AirTags in its latest teardown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qjWuaqSWoKiT3T2cGOMQ104Oicc=/520x0:6139x3746/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69223010/AirTags_31.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iFixit did a teardown of Apple’s AirTags | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50145/airtag-teardown-part-one-yeah-this-tracks" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vEMTjh"&gt;The team over at iFixit has done its teardown thing again, this time examining Apple’s AirTag trackers. Part one of its two-part review digs into the guts of the little trackers, and for those lamenting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;lack of a key ring loop on the AirTag&lt;/a&gt;, iFixit (carefully) drilled a hole into one without damaging any of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="toeOZh"&gt;After some reconnaissance inside our first AirTag, we grabbed a 1/16” drill bit and carefully punched a hole through the second tracker in our four-pack—after removing the battery, of course. We miraculously managed to avoid all chips, boards, and antennas, only drilling through plastic and glue. The best part? The AirTag survived the operation like a champ and works as if nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N4Fe6g"&gt;The team cautioned that you have to remove the battery before drilling, and warned that drilling in the wrong place can cause serious damage. So try this at home only if you have skill with a drill. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pw3-47lsHpedogYeyhCmkJXS_IQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22486455/AirTags_61_drill.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;iFixit drilled a hole into an AirTag for a keyring, and it survived&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ri8tQD"&gt;iFixit compared ‌its AirTags‌ to the Tile Mate and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag. AirTags are the smallest of the bunch, with its 3-volt coin cell removable battery— type CR2032, same as the one SmartTags use—taking up most of the internal space. “All three trackers open up with finger power—no other tools required,” according to iFixit, but they found the AirTag’s was the most difficult to remove. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGxgiDpbRXyrSG3dbBfBG7kjzwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22486466/AirTags_58.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;From left: Tile Mate, Galaxy SmartTag, and Apple AirTag&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SE0xbz"&gt;An X-ray of the three tags shows Apple made efficient use of its internal space, nothing that “the relative darkness of the AirTag [in the X-ray image] is due to a hefty central speaker magnet and its steel battery cover. iFixit tweeted a 360-video of the X-ray image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TVfSJM"&gt;

    <title>Facebook and Instagram notices in iOS apps tell users tracking helps keep them ‘free of charge’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVoAbhSy-1RHpv5ExeQve9Q6zV4=/0x112:890x705/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222709/SpeakingUp_SmBiz_1.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="479dsF"&gt;Facebook is continuing its campaign against Apple’s iOS 14 privacy updates, adding a notice within its iOS app telling users the information it collects from other apps and websites can “help keep Facebook free of charge.” A similar message was seen on Instagram’s iOS app (Facebook is Instagram’s parent company). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6IAaY"&gt;Technology researcher Ashkan Soltani first noted the new pop-up notices on Saturday (see his tweet below), but a Facebook spokesperson directed &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/speaking-up-for-small-businesses/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from earlier last week that detailed the update. The company refers to the notices as “educational screens,” and said they provided “more details about how we use data for personalized ads,” according to the blog post by Dan Levy, Facebook’s vice president for ads and business products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkNfJB"&gt;“This version of iOS requires us to ask for permission to track some data from this devices to improve your ads. Learn how we limit the use of this information if you don’t turn on this device setting,” the screen reads. “We use information about your activity received form other apps and websites to: show you ads that are more personalized, help keep Facebook free of charge [and] support businesses that rely on ads to reach their customers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HWpozB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And it begins.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Facebook&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Instagram&lt;/a&gt; explore additional scare tactics to combat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; iOS14 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ATT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ATT&lt;/a&gt; privacy changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Help keep Facebook free of charge” &lt;a href="https://t.co/mOB9WJpz9A"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mOB9WJpz9A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ashkan soltani (@ashk4n) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashk4n/status/1388270878870310912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oCeMRL"&gt;The new opt-in requirements in the latest versions of iOS 14, including iOS 14.5,  require developers to get express consent from device owners to allow their Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) to be shared and collected across apps. Under Apple’s new policy, app developers are still able to use other information a user provides for targeted advertising, even if the user opts out of letting the app track them, but that information can’t be shared with another company for ad tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gHGFRL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EFu1Kt"&gt;If developers try to get around the opt-in requirement, or try to replace the IDFA with another piece of identifying information such as an email address, that app will be considered in violation of the opt-in requirement. The rules also apply to Apple’s own apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3qB4Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;Facebook has been a vocal critic&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s iOS 14 privacy updates, arguing that the privacy changes could hurt small businesses which may rely on Facebook’s ad network to reach customers. In statements to the press and in newspaper ads, Facebook has said Apple is encouraging new business models for apps so they rely less on advertising and more on subscriptions, which would potentially give Apple a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqb9H0"&gt;But the “keep Facebook/Instagram free” tactic seems to run counter to Facebook’s long-standing tagline which indicated the company was “free and always will be.” Of course, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-changes-free-and-always-will-be-slogan-on-homepage-2019-8"&gt;Facebook quietly removed that slogan from its homepage in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and CEO Mark &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17220534/paid-facebook-ad-free-version-mark-zuckerberg-testimony"&gt;Zuckerberg didn’t rule out a paid version&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook when he testified before Congress in 2018. “There will always be a version of Facebook that is free,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45wcCV"&gt; Zuckerberg called Apple out during &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;Facebook’s January earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, referring to Apple as one of his company’s biggest competitors. “Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” Zuckerberg said. “This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ICqgd"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9w6JfA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: May 2nd, 1:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds information from Facebook including updated image of the screens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOygv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMOjQv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic-backed expert says Apple’s app store profit is as high as 78 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hUiI_MPTLosJoewIUa2j5t8SLnw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69219619/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9a9cP"&gt;An expert witness for Epic Games testified that Apple’s App Store had operating margins above 70 percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484513/ned_barnes_testimony.pdf"&gt;new court documents show.&lt;/a&gt;  Ned Barnes testified that information from Apple’s Corporate Financial Planning and Analysis group show the App Store had a 77.8 percent operating margin in 2019, and 74.9 percent in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rPK8V"&gt;The figures are close to Barnes’ calculations of the App Store’s profits, he testified, and “also refute criticisms of my report proffered by certain Apple expert witnesses that it is not possible to calculate reliably or usefully the operating margins of the App Store.” Barnes also testified that Apple has been tracking its App Store profits for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chGe68"&gt;Apple has hotly contested that interpretation of the data. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/apple-s-app-store-had-78-profit-margin-in-2019-testimony-shows?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s chief compliance officer said at a congressional hearing last month that “we don’t have a separate profit and loss statement for the App Store,” and that Cook has made similar statements about the App Store and how it’s structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8YE6T"&gt;An Apple spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday that Barnes’ figures were incorrect: “Epic’s experts calculations of the operating margins for the App Store are simply wrong and we look forward to refuting them in court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7wd8x"&gt;The question of how much profit Apple makes from the app store is at the center of the ongoing court case between Apple and Epic Games. Epic argues that the App Store provides no real service, but simply serves as a way for Apple to extract money from developers. Epic is suing Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;for antitrust violations&lt;/a&gt; on those grounds, after launching an unauthorized in-app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;payments system for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. But Apple insists the App Store review process is a pivotal part of the broader platform safety efforts around iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQsHN3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484567/schmalensee_testimony.pdf"&gt;Court documents show Apple’s expert witness Richard Schmalensee&lt;/a&gt; also disputed Barnes/Epic’s figures. “Mr. Barnes’ estimate of the App Store’s operating margin is unreliable because it looks in isolation at one segment of the iOS ecosystem in a way that artificially boosts the apparent operating margin of that segment,” Schmalensee said in his written direct testimony. “When one looks at Apple’s device and services ecosystem as a whole, the operating margin falls to an unremarkable level.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Un5tXR"&gt;Schmalensee further testified that “it makes no sense” to try to measure the App Store’s profitability in isolation since it’s part of the iOS platform and relies on all of Apple’s intellectual property. “As top Apple executives will testify, Apple does not calculate P&amp;amp;Ls by products and services because they view it as an unproductive exercise,” according to Schmalensee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Iroz"&gt;Court proceedings for the trial are due to begin on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro? You may have to wait until July</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g58tOJ"&gt;If you’re hoping to get one of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pros with a Mini LED display, you may be waiting a while — the delivery times for even &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F12.9-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi"&gt;the base model&lt;/a&gt; have slipped to late June or early July (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-30/apple-s-new-high-end-ipad-pros-see-delivery-times-slip-to-july"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Leading up to the device’s announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;there were rumors&lt;/a&gt; that the display tech could be a production bottleneck for Apple, and that appears to be the case — Apple’s site says &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F11-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi"&gt;the 11-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, announced alongside the 12.9-inch, would be delivered in late May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOuBkf"&gt;The Mini LED display that could be to blame for the short supply of iPads is a new tech for Apple, but it promises to bring a ton of improvements compared to normal LED displays. However, they’re trickier to produce — Apple says that the previous iPad Pro’s display had 72 LEDs, while the Mini LED version boasts over 10,000. For a more in-depth look at the tech, we have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;an explainer here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="olMtu9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The colorful M1 iMac, Mini LED iPad Pro, and refreshed Apple TV 4K are available to preorder now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22409463/apple-m1-imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-4k-preorders-price-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pIW3kb"&gt;For the most part, the rest of the devices Apple announced in its April 20th event seem to be doing okay stock-wise: Apple’s site says the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12%2F6.1-inch-display-128gb-purple-unlocked"&gt;purple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12%2F5.4-inch-display-128gb-purple-unlocked"&gt;12 Mini&lt;/a&gt; would arrive in early May, and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-tv%2Fapple-tv-4k%2F32gb"&gt;the Apple TV&lt;/a&gt; is shown as shipping by mid- to late May. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-7-core-gpu-256gb%23"&gt;lower-end iMac&lt;/a&gt; will arrive in late May, though the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-256gb%23"&gt;higher-end versions&lt;/a&gt; won’t get to you until early June — the same as the new Siri Remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Au8nJF"&gt;Interestingly, while &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag%2F1-pack"&gt;a single AirTag&lt;/a&gt; seems readily available, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag%2F4-pack"&gt;the four-pack&lt;/a&gt; is a bit harder to come by — Apple’s site has them delivering in June, while &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirTag-4-Pack/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the pack listed&lt;/a&gt; as out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can save up to $147 on a preorder for the latest M1 iPad Pro or iMac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XuagldWx4arBbKfspjX2DG3qcc0=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69211882/lcimg_06ebca85_7eac_4c32_9e8f_4b98fad99ec8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest iPad Pros are powered by the M1 chip.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F58ugb"&gt;Following the official reveal last week of the new model refreshes for the iMac and iPad Pros, all of which are powered by Apple’s own silicon — the M1 chip — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22409463/apple-m1-imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-4k-preorders-price-release-date"&gt;preorders began for all three products today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DCXL7"&gt;As spotted first by &lt;a href="https://9to5toys.com/2021/04/30/apple-m1-imac-expercom-deals/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9to5macToys+%289to5Mac+Toys%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Toys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Expercom is offering an incentive if you pre-purchase any of the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fnew-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-2021-model%3Fvariant%3D39316140621858#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fnew-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-2021-model%3Fvariant%3D39316140621858#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fimac%2Fproducts%2F24-inch-imac-with-apple-m1-7-core-gpu-blue#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1 products&lt;/a&gt;, with up to $147 in savings available depending on the configuration you select, making this the first time any of these three brand-new products have seen a discount yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daDOJC"&gt;The base &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fimac%2Fproducts%2F24-inch-imac-with-apple-m1-7-core-gpu-blue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1 iMac is available for preorder at Expercom&lt;/a&gt; for as low as $1,233 ($66 off); this configuration includes 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. As noted previously, the configurations vary, but there are price reductions for multiple configurations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4AzLJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474631"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fpeu6S"&gt;The 2021 iPad Pros are the first in Apple’s tablet line to include the M1 processor. The 11-inch iPad Pro is more affordable with a starting price of $799. But Expercom is offering the base model, which includes &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fipad-pro-11-inch-1%3Fvariant%3D39316139212834#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage with Wi-Fi only, for $750&lt;/a&gt; — $49 off its usual starting price. You can also select the option to get more storage or 5G network support, all of which vary in price depending on which configuration you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2nBbHZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VEfgW0"&gt;Along with the 11-inch iPad Pro, the 12.9-inch model also receives a model refresh, which includes the M1 chip. This flagship tablet has a new Liquid Retina XDR Mini LED screen and starts at $1,099 for the base 128GB storage configuration with Wi-Fi only. But you can get this &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fnew-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-2021-model%3Fvariant%3D39316139999266#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;particular model for $1,032 at Expercom&lt;/a&gt; with up to $147 off if you get the highest storage configuration plus Wi-Fi and cellular support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="idquVm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Next week’s Fortnite trial could upend Apple’s App Store model — even if Epic loses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0K83EUzfEK24jFSjGX5fNt-lW_s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69211874/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Epic will put Apple’s business under a microscope&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="G21BQ5"&gt;In August 2020, mega-publisher Epic Games decided to stop paying what’s dubbed the “Apple tax”: a 30 percent fee on digital purchases made through the iOS App Store. The company added a new feature to its blockbuster game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, letting users bypass the App Store’s payment system to purchase V-Bucks, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in-game currency. The move violated Apple’s guidelines, and Apple promptly kicked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store. Epic sued Apple for antitrust violations, and on Monday, the case will finally go to court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZP39"&gt;Epic has a clear grievance against Apple: it’s locked out of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021"&gt;billion-plus iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18202736/apple-devices-ios-earnings-q1-2019"&gt;iPad user base&lt;/a&gt;. But US antitrust law focuses on whether a company has hurt &lt;em&gt;consumers&lt;/em&gt; by suppressing competition. So over the next three weeks, Apple and Epic will lay out sharply conflicting stories about how a locked-down App Store affects users. Unlike a lot of tech trial arguments, which focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21506172/oracle-google-java-supreme-court-hearings-oral-arguments-metaphors-qwerty"&gt;abstract hypotheticals and metaphors&lt;/a&gt;, these are vivid narratives about some of the most central products in our lives — and they play into one of the most important debates in US politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pNomsn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic calls Apple a “uniquely powerful” company with “unique control” over iOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="emfoi1"&gt;In Epic’s telling, Apple is a “uniquely powerful” company that exerts “unique control” over iOS devices. Apple routes all downloads and purchases through the App Store for financial gain, exercising little oversight over the actual quality of apps — contradicting a public commitment to privacy and security. It leverages its power in one market (the overall iOS ecosystem) to dominate another (app distribution and payments). That’s created less competition to deliver better service at cheaper rates, so users get stuck paying more and miss out on innovative new services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhPmka"&gt;From the other half of the courtroom, Apple claims Epic is threatening what users love about iOS. Creating a single well-vetted app portal produces a “safe, convenient experience” on a device that stores reams of highly personal information, distinguishing the iPhone from competing platforms. Features that limit app distribution were “conscious, reasonable decisions,” Apple says — not attempts to shut down competition. Far from having consumers’ best interests at heart, Epic would simply force Apple to spend money shoring up new privacy and security holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjxHXO"&gt;Epic is losing out on a significant market with its iOS suspension. Court documents say it earned $700 million over its two years in the App Store, even if PlayStation and Xbox consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407939/fortnite-biggest-platform-revenue-playstation-not-ios-iphone"&gt;were far bigger moneymakers&lt;/a&gt;. Apple plans to argue that iPhone and iPad owners have access to other &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-supporting devices, but Epic counters that most people choose only one platform to play on, so a stymied iOS user won’t necessarily pick up &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="16GQsv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple has a lot more at stake here than Epic does.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NitrDa"&gt;The main impact of the trial, though, won’t be getting one game back on the App Store. A big enough loss for Apple could make the company basically rewrite iOS. “Apple has a lot more at stake here than Epic does, though Apple has the stronger hand,” says Christopher Krohn, adjunct associate marketing professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Krohn notes that early in the case, Epic worried that Apple might cut off its App Store access altogether, threatening Epic’s ubiquitous Unreal Engine. But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400240/epic-apple-ruling-unreal-engine-fortnite-temporary-restraining-order"&gt;blocked that move&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, in Apple’s worst-case scenario, the bench could decide that Apple can’t require all iOS developers to use the App Store — striking at a fundamental tenet of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLcoip"&gt;The bench could also conclude that Apple can maintain App Store exclusivity, but it can’t make developers use its in-app purchase system. While that would be less disruptive, it’s still a big deal. In-app purchases — including subscriptions to countless non-gaming services like Spotify — are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21369460/apple-fortnite-app-store-services-business-model-epic-games"&gt;a huge part&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s business. Apple cut its 30 percent App Store commission to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;15 percent for smaller developers&lt;/a&gt;, but according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;one outside estimate&lt;/a&gt;, those developers accounted for a tiny share of its revenue. Losing money from big players would make the App Store a lot less profitable for Apple, and it’s a strong incentive for the company to push back against third-party subscription-based services — which, right now, dominate much of the app ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lATlm2"&gt;Epic is facing an uphill battle. US antitrust enforcement has languished over the past decade, in part because the consumer harm standard is slippery in a world where so many services are free. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), one of Congress’ biggest proponents of antitrust reform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;called private antitrust suits&lt;/a&gt; “very hard to win” in a recent interview. “This is not straightforward, but Apple probably has an advantage,” concludes Michael Cusumano, deputy dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management. And whoever wins the case, the loser will almost certainly appeal, which could delay any concrete results from the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nCyZHW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The case will put Apple’s policies and security under a microscope&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jH8AC9"&gt;That said, the trial is just one part of a larger antitrust push against Apple, and even if the company wins in court, the trial could prove to be a political turning point in the fight to unwind the app store. Over the next three weeks, Apple executives — including CEO Tim Cook — will be grilled for hours on the company’s history and business practices, including the minutiae of how apps are reviewed and how secure the iPhone is. Any unflattering comments, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;one deposition’s claim&lt;/a&gt; that App Review employees were “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight,” could provide fodder for lawmakers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650861/apple-department-of-justice-antitrust-authority-facebook-google-amazon-ftc-investigations"&gt;watchdog agencies&lt;/a&gt;. The trial also gives a fresh soapbox to disgruntled iOS developers like Match Group, which sent a witness to Congress last week and is scheduled to testify in the upcoming trial as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SHPg3"&gt;Epic court documents also raise issues that are tangential to its complaint but pivotal to the larger antitrust debate. That includes Apple’s strategy of vertical integration — a system where it builds incredibly popular devices like the iPhone, then directly competes with the companies making apps and accessories for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZAsr5"&gt;The European Union has already taken aim at Apple’s App Store practices. Last night, the EU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;issued antitrust charges&lt;/a&gt; over the exact issue that sparked the Epic trial: Apple requiring developers to use its in-app purchasing system. That case is limited specifically to music streaming services like Spotify, but it could expand to ebooks and other digital purchases. “This is not the last case we will have when it comes to the App Store,” warned European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BqEI4C"&gt;If Epic’s case fails, US lawmakers could use it to argue that the law itself is broken. Klobuchar has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;singled out the Apple tax&lt;/a&gt; as an example of anti-competitive behavior run amok, calling for new standards that would apply not only to tech but the entire corporate world. Compared to a court blowing up the iOS ecosystem, that’s still a win for Apple — but it means Epic’s lawsuit could leave a mark well beyond the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dolahs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;With reporting by Elizabeth Lopatto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CLzWx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;The trial is before a bench, not a jury. We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;
