    <title>Apple discontinuing two configurations of its 21.5 inch iMac</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The 21.5 and 27 inch iMacs | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fGSntk"&gt;Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316831/apple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last"&gt;discontinued the iMac Pro,&lt;/a&gt; and two configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are now joining the Pro in retirement. As spotted &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/20/512gb-1tb-ssd-imac-21-discontinued/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 512GB and 1TB SSD configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are no longer available for purchase, with only the 256GB SSD and 1TB Fusion drive versions available to buy on Apple’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlNXBM"&gt;Both configurations appeared &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/21-5-inch-imac-ssd-upgrades-unavailable/"&gt;unavailable for purchase&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s website as of last month, but at the time it was not clear if that was a supply issue or a permanent discontinuation of the two options. But now both the 512GB and 1TB SSD options are gone from the iMac configuration page, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugEhbO"&gt;A big iMac redesign has been rumored in the works for some time. Apple is expected to replace the 27-inch and 21.5-inch versions of the iMac with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt; and will likely revamp the Mac Pro sometime this year. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the update would have a flat-back design and do away with the “chin” beneath the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuOIe5"&gt;The new iMacs are expected to use Apple silicon chips, as the company continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;shift away from Intel chips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Epic’s top execs plan to testify live and in person this May in the Fortnite app store trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DoaZxlVhtkPmXdYhPqG3_Ctapcc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68997766/VRG_TBP_Epic_VS_Apple_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkZunV"&gt;It’s hard to believe it’s only been seven months since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368504/fortnite-apple-google-app-store-brief-incomplete-timeline"&gt;Apple booted &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;Epic Games sprung its antitrust trap&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t have to wait much longer before the behind-the-scenes legal machinations give way to courtroom drama — and, it seems, until Apple and Epic’s top executives take the stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HH4vgl"&gt;In a legal filing Friday evening, Apple revealed that CEO Tim Cook, SVP Craig Federighi, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354367/apple-phil-schiller-fellow-greg-joswiak-head-marketing-store-events"&gt;former marketing chief and current App Store boss Phil Schiller&lt;/a&gt; intend to testify live and in person in the courtroom, among many other tentative witnesses. Epic Games’ CEO Tim Sweeney and VP Mark Rein should be there as well, plus Facebook’s VP of gaming, a Microsoft VP of Xbox business development, and quite a number of directors on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEs5de"&gt;Schiller is expected to spend the most time on the witness stand by far at an estimated 11 hours of examination and cross-examination, which makes sense. Not only has he been in charge of the App Store that’s at the center of the case, but some of his emails and the emails of his subordinates have been under scrutiny — both for this case and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;in the big tech antitrust hearing last year&lt;/a&gt;, one which ended with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504814/congress-antitrust-report-house-judiciary-committee-apple-google-amazon-facebook"&gt;the House Judiciary Committee concluding that&lt;/a&gt; “Apple exerts monopoly power in the mobile app store market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2avXFS"&gt;Apple says its executives “look forward to sharing with the court”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UZEeRl"&gt;Our senior executives look forward to sharing with the court the very positive impact the App Store has had on innovation, economies across the world and the customer experience over the last 12 years. We feel confident the case will prove that Epic purposefully breached its agreement solely to increase its revenues, which is what resulted in their removal from the App Store. By doing that, Epic circumvented the security features of the App Store in a way that would lead to reduced competition and put consumers’ privacy and data security at tremendous risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wNRhb7"&gt;The trial &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.116.0.pdf"&gt;should tentatively begin May 3rd&lt;/a&gt;, and is expected to run several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGZBUm"&gt;You can find the full list of tentative witnesses and those who’ll be tentatively deposed below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro looks even better than a real one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKfzK4MEgHc9NL_E6dxEaIyDTDA=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68996280/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_1.50.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="48SGu8"&gt;Intel launched a new ad campaign starring Justin Long, Apple’s “I’m a Mac” actor, but for this campaign, Long is singing the praises of PC laptops and comparing them to MacBooks. The thing is, for reasons that we can’t quite figure out, Intel actually made the MacBook Pros in its commercials look &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than they do in real life, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/my4ZjCUkTsI"&gt;tech YouTuber Rene Ritchie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHxUsS"&gt;Take a look at these two photos. The one on the left is a photo of a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip taken for &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; review. The one on the right is taken from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;this Intel ad&lt;/a&gt;. Can you spot the difference? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gCbYEy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10402291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQAO3Z"&gt;I’ll spoil it for you: Intel’s version of the MacBook Pro has &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; thinner screen bezels, making it a nearly edge-to-edge display. I’d love it if my MacBook’s bezels were this thin! (Though Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro doesn’t have a webcam. Bummer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfrVaf"&gt;But Intel’s fabled all-screen MacBook Pro didn’t make just one appearance. It’s also &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;in this ad&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to ding the MacBook Pro for not being a 2-in-1. Look at that Mac — all screen! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Umm86hxxxDCxyXPZek-082_221Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383686/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.08.32_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="deOxPX"&gt;Intel did confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it used real MacBook Pros with an M1 chip in the commercials, but the company wouldn’t say what it may or may not have changed about them: “With respect to filming and showcasing details, we’re not commenting at this time,” an Intel spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0FVO2"&gt;So what probably happened here is that Intel changed the look of the MacBook Pros’ screens in post-production, which had the happenstance effect of making their screens look better than they do in real life. (And if you look at the image from the second ad, you can see some kind of blackish-haze applied over the screen, which probably wouldn’t be there in reality.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Q96gD"&gt;These ads, in my opinion, are also kind of missing the point. None of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;Intel’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfHplU5fatE"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HebkohrCns"&gt;commercials&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate how Intel’s chips can compete with the MacBook Pro’s real advantage: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s speedy and battery-efficient M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;. (So far, Intel has only produced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272041/intel-apple-macbook-m1-performance-benchmarks-processors"&gt;cherry-picked benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; to try and hit back at the M1.) And by trying to dunk on the MacBook Pro, Intel is also, in a way, dunking on itself, since it still provides chips for some models of the Apple laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1k50q1"&gt;And seriously, doesn’t that all-screen MacBook Pro just look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS developer who drew attention to App Store scams is now suing Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8VOytbQjhwM4pNFyhhTl9_Tr0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986294/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Be9Nie"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;publicly called out Apple earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for negligence with regard to policing iOS scams and copycat apps on the App Store, has filed a lawsuit against the iPhone maker in California. He’s accusing the company of exploiting its monopoly power over iOS apps “to make billions of dollars in profits at the expense of small application developers and consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6IHJA"&gt;Eleftheriou’s company KPAW LLC, which he co-owns with his partner Ashley Eleftheriou, filed its complaint in Santa Clara County on Wednesday. It details the development and release timeline of Eleftheriou’s Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jIZ8V"&gt;At the time he began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;accusing Apple of abetting App Store scams&lt;/a&gt; early last month, Eleftheriou revealed that his FlickType app had been targeted by competing software he says either didn’t work well or didn’t work at all, and yet nonetheless chipped away at this sales and App Store rankings through false advertising and the purchase of fake reviews. After he complained, he said Apple did not do enough to combat the scams, though Apple did later remove some of the apps he called attention to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bTOuKZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The App Store has a big problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.&lt;br&gt;Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/ &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iCwzu7"&gt;Eleftheriou’s claims join a chorus of growing complaints against Apple and the App Store. Some developers, competing tech companies, regulators, and now state lawmakers have accused the mobile marketplace of being a monopoly in software distribution that harms competition and keeps consumers paying higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SngFHz"&gt;Epic Games, the maker of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;targeting both Apple and Google with antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of the battle royale game last summer for use of an alternative in-app payment system. Meanwhile, a group of app makers, ranging from Epic to Spotify to Tinder parent company Match Group, have begun lobbying state lawmakers to take up the fight against the App Store and Google Play Store, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;surprising success so far in Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and numerous other bills around the country in the works, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mff1OQ"&gt;In the complaint, Eleftheriou goes further into detail about what he claims is wrongful behavior from Apple, including alleged false advertising, breach of its developer agreement, and fraud. One notable claim involves Apple trying to acquire FlickType, after which Eleftheriou says he faced “roadblock after roadblock” to selling his software on the App Store. The complaint suggests Apple chose not to take action on scam and copycat apps in an effort to force Eleftheriou to sell his app to Apple. “Evidently, Apple thought Plaintiff would simply give up and sell its application to Apple at a discount,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cakQJk"&gt;At the heart of the dispute appears to be conversations Eleftheriou had with an Apple executive Randy Marsden, who led mobile keyboard technology at the company and later held the position of Text Input Special Projects Manager. Marsden is well known in the tech industry for co-founding the keyboard technology startup Swype, and for later co-founding the app Dryft, which was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/apple-quietly-bought-dryft-a-keyboard-app/"&gt;acquired by Apple in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition resulted in Marsden being put in charge of the iOS keyboard at Apple from 2014 to 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MGygaY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple systematically flexes its monopoly muscle against potential competition through the App Store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8H2CO"&gt;Eleftheriou says he was approached by Marsden, who expressed interest in having Apple acquire his software to improve typing on the Apple Watch. Yet, the negotiations went quiet, and afterward, Eleftheriou claims Apple removed his FlickType keyboard app and refused to approve future versions as well as a note-taking variant, on what he thinks are suspicious grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu2UYd"&gt;Only later did Apple permit both apps after months of appeals and after Eleftheriou let countless other app makers integrate his technology. Those apps using the FlickType tech were approved without issue, the complaint says. Meanwhile, many other wearable and mobile keyboard apps Eleftheriou characterizes as scams were also approved and allowed on the App Store. “By this time, Apple’s wrongful rejections had already cost Plaintiff over a year of revenue,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="462hBJ"&gt;Eleftheriou’s complaint says this is evidence of Apple “flexing its monopoly muscle against potential competition”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="z21d1N"&gt;Apple entices software application developers like Plaintiff to develop innovative applications with the promise of a fair and secure App Store in which to sell them. In truth, Apple systematically flexes its monopoly muscle against potential competition through the App Store and profits from rampant fraudulent practices. If Apple cannot buy a desired application from a developer on the cheap, Apple attempts to crush that developer through exploitive fees and selective application of opaque and unreasonable constraints against the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXDx4A"&gt; At the same time, Apple permits other developers that Apple does not view as real competition, including scam competitors, to peddle similar, inferior products because Apple profits from their sales. Scammers oftentimes use screenshots and videos taken from legitimate developer’s applications and manipulate their ratings. Apple does little to police these practices because it profits from them. Apple then lies to its regulators by asserting that it must maintain its monopoly power over the sale of Apple-related applications to protect consumers, when, in fact, Apple lets them get ripped off and exploits the developers trying to deliver innovation to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="A9h9uq"&gt;Eleftheriou says even after his app became the No. 1 paid app on the App Store after it was approved, earning him $130,000 in its first month of release, he had to face down a wave of scam apps and copycat software that targeted FlickType after its visible success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiHVGV"&gt;“Despite possessing massive resources and technological savvy, Apple intentionally fails to police these fraudsters, costing honest developers millions, and perhaps billions, while Apple continues to amass huge profits for itself,” the complaint reads. “Apple holds both its device users and developers hostage. Yet each time it faces antitrust claims, Apple justifies its monopoly by claiming it is necessary to protect its users and developers from unscrupulous conduct and ensure a fair competitive marketplace for the benefit of both. In truth, Apple turns a blind eye to rampant fraud and exploitation to make an easy profit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZuPiN"&gt;Eleftheriou is accusing Apple of false advertising, unfair competition in violation of California’s business and professions code, breach of good faith and fair dealing with regard to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, fraud, and negligence and negligent misrepresentation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New iPad Pros reportedly launching as soon as April, and the 12.9-inch model may have a Mini LED screen</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8N0Nkk"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning a number of updates to its iPad line, including new iPad Pros launching as soon as April, a new iPad mini with a larger screen, and a refresh of the base iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jY2HJg"&gt;The new iPad Pros are expected to have a similar design as the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;released last March&lt;/a&gt; but have a better processor that’s “on par” with the speedy M1 chip in Apple’s newest MacBook Airs, Pros, and Mac mini, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. Both models may also have improved cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlPrXy"&gt;The 12.9-inch iPad Pro could have a Mini LED screen, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, which should offer a higher contrast ratio and be less susceptible to burn-in than OLED screens.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Hours after the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report, reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo added credence to the claim saying Apple would begin mass production of Mini LED iPads in “&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/"&gt;mid to late April&lt;/a&gt;,” as reported by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;. Kuo has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/2/20992125/apple-mini-led-ipad-macbook-pro-2020-oled-rumor-kuo"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has Mini LED-equipped tablets and laptops in the works, and said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s first device with the new screen technology would be a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Kuo’s latest research note issued today said that he expects a Mini LED MacBook Air by 2022 while cheaper iPads, like the iPad Air, will switch to OLED displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJV9Eq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple has tested its new iPad Pros with a Thunderbolt port, which would be able to transfer data faster than the USB-C port found on the iPad Pros right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LmFil"&gt;In addition to the new iPad Pros, Apple is also working on an iPad mini update with a screen that’s larger than the 7.9-inch display currently used on the company’s smallest tablet, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Apple last refreshed the iPad mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after not updating the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/28/9409015/apple-ipad-mini-4-review-2015"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The new iPad mini could launch as soon as this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNFwec"&gt;Apple is also planning to update its cheapest iPad with a new design that’s thinner and lighter at some point this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. Apple last refreshed the base iPad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUSE54"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 5:10AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comments from Ming-Chi Kuo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. If you don’t mind buying refurbished, you can grab a refurbished pair for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the AirPods Pros are currently $219 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37HKT8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K387Y7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, have knocked $30 off its price as well, bringing it down to $199. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V9q5MF"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 5 was released in 2019 and was discontinued roughly a year after release once the Series 6 was announced. Similar to its successor, the Series 5 includes an always-on display, unlike the Apple Watch SE. It also includes the ability to take EKGs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $400 if you buy it in gold&lt;/a&gt; (in stock on March 24th), which is $29 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted at Amazon; you can get this model for $680 ($69 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FTH75?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FVJMX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="XeRDay"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration on sale for $849&lt;/a&gt;. You can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0863BT4DD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for $1,049&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon in space gray. Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,249 in space gray;&lt;/a&gt; that’s $50 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $949&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage. If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $999&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,199&lt;/a&gt;. The 12.9-inch 1TB model with Wi-Fi only is also discounted at Amazon. You can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08631SHQJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399&lt;/a&gt; in both colors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel puts Apple’s ‘I’m a Mac’ guy into new ads praising PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uLT12mJPm7oEwJ0bBp5O7qEk-1o=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980460/LDTTUmg.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMO1fM"&gt;Intel has hired Apple’s former “I’m a Mac” actor Justin Long to create new ads praising PCs. Long starts each commercial with “Hello I’m a... Justin,” with the typical white background you’d find on Apple’s Mac vs. PC ads from the 2000s. Naturally, the ads focus on Mac vs. PC again, with Long mocking Apple’s Touch Bar, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WfHplU5fatE"&gt;lack of M1 multiple monitor support&lt;/a&gt;, and the “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;gray and grayer&lt;/a&gt;” color choices for a MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0THmCs"&gt;One even &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;goes all-in&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s lack of touchscreens in Macs or 2-in-1 support by mocking the fact you have to buy a tablet, keyboard, stylus, and even a dongle to match what’s available on rival Intel-based laptops. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8HebkohrCns"&gt;Another ad&lt;/a&gt; also points out that “no one really games on a Mac.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PaSRqw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gtRRMd2_UI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X5HdBA"&gt;The return of Justin Long in Mac vs. PC ads for Intel comes just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558977/apple-pc-guy-classic-m1-performance-john-hodgman"&gt;Apple brought back actor John Hodgman&lt;/a&gt; to reprise his role as the PC guy from Apple’s “I’m a Mac, and I’m a PC” ad campaign. While Apple kept its reprisal limited to the company’s keynote to introduce Arm-based M1 MacBooks, Intel has gone a step further and revived this for full commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GidON"&gt;Intel is clearly ready to battle Apple’s first chips with marketing, but we’re still waiting for the company to respond with its own silicon advances. Intel has only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272041/intel-apple-macbook-m1-performance-benchmarks-processors"&gt;produced benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; so far. Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has also already made it clear that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232554/intel-ceo-apple-lifestyle-company-cpus-comment"&gt;Intel has to beat Apple in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just gave Russia a spot on the iPhone to advertise its favorite apps to its citizens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pM2WG3NS0H7dkbe0LJ91Bm-c8cQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68978734/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NkHvcU"&gt;Starting April 1st, users setting up a new iPhone in Russia will see a screen that allows them to automatically install apps that are officially sanctioned by the Russian government, in compliance with Russian law (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-ipad-mac-russia-apps-preinstall-144255015.html"&gt;via Engadget&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptFlOo"&gt;The law in question &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;was passed back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and requires smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and smart TVs sold in Russia to come pre-installed with specific apps made by Russian companies by April 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2021/03/15/861564-iphone-soft"&gt;according to Russian news site &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (The law was originally set to go into effect in July 2020, but was pushed back to April 2021). &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt; also says that apps won’t be installed if users don’t want them. Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will comply with the law by giving the users the option to install the apps when activating the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRBCqS"&gt;Which apps are specifically going to be offered to users remains unclear, though &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt; cites a government services app, and apps from Russian companies including Yandex, Mail.ru, and Kaspersky Lab. The government seems to be aware that it might be problematic to favor specific apps, and is planning to expand its list over time: “The Ministry is not at all interested in seeing popular apps included in the mandatory pre-installation list take dominant positions. If alternatives emerge on the market, prove interesting to users and gain popularity quickly, they will be included in this selection and also offered for pre-installation,” a Russian official told &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DEOsL"&gt;Apple has historically kept tight control over the iPhone’s setup process, and that appears to now be changing, if only in one market. While Apple has previously made changes to stay on the side of local laws — it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985762/apple-maps-weather-apps-crimea-russia-territory"&gt;changed maps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17803638/apple-watch-pride-face-russia-block"&gt;blocked pride watch faces&lt;/a&gt; in Russia, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;now stores iCloud data on state-run servers in China&lt;/a&gt; — this may be one of the more dramatic changes, as it affects a screen that every user will see when they set up their iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOLofx"&gt;Apple has slowly been allowing users to change how iOS works out of the box, with the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21301478/apple-ios-14-default-apps-browser-email-changes-features-report"&gt;change some default apps in iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;, but now it’s given a small amount of control over the setup process to the Russian government, too. As the company faces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;legal challenges from the EU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/17/21292983/apple-spotify-antitrust-hey-email-congress-house-judiciary-tim-cook"&gt;US over antitrust&lt;/a&gt;, and over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;giving its competitors a level playing field&lt;/a&gt;, we may see Apple having to give over some more control to governments if it wants to sell its phones to their citizens — though it probably won’t be compelled to ask users if they want to install Spotify at setup. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
