    <title>Apple’s $19 polishing cloth is back in stock online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BFtKsVDD9wBdeVm05pluPcOn08=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375574/MM6F3_AV2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy the cloth once again.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGwWdl"&gt;Apple’s $19 polishing cloth is back in stock &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth"&gt;at the company’s online store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/the-nightmare-is-over-the-apple-polishing-cloth-is-back-in-stock-and-ready-to-ship/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The very expensive piece of cloth was first introduced following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;Apple’s October event&lt;/a&gt;, but it was quickly backordered — &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/11/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was “impossible” to get one before the holidays — so if you’ve been waiting to get one, now’s your chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIrJTx"&gt;“Made with soft, nonabrasive material, the Polishing Cloth cleans any Apple display, including nano-texture glass, safely and effectively,” reads Apple’s description of the cloth on its product page. Sounds perfect if you need to clean a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161487/apple-mac-pro-display-xdr-review-6k-lcd-screen-price-features"&gt;Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt; with the nano-texture glass screen. That already costs $5,999 — the nano-texture glass is a $1,000 upgrade from the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/pro-display-xdr"&gt;standard model&lt;/a&gt; — and if you want Apple’s official stand for the display, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/3/18651001/apples-mac-pro-xdr-display-monitor-stand-expensive-dongle-not-included-wwdc-2019"&gt;you’ll have to drop an additional grand&lt;/a&gt;, so what’s another $19 for the company’s polishing cloth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StcXNF"&gt;It appears that the cloth isn’t in stock at the company’s retail stores; it isn’t available for in-store pickup at any of the stores near me. If you order one as I write this, though, Apple says it will be delivered by Friday. While you’re waiting for your order to arrive, don’t miss &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54122%2Fmacbook-pro-2021-teardown%23cloth&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F11%2F22878673%2Fapple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit’s actual teardown of the cloth&lt;/a&gt; — which is actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753184/ifixit-apple-polishing-cloth-19-repair-backorder"&gt;more interesting than you might expect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The excellent Beats Fit Pro earbuds are coming to many more countries on January 28th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ayG7Wf6Tozvi1zlC44rD7MSdLg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375456/DSCF6033_Edited.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIDPIb"&gt;Beats’ best earbuds yet, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt;, were only available in the United States immediately upon their release a few months ago. Apple then launched the earbuds in China, but now they’re set to become much more widely available on January 28th. That’s when the Beats Fit Pro will launch across Canada, Europe, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV04z1"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beatsbydre/status/1480947737118101506"&gt;a tweet from the Apple-owned brand&lt;/a&gt;, preorders for the “worldwide” release will begin on January 24th before the buds hit shelves on the 28th. The Beats Fit Pro include flexible wingtips that help them (comfortably) stay anchored in your ears without coming loose — even during exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaoI5x"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-canada-europe-japan-release-date-161335850.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in Europe the Beats Fit Pro will be priced at £200 / €230; in Canada they’ll cost $250 CAD; and in Japan you’ll be able to get them for 24,800 yen. As in the US, the Fit Pro earbuds will be offered in black, white, gray, and purple. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptNyqVVjvt3IM3On3kkY-q2tLvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973260/DSCF6027_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds are basically a sportier version of the AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OYFwzG"&gt;They feature the same active noise cancellation system as the AirPods Pro, IPX4 water resistance, and also support head tracking when listening to spatial audio. Battery life is rated at up to six hours on a charge, with the case good for another 21 hours. They don’t check off all the bells and whistles: there’s no wireless charging, for example, and AirPods still perform better on voice calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tG3gc5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Beats Fit Pro review: sporty AirPods Pros with better sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gLqzYG"&gt;But they maintain most of Apple’s ecosystem tricks while delivering arguably better, more powerful sound in a fit that offers superior stability. They’re our top pick for workout earbuds, but I find myself using them just as regularly for everyday listening.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple promises third-party payment options in iOS for South Korean users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQJQNIA8NaFSDyGKzKg3lYPgVCM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373581/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="20az7S"&gt;Apple says it will introduce third-party payment options for the first time ever in iOS apps,  following South Korean legislation designed to open up the perceived monopolies of Google and Apple’s app stores. The alternative payments will only be available in South Korea and follows the announcement of similar changes by Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments"&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QknUEg"&gt;Apple’s decision was shared by the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) and reported by &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20220111004700320?input=tw"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News Agency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but details of the implementation are thin on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pFNs7Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arguments over payment fees triggered the Epic Games trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0W7ewy"&gt;Apple currently charges developers a 30 percent fee on any digital purchases made by consumers using iOS apps. This fee has become increasingly contentious for developers, and was at the heart of the huge US lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;between Apple and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the lawsuit, a judge ordered Apple to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;allow third-party payments&lt;/a&gt; in the App Store, but this order was later put on hold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;due to an appeal&lt;/a&gt;. (Apple has since made a tiny concession to “reader apps” like Netflix, allowing them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;link to websites to sign up users for new accounts&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s nothing like allowing in-app third-party payments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOsnAI"&gt;In South Korea, lawmakers have upheld complaints by developers about in-app payments, leading to new legislation. Apple says its will charge developers a reduced fee to use third-party payment options (just as Google has promised for its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments"&gt;third-party payment support&lt;/a&gt;), but some developers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1480807630817878020"&gt;say it’s unfair&lt;/a&gt; for these companies to charge any fee at all. Apple and Google say fees are necessary to maintain and promote their app platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43SzGz"&gt;Apple has not said how much it will charge developers to implement third-party payments in South Korea, or when this option will be available, or how exactly these new payments will be made available to consumers. The exact details of the implementation will be vitally important, as seemingly small decisions in things like app store UI can be used to steer consumers one way or another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PU1Ya1"&gt;“Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea’s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country’s talented app developers. Our work will always be guided by keeping the App Store a safe and trusted place for our users to download the apps they love,” Apple told &lt;em&gt;Yonhap &lt;/em&gt;in a press statement. “We look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google exec says Apple is ‘holding back’ customers who text</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4LltNBE5S-g1C6kXU8Tt28q8GVI=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372410/vpavic_190508_3403_0377.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ubml4b"&gt;On Saturday, Android boss Hiroshi Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876067/google-apple-ios-android-imessages-bullying-lockheimer"&gt;accused Apple of “using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products&lt;/a&gt;,” after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; revealed how US teens have turned Apple’s iMessage into a social status symbol that locks Android users out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6YMP"&gt;Now, Lockheimer is taking a slightly less abrasive stance: the Google executive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777"&gt;said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that “we’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hhiPL1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.&lt;/p&gt;— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alkhQP"&gt;“By not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663659135176705"&gt;adds Lockheimer&lt;/a&gt;, later in the Twitter thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgvZlc"&gt;That’s still a big accusation, but one that pulls the conversation back into familiar territory: will Apple &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1446193676883922953%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22715696%2Fsvp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;accept Google’s olive branch&lt;/a&gt; to make iMessage more compatible with Android, or will it continue to use lock-in to sell more iPhones? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOt9Oq"&gt;On the lock-in front, there’s little question about Apple’s motivation. Thanks to the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the world has now seen confidential emails&lt;/a&gt; between Apple executives that show  the company is intentionally withholding iMessage in favor of lock-in. “I am concerned the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043920-2013-april-federighi-and-schiller-tell-cue-not-to-bring-imessage-to-android-lockin/#document/p2"&gt;wrote Apple exec Craig Federighi in April 2013&lt;/a&gt;, adding “I think we need to get Android customers using and dependent on Apple products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWOCzA"&gt;“Joz and I think moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043935-2016-march-phil-schiller-why-imessage-lockin-is-important/#document/p1"&gt;wrote Apple’s Phil Schiller in March 2016&lt;/a&gt;, forwarding an email from Beats Music co-founder Ian Rogers about how he “missed a ton of messages from friends and family” after switching to an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCGNOG"&gt;What’s less clear is whether RCS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"&gt;the next-gen replacement for SMS that’s championed by Google&lt;/a&gt; and incorporates popular features common to iMessage, has any convincing reason for Apple to sign on. That’s likely why Google is creating a little peer pressure of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6U1Fmm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Let’s chat about RCS","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"},{"title":"The moral case for iMessage on Android","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"},{"title":"Why I turned on iMessage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nMgnBN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has asked Apple if it intends to support RCS &lt;em&gt;literally years &lt;/em&gt;with no comment&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re not holding our breath. We’ve also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"&gt;the moral case&lt;/a&gt; that a company that claims privacy is a human right has a duty to bring encrypted messaging to the world, not just its own customers, and we’ve written about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"&gt;the personal plight of dealing with Apple’s inaction&lt;/a&gt;. (And when I say “we”, I mean Dieter, because RCS is his jam, I’m writing this post because he’s on vacation, and Dieter srsly why are you reading these words, aren’t you supposed to be on a socially distanced beach somewhere?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvKptQ"&gt;But maybe now that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22828277/apple-3-trillion-market-cap-company-earnings"&gt;is basically a three-trillion dollar company&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s under loads of regulatory scrutiny, and its dirty laundry (in the form of emails) has been aired in front of the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic"&gt;its employees are speaking out&lt;/a&gt;, and pieces like the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; are coming out, and its CEO Tim Cook is likely looking for a legacy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;larger than simply scaling up the company&lt;/a&gt; to become the most valuable in the world with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871202/tim-cook-2021-pay-package-compensation-proxy"&gt;a fat pay package&lt;/a&gt; as the reward... perhaps bringing iMessage to Android or RCS to iMessage is the kind of small concession that Apple might actually make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrmWgg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 7:48PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Dieter informs me Apple did actually reply to our requests for comment on RCS. Their reply was “No comment.” I regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile appears to be blocking some iPhone users from enabling iCloud Private Relay, a feature that lets you hide the websites you visit from third parties, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/t-mobile-block-icloud-private-relay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The block doesn’t appear to be malicious, however — without it, some T-Mobile services couldn’t operate, &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwCA9M"&gt;Private Relay is still in beta in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and it isn’t turned on by default. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;You have to go into your iPhone’s settings to switch it on&lt;/a&gt;, which is where some T-Mobile customers have noticed a strange message popping up. As shown in the above tweet, the user is presented with the message, “Your cellular plan doesn’t support iCloud Private Relay. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z095du"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480631410239094797?s=20"&gt;a reply to that tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the user shows what happens when you click the “Learn More” button below the initial message — there, Apple explains why T-Mobile might be blocking the feature. “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay,” it reads. “Your cellular provider may be providing network-based services, such as Parental Controls, requiring them to view the traffic on your network.” An &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;internal note shared with &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggests that’s exactly what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oYDJF"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report, &lt;/em&gt;iCloud Private Relay conflicts with a number of T-Mobile services. Notably, Private Relay conflicts with T-Mobile customers using Web Guard, and Sprint and Home Office Internet customers who enable content filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4ZROa"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/european-carriers-seek-to-block-iphone-private-relay-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iPhone users in Europe were the first to notice that access to the Private Relay feature had been blocked. T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica added their names to an open letter published in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F10%2F22877211%2Ft-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that criticizes the feature. Carriers argue that Private Relay “will impair others to innovate and compete in downstream digital markets and may negatively impact operators’ ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7LADr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to T-Mobile and Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is the latest popular app to bail on the Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tO0RhQCW8p8IiZWXBtxzHJEPm4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371662/DSCF7013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XGd3fO"&gt;Uber has quietly shut down its Apple Watch app, with the software now showing a message that instructs people to “please switch to the Uber mobile app.” The company is “no longer supporting the Apple Watch app,” according to the text, which ends with Uber apologizing for any inconvenience caused by the app’s discontinuation. There’s also a sad face emoji to drive that sentiment home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJRJLv"&gt;As noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/uber-apple-watch-app-discontinued/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Uber hasn’t yet removed the Apple Watch app from its &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uber-request-a-ride/id368677368"&gt;App Store listing&lt;/a&gt;, where it still gets its own tab and screenshots. Presumably, that will all be history once the company releases its next update to the iOS app. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Uber for more details, and if I had to guess, the company is likely to cite low usage as the main reason for its Apple Watch exit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HdCfqjmn-JlpSN4rJ-ePN6taq4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159195/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.42.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Uber&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uber’s Apple Watch app offered basic ride-hailing functionality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scOYWz"&gt;On the one hand, this is another example of smartwatches continuing to shed apps — even those that are massively popular and borderline essential on a phone — that aren’t core to their purpose(s) of fitness tracking, notifications, music playback, and so on. I’ve long had Uber installed on my Apple Watch, and I don’t think there was a single occasion where I hailed a ride from my wrist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys7XYG"&gt;Uber ended support for its WearOS app more than two years ago, so it’s not like Google’s platform fared much better with user engagement. Lyft has been out of this game since 2018. Perhaps it’s a case where the form factor just isn’t the right match for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48SE9i"&gt;The Apple Watch app provided barebones ride-hailing functionality, with more advanced options like splitting fares and sharing an ETA reserved for the full mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jT3X_bQX7t5a0-1eIimEZhvSoS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159213/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.47.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has previously highlighted Uber for the Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gcFfKc"&gt;But it also goes to show that, in some ways, smartwatches are only moving further away from being able to serve as a standalone smartphone fill-in — even temporarily. Maybe barely anyone took advantage of Uber on the Apple Watch, but the fact that it no longer exists on the platform at all feels notable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfDX8y"&gt;Want to leave your phone at home for the day and rely on your cellular Apple Watch? You can’t hail an Uber in that scenario anymore. And it’s a use case that Apple itself once highlighted, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIWlc8"&gt;Uber continues to offer its primary app for iPhone and a larger version for the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wrZNHQuybPnb7flbGQn29kCJWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371019/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4MqeMB"&gt;App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion since the store launched in 2008, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-services-enrich-peoples-lives-throughout-the-year/"&gt;according to a Monday press release from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-services-entertain-inform-and-connect-the-world-in-unprecedented-year/"&gt;last January&lt;/a&gt; that developers had earned more than $200 billion since the launch of the App Store, so the new figure shared Monday indicates developers earned $60 billion in 2021. The iPhone maker also said that spending on the App Store between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve in 2021 grew by a double-digit amount, though it didn’t specify exactly what that number might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yzhint"&gt;While the new numbers suggest that the App Store continues to be a big moneymaker, developer unhappiness with the store is high at the current moment. Many developers have taken issue with what they see as restrictive store policies, particularly the 30 percent cut Apple takes from many transactions. Apple is still embroiled in a legal dispute with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games over the App Store, and although Apple arguably got off well from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ruling&lt;/a&gt;, that ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;has been put on hold&lt;/a&gt;, meaning Apple won’t have to let developers point customers to alternative payment systems outside the App Store for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="758qDc"&gt;Monday’s press release also included a stat first shared &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/10/31/apple-q4-2021-financials-apple-music-paying-subs/"&gt;during its October earnings&lt;/a&gt;: there are more than 745 million paid subscriptions to services from developers and Apple. In recent years, Apple has added new premium services like News Plus, Fitness Plus, and Apple TV Plus to its roster of services offerings. The strategy seems to be paying off, given the new all-time high for services revenue reported during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;October earnings&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear how many subscriptions to Apple’s own services are counted in that 745 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAfjsi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, January 10th, 6:19PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The 745 million paid subscriptions to services includes subscriptions to both developers and Apple, not just Apple, as we originally reported. That number was also shared in its October earnings, not first on Monday as we said. We regret the errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly discontinues the Beats Pill Plus, its last battery-powered speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuIZuyAmqkYZ9OSgp0aZ8TD96Ds=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370987/beats-pill-plus-0797.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zPdmTY"&gt;Apple appears to have quietly discontinued the Beats Pill Plus, with the portable wireless speaker no longer appearing on either Apple or Beats’ websites, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/apple-discontinues-beats-pill-plus/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPABjh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467123/beats-pill-plus-speaker-apple-dre"&gt;Originally released in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the Pill Plus was the first speaker released under the Beats brand since the music company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5700530/apple-confirms-beats-acquisition"&gt;purchased by Apple for $3 billion back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. A more refined version of the original Beats Pill speaker, the Pill Plus was an Apple-ified version of the original product, with sleeker monochromatic color options and the addition of a Lightning port for charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oXUrI7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Beats’ Pill+ is its best speaker ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467123/beats-pill-plus-speaker-apple-dre"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ccL1KU"&gt;Apple and Beats would continue to go on to build out Beats’ lineup of headphones over the intervening half-decade, with products like recent Beats Fit Pro or Powerbeats earbuds, both of which feature the same H1 chips and software integration as the Apple-branded AirPods lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxY13c"&gt;But the company didn’t show the same love to the Pill line. There was no Pill Plus successor that added support for Apple’s AirPlay standard or one with integrated Siri support. In fact, Apple hasn’t released another portable speaker (under either its Apple &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; its Beats brands), despite its expansion into smart home speakers with the since-discontinued HomePod and the smaller HomePod mini — the sole standalone speaker that Apple currently sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABTA5K"&gt;In the meantime, plenty of other portable battery-powered speakers around have come out to fill the niche that Apple never really explored with its Beats-branded options. There’s the Sonos Roam, which offers both Bluetooth and works with Apple’s AirPlay 2 standard, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/30/17796756/ue-ultimate-ears-boom-3-megaboom-speakers-wireless-bluetooth-price-ifa-2018"&gt;modernized versions of the Ultimate Ears speakers&lt;/a&gt; that the Beats Pill Plus used to compete with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJMmaL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIUeqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 8 may not have a body temperature sensor after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The screen is 20 percent larger on the Apple Watch Series 7" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDkDzzOZvg3BIpaWTSWwvJu1eow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370410/vpavic_211006_4796_0039.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series 7’s big update was a larger screen, which some found disappointing.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SqtZvC"&gt;If you were hoping for more exciting updates with the Apple Watch Series 8, you might have to start tempering expectations. While it was initially thought that the next-generation watch would have a body temperature sensor, it’s looking like that may not be the case after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVGhLU"&gt;A body temperature sensor for the Series 8 has been heavily rumored for some time now. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman — who has a pretty good track record when it comes to Apple rumors — first hinted &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;a body temperature sensor was coming&lt;/a&gt; in June. That was echoed by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; in September for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201#refreshed?mod=latest_headlines"&gt;a potential fertility feature&lt;/a&gt;. Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/apple-watch-series-8-thermometer/"&gt;predicted a body temperature sensor&lt;/a&gt; that same month. All in all, there have been several solid reasons to believe this was in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ariKjy"&gt;However, in his latest &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Gurman has backtracked. When speaking about the Series 8’s potential for body temperature sensing, blood glucose monitoring, and blood pressure capabilities, Gurman wrote, “Don’t expect any of these soon, though. Body temperature was on this year’s roadmap, but chatter about it has slowed down recently. Blood pressure is at least two to three years away, while I wouldn’t be surprised if glucose monitoring doesn’t land until later in the second half of the decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLqx2T"&gt;For blood pressure and blood glucose, this makes a lot of sense. While there’s been a lot of headway in noninvasive, cuffless blood pressure monitoring in wearables, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677381/smartwatch-blood-pressure-samsung-fitbit-apple"&gt;the technology simply isn’t there yet&lt;/a&gt;. The same applies to blood glucose monitoring. Although the feature was &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rumor-has-it-the-next-samsung-apple-smartwatches-might-1846124296"&gt;rumored for the Series 7 and in Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;, it never materialized. The tech does exist in a nascent form — a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-are-the-wearables-that-stood-out-at-ces-2021-1846053707?rev=1610579714156"&gt;prototype from Japanese startup Quantum Operation&lt;/a&gt; was featured at CES 2021 — but it’s nowhere near ready for consumer-grade devices. Of the rumored features, body temperature sensors seemed most likely as they’re already available in several other consumer wearables, including those from rivals like Fitbit. In fact, body temperature sensors in wearables gained a lot of attention in 2020, when researchers used them to try to determine whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535204/apple-watch-fitbit-oura-wearables-illness-prediction"&gt;smartwatches could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/can-a-smart-watch-detect-covid-19-1833409102"&gt;detect COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QjT3c"&gt;Currently, body temperature sensors are mostly used for sleep and recovery tracking, though &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-this-fertility-apps-first-scientific-study-is-so-ex-1834849462"&gt;fertility wearables like Ava&lt;/a&gt; may also feature them. While Apple has added sleep and period tracking in the past few years, they’re on the simpler side. Adding a body temperature sensor would potentially help level up these particular features, especially if the company is planning on adding fertility-related features as reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. However, Apple is notorious for sitting on features other device makers have already implemented until it’s happy with its own version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5M4RI"&gt;“Chatter slowing down,” as Gurman puts it, doesn’t mean a body temperature feature is completely dead. However, it does bring up another point: perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect Apple to introduce a new groundbreaking, industry-leading feature every year on its smartwatch. It’s true that since the Series 3, Apple has outpaced the competition when it came to advanced smartwatch capabilities. The Series 3 introduced cellular, the Series 4 changed the design and added FDA-cleared EKGs, the Series 5 added an always-on display, and the Series 6 added a SpO2 (blood oxygen) sensor. However, the additions have been less buzz-worthy starting with the Series 6. Not only have SpO2 sensors been on smartwatches since 2017, but the Series 7’s marquee feature was also just a larger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id9Von"&gt;Right now, the Apple Watch is the &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/524806/global-smartwatch-vendor-shipments/"&gt;most popular smartwatch on the market&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple has a yearslong lead on the competition. Wear OS watches are amid a complicated transition to a new unified platform with Samsung. Fitbit and Garmin may have advanced health features and better battery, but they both lag in smart features like cellular connectivity. Samsung comes closest, but many of its health and fitness features aren’t quite as polished.  Technically speaking, there’s no &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for Apple at the moment to dramatically shake things up in the short term — especially as it’s already investing resources in more groundbreaking health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lYak6"&gt;Advanced health features, especially nascent ones like noninvasive blood pressure and blood glucose, will take a while before they’re ready for consumer use. And even when they are “ready,” they’ll probably have to go through the FDA clearance process. In the meantime, it’s more than likely that future Apple Watch updates will focus more on design, incremental hardware upgrades, and software updates that make use of existing sensors. Case in point: Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;also forecasted&lt;/a&gt; the Series 8 would see a rugged sports version and a new entry-level model. That said, perhaps we’d all settle down if Apple could finally figure out how to include multiday battery life. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says Apple ‘should not benefit from bullying’ created by iMessage lock-in</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yY1j6X"&gt;Google has accused Apple of benefiting from bullying as part of a deliberate strategy to make Android users into second-class citizens on the iPhone-maker’s iMessage service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvJ9pO"&gt;Apple’s messaging service includes a number of iOS-exclusive features, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17506010/apple-ios-12-imessage-how-to-make-memoji"&gt;Memoji&lt;/a&gt;, and famously turns texts from Android users green instead of the iOS-native blue. This has turned iMessage into a status symbol among US teens, creating peer pressure for young people to buy iPhones and sometimes leading to the ostracization of Android users. Showing up in a group chat as a green bubble has become, for some, a social faux pas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL5hng"&gt;A recent report in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlighted this dynamic and prompted a response from both the Android team and Google’s head of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvidSI"&gt;“iMessage should not benefit from bullying. Texting should bring us together, and the solution exists. Let’s fix this as one industry,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Android/status/1479875457667448837"&gt;tweeted the official Android account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgwqNp"&gt;Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1479865157753147395"&gt;was more strident&lt;/a&gt;: “Apple’s iMessage lock-in is a documented strategy. Using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products is disingenuous for a company that has humanity and equity as a core part of its marketing. The standards exist today to fix this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aWzMmN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple says making iMessage available on Android would “hurt us more than help us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MtlNIi"&gt;Although Apple’s iMessage strategy has long been apparent, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;internal emails sent by company executives&lt;/a&gt; that were surfaced during the recent Epic Games trial confirmed the conscious importance of this strategy. Apple did consider making iMessage available on Android to attract more users, but concluded that doing so would “hurt us more than help us” (in the words of Apple exec Phil Schiller). As another executive, Craig Federighi, put it: “iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gWXGj"&gt;Google’s intervention here is not purely altruistic, of course: the company would benefit hugely from Apple making iMessage available on Android. Google has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;recently been pushing&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone-maker to support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681573/google-rcs-chat-android-texting-carriers-imessage-encryption"&gt;next-generation texting standard RCS&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended to replace SMS and has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs"&gt;gathered support&lt;/a&gt; from major US carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBsMkZ"&gt;Google is also not well-placed to criticize other companies messaging strategies. As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; editor Ron Amadeo &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ronamadeo/status/1480025128763371523"&gt;noted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the search giant is notoriously dysfunctional when it comes to messaging, and has launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;13 separate messaging apps&lt;/a&gt; since iMessage came out in 2011 (most of which have failed).&lt;/p&gt;
