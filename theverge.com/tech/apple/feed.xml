    <title>The search is over: smart trackers from Apple, Samsung, and Tile compared</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s never been easier to keep track of your keys&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Yn4hTB"&gt;This year will go down in history as the year we entered the golden age of Not Losing Your Stuff. Well, in addition to some other historic milestones, somewhere in the top 100 hits of the year will be the introduction of smart tracker tags from two major mobile device manufacturers: Samsung and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LL5zg"&gt;Tracking tags have been around for a while now, and Tile has been the best-known brand in the space. With new options from the two most popular US phone manufacturers entering the picture, tracking tags may be poised to go mainstream. If you’re thinking of picking one up but unsure where to start, then you’re in the right place. We tried out three top tracking tags — the Samsung SmartTag Plus, Apple AirTag, and Tile Pro — to see how they compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXXOP8"&gt;First, a word about the very real privacy concerns about these tracking devices. Since their introduction, critics have noted that they could all too easily be used as tools for stalkers, since they’re easy to hide in someone’s bag or car. These concerns were amplified when Apple’s AirTags arrived, given how ubiquitous Apple’s Find My network is. Apple built in certain anti-stalking safety measures at launch, but &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-thing-about-apples-airtags-is-also-the-scaries-1846786338"&gt;reporters quickly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/05/apple-airtags-stalking/"&gt;identified ways&lt;/a&gt; that these safeguards fell short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CXhCa4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With new options from the two most popular US phone manufacturers, tracking tags may be poised to go mainstream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2AwmYL"&gt;The company has addressed some issues, like shortening the length of time before an AirTag will sound an alert when it’s separated from its owner, and is working on an app that will allow Android users to find unwanted AirTags near them. But some potential for misuse will remain even with more safety measures in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="au3ILG"&gt;Apple (justifiably) attracts more scrutiny for its safety practices given the size and effectiveness of its tracking network, but it’s hardly alone in its somewhat reactive attitude toward stalking concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22392924/samsung-smartags-tracker-bixby-privacy-smartthings"&gt;Samsung introduced a SmartThings app feature&lt;/a&gt; that scans for unfamiliar SmartTags, and Tile says it’s working on a similar feature. It doesn’t help that these devices more or less live inside their own manufacturer’s walled garden — a unified, cross-platform approach is sorely needed. Anyway, it’s illegal (and highly immoral) to track someone without their knowledge, so don’t do it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayjCuN"&gt;Per usual, adding new tech to your life involves more terms and conditions to agree to. However, in this case you may have already accepted them when you set up your Apple or Samsung phone. Tile’s app, which you must download to use the Pro, presents its own separate set of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-us%2Fterms-of-service&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfRRvwHF0x2ZIq0H7G1fIytsSkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702210/ajohnson_210702_4659_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile has been the best-known brand in the tracking tag space until now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vB8PcA"&gt;Personal trackers are nothing new — GPS and cellular options have been around for quite some time, and offer more precise, real-time location tracking. They also tend to come with a higher price tag, recurring subscription or wireless data fees, and require more battery power. This newer class of Bluetooth trackers are more practical for most people, with battery life measured in months rather than days and smaller, keyring-friendly form factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhiUx0"&gt;Essentially, the three tags compared here all do the same thing. Pair it to your phone, attach it to something you want to keep track of, and you’re ready to go. When the tracker is within Bluetooth range of your phone, you can have the tag play a sound to help locate it. All three devices support out-of-range finding with their own particular device user networks, and they all include the same kind of user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlEXn2"&gt;Their main difference is whether or not they include AR-assisted finding by way of Ultra Wideband (UWB) connectivity: the Samsung and Apple tags have this and the Tile Pro does not. To take advantage of the AR feature, you’ll need a phone with UWB; on the Apple side that’s an iPhone 11 or newer, and for Samsung it’s a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, Z Fold 2, S21 Plus, or S21 Ultra. There are also compatibility differences: Apple’s tracker only works with iOS devices and Samsung’s only works with Galaxy devices (no, you can’t register it through the SmartThings iOS app, I tried), whereas Tile works on both iOS and Android.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMzWKLcxkNQ7oNoAy-D1TFh941U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702209/ajohnson_210702_4659_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTag is the least expensive of the bunch, but without a built-in keyring hole you may need to buy a holder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KkUjYi"&gt;Apple AirTag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="K8LyRt"&gt;The AirTag comes in just one flavor: a small, $29 disc shape. It’s the only one of the three to include an official IP67 rating, meaning it can survive a dunk in a bit of water. It also allows you to store your contact information so it can be read by any phone with NFC (near-field communication) — even Android phones. Setup is dead simple — just bring the tag near your iPhone and you’ll be prompted to pair the two. It’s also a little less expensive than the other two, but there’s no hole built in, so if you want to attach it to a set of keys you’ll need to pay a little more to add a holder. (We don’t really recommend drilling a hole into it, though &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FHow%2Bto%2BDrill%2Ba%2BKeyring%2BHole%2Bin%2Ban%2BAirTag%2F143068&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit has a guide&lt;/a&gt; if you insist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S0KD9T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OP3rsJ"&gt;When it’s outside the Bluetooth range of your phone, the AirTag taps into the massive network of iPhone devices using Find My to provide an approximate location. This is a huge benefit, especially in the US where iPhones abound. As long as your item is in a place with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it will likely be “seen” by an iPhone nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XmpgHp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As long as your item is in a place with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it will likely be “seen” by an iPhone nearby&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkECyk"&gt;In-range, AR-assisted finding does a good job of tracking down an object that’s out of sight. A big, easy-to-follow arrow appears on screen when the signal is strong enough (you’ll be prompted with a vague message to move around if you’re too far for a strong signal) and guides you in the right direction. I had no problem locating a tag under a couch cushion in my house. It would be helpful if the “weak signal” message indicated if the signal got stronger as you move around (Samsung’s AR finding does this) but that’s my only complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0q41aP"&gt;If you’d like to altogether avoid the headache of leaving something behind, Apple is adding a separation alert feature in iOS 15 that may help. Once set up, it will send a notification if it detects that your iPhone (and by extension, you) have gone out of range and left it behind. Tile also offers this feature with its Premium subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Zu4DCPNye2enQZo0XfHl_FbQL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702211/ajohnson_210702_4659_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmartTag Plus includes AR-assisted finding for objects in close range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="07bZ8a"&gt;Samsung SmartTag Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dHJGkw"&gt;The $39 SmartTag Plus is Samsung’s UWB-equipped tag; there’s also a non-UWB version for $10 less. The SmartTag Plus offers broadly similar Bluetooth-range finding and AR-assist as the AirTag, with a few differences. AR finding mode provides a view through the phone’s camera with guiding arrows that appear on the screen, which is a little more helpful than Apple’s arrow-only guide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="doXMn8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDi1au"&gt;You can also use the button on a SmartTag as a kind of remote starter for smart home automations if you’re invested in Samsung’s SmartThings ecosystem. On the downside, the SmartTag has the shortest battery life rating of the three trackers compared here: up to 165 days (less than six months) compared to about a year for the Tile and Apple options. SmartTags don’t offer separation alerts at the moment either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QZmIv6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the SmartTag gave me an accurate enough location that I could have driven up I-5 myself and located the tag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yBoLCQ"&gt;Out-of-range, the SmartTag Plus relies on other Galaxy devices that have chosen to participate in Samsung’s Galaxy Find network — Galaxy phone users aren’t opted in by default, and need to give consent in the SmartThings app. Samsung says that as of April 2021, there were &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745743505176533597" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more than 70 million “helper devices” participating globally&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple counts hundreds of millions of users&lt;/a&gt; in its Find My network. There are simply fewer people in the US with Galaxy phones than iPhones, so it can’t quite compete with the AirTag, but that’s a moot point anyway since nobody is likely to be comparison shopping between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2tdm2"&gt;Experiences will vary — more so than with an AirTag — but at least in the northern suburbs of Seattle, there were enough Galaxy Find users out and about to track a tag on a cross-town journey with multiple stops. Knowing the actual location of the object, er, spouse who agreed to let me track him, the SmartTag did identify his position accurately at two of three stops. It only returned a location a couple of times when he was on the interstate getting to his destination, but in a fairly busy business park and at a restaurant, the SmartTag gave me an accurate enough location that I could have driven up I-5 myself and located the tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eNM85lo7N16YWsKU7QsiGNbEksk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702206/ajohnson_210702_4659_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile’s tags work with both iOS and Android devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="quRzYe"&gt;Tile Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6mesvM"&gt;Tile has been the tracking tag category heavyweight of the last few years — at least until Samsung and Apple showed up. The Pro is the company’s highest-specced model at $34, with a bigger Bluetooth range (400 feet) and a louder maximum ring volume than other current Tile tags. There’s no Ultra Wideband here, and thus no AR-assisted finding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yAgNuq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="btTY78"&gt;Separation alerts are available as part of Tile’s $29/year Premium subscription, but all of the essential features are included with your Tile tag purchase, including out-of-range finding. This “community find” feature relies on other Tile users — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424837/tile-amazon-sidewalk-support-release-date-2021-bluetooth-tracking-airtags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as of June 14th, Amazon’s Sidewalk network&lt;/a&gt; — the way Samsung and Apple’s trackers rely on other Galaxy phones and iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WzYkQ"&gt;Even with help from Sidewalk, the Tile Pro’s peer-location network seems to lag behind Samsung and Apple’s. On the same journey up I-5 that the SmartTag Plus took, the Tile Pro returned a location ping less frequently, and only got one of the stops on the trip precisely right (it was close but across the street on another one) where the SmartTag was accurate on two locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mUmqjJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even with help from Sidewalk, the Tile Pro’s peer-location network seems to lag behind Samsung and Apple’s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OJlei"&gt;This was honestly a better performance than I was expecting, though Seattle probably has more than its usual share of Sidewalk-supporting Amazon devices for obvious reasons. Even if it’s an atypical result, it’s fair to say that the community find feature would work well enough to tell you that you really &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; lose something, even if it’s less likely that you’ll be able to hunt down its exact location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbsdOV"&gt;I do have one minor complaint to lodge against the Tile app: the subscription upsell. A couple of app menus include features that are only available with the Premium plan, and tapping them brings up a page prompting you to start a free trial to access them. I expect to see those kinds of things during setup, or if I’m using a free app like Strava, but it’s a little annoying from something I’ve already paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlbF1T"&gt;Tile also offers its trackers in a couple of different form factors, including a wallet-friendly Slim version and a small adhesive-backed Sticker tag. There are plenty of third-party cases and holders for AirTags in particular if you want to adapt it for different objects, but you can’t buy an AirTag or a SmartTag in a fundamentally different shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="btAqHr"&gt;AirTag or Tile Pro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XqsNHq"&gt;If you have an iPhone, there’s a very simple answer to this question: just get the AirTag. The Apple Find My network is so extensive (at least in the US) that you’ll have the best chance of tracking down something the tag is attached to. Maybe there’s an exception to this recommendation if you really want Tile’s subscription features or mix of form factors, but by and large this is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RWH2Kx"&gt;SmartTag Plus or Tile Pro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pbD9SM"&gt;If you have a Samsung phone you’ll probably be better off with the SmartTag Plus. The Galaxy Find network isn’t as robust as Apple’s, but it’s still ahead of Tile’s. If you already use smart home devices in Samsung’s SmartThings network, then there’s even more reason to choose SmartTag since it can act as a remote control for automations. The shorter battery life is a shame and the lack of separation notifications stinks, so if those are sticking points you could consider the Tile Pro. Otherwise, the SmartTag Plus (or non-UWB version, depending on your phone) is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YS3j0F"&gt;Tile or… ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FHfboY"&gt;If you don’t have an iPhone or a Galaxy device, your choice is between the Tile Pro and… everything else. Tile’s out-of-range network can’t compete with the number of devices Samsung and Apple have in our pockets, but it seems to be getting a healthy boost from Sidewalk, and can only get better as more people add Echo and Ring devices to their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7nh3V8"&gt;If community finding features are less important, &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en/pages/products" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chipolo is worth a look&lt;/a&gt;. We didn’t test it in this batch, but it does include separation notifications without an annual fee. Overall, the Tile Pro feels like a good compromise between paying for something more expensive and power-intensive like a cellular tracker, or a more basic, Bluetooth-only tracker. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants in on NFL Sunday Ticket</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NFL: JAN 03 Cardinals at Rams" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Owq7vq-V_FDWyTT4iUokJpfv5OQ=/0x107:3400x2374/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562937/1230461244.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kevin Reece / Icon Sportswire / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iRhDMy"&gt;In the quest to get people to pay monthly for video, having the rights to stream sports, especially football, is key. Apple might finally be playing that game to spruce up Apple TV Plus: &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-in-early-talks-with-nfl-on-sunday-ticket-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the trillion-dollar phone maker has expressed early interest in securing the rights to the NFL’s Sunday Ticket package — a subscription covering every game that is not airing on local affiliates —  for its video service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJRiRn"&gt;The NFL has reportedly not entered into actual negotiations yet, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ourand_SBJ/status/1413534186208600065?s=20"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Sports Business Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s John Ourand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and Apple likely won’t be the only company competing. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; writes that other streaming competitors, like Disney’s ESPN Plus and Amazon’s Prime Video, are likely also trying to secure even more games for their platforms. Currently Sunday Ticket is held by DirecTV, but its contract is up in 2022, which means there's an opportunity to shop around for an even more lucrative deal. DirecTV is also going through its own transition, as AT&amp;amp;T plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301840/att-tpg-directv-tv-uverse-new-company-announced"&gt;spin out the satellite company&lt;/a&gt; and its other non-WarnerMedia video businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVddp6"&gt;Sunday Ticket was actually a condition for AT&amp;amp;T merging with DirecTV in the first place in 2014. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/19/5730854/att-can-bail-on-merger-if-directv-loses-nfl-sunday-ticket"&gt;gave itself an out of its then-$48.5 billion deal&lt;/a&gt; if DirecTV wasn’t able to reach an agreement with the NFL. It ultimately did, but according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, the service has mainly lost DirecTV and AT&amp;amp;T money heading into 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HjvvsK"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said it would “pay net losses” on the Sunday Ticket up to $2.5 billion over the remaining period of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ELAGP2"&gt;There’s good reason to take Apple seriously, even if it’s not ultimately able to secure the bag. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-jim-delorenzo-live-sports-streaming-841a91c7-24d9-4f69-98c9-b60dabb8f1bc.html"&gt;The company poached Jim DeLorenzo&lt;/a&gt;, the former Amazon executive in charge of leading the company’s sports efforts, in 2020. He could be very well be scheduling lunches with NFL bigwigs as I write this, though it’s not clear what a deal would look like with Apple. Amazon has developed a successful relationship with the NFL over the years, gaining exclusive rights to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417957/amazon-nfl-thursday-night-football-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, so maybe the groundwork DeLorenzo laid there will transfer over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQ58fy"&gt;Either way, the heat is on, and with Apple trying to make TV Plus even more enticing, it's yet another hand trying to exchange money for the most watched sport on US television.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Getting something great only costs $50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NGkXEr"&gt;Looking for a new TV gadget to stream all of your favorite entertainment? Buying an excellent streaming device is easier in 2021 than ever before — and the prices only continue to drop and get more appealing: $50 is the sweet spot if you want a streaming stick or set-top box that can do crisp 4K resolution, Dolby Vision / HDR, and immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound. Each of the picks below has its own strengths, whether it’s a snazzier interface, better voice controls, or a more comprehensive universal search for digging through all of your services. Depending on your wants, there are several good contenders, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the best streaming device for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xj845F"&gt;Pretty much any 4K TV you buy today will come with a batch of built-in streaming apps. But they won’t always have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. (For example, my LG OLED still somehow doesn’t have HBO Max.) So a dedicated streaming device is the best way to guarantee you’ll be able to watch that show or movie everyone’s been talking about. You can spend less money on entry-level Roku or Amazon streaming players, but you’ll be better off with one of our recommendations if you want your purchase to last. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features and fantastic price of the Chromecast with Google TV make it the best streaming stick for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9cOJvp"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best streaming stick for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3U9Abh"&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the home screen on a streaming stick should look like. That’s really the long and short of why the Chromecast with Google TV has taken the crown of best streaming player. With its new Google TV software, the company has taken a content-first approach that feels more focused and refined than what Amazon and Apple have managed in their own attempts to aggregate popular shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lr5ZDG"&gt;On a Roku or Fire TV, my instinct is always to head right for the app where I want to watch something. But with the Chromecast, I’m equally happy browsing through Google’s rows of recommendations. The Google TV software always clearly shows where content is coming from — you can pick which streaming apps get factored into these recs — and it also provides helpful information (like Rotten Tomatoes ratings) at the surface level when you’re hunting for that night’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XINYdJ"&gt;When you actually hit play, you’re punted over to Netflix or Prime Video or HBO Max just like always, but there’s no avoiding that. In terms of app selection, Google’s got all of the main players covered. You can still cast content to the Chromecast from your phone or laptop, and Google Assistant voice searches consistently work well and showcase Google’s accurate voice recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHgD8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the software on a streaming device should look like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKXPL"&gt;Everything about Google TV feels tasteful, from the fonts to the way the background color subtly shifts to match the artwork of whatever content is highlighted. And the universal Watchlist, which lets you put together a list of stuff you’re interested in from various streaming services, is super convenient — especially since you can add to it from the web or your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUEQwj"&gt;But not everything about the Chromecast with Google TV is perfect. The software can slow down from time to time, and some customers have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/07/chromecast-google-tv-data-corrupt-android-cant-load-error/"&gt;encountered significant bugs&lt;/a&gt; that Google has tried to iron out with software updates. More annoyingly, despite the hardware supporting both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, there are still very popular apps like Disney Plus — which delivers both on other platforms — that aren’t doing so on the Chromecast. HBO Max says it does Atmos, but that hasn’t been my experience. Why? Who knows, but these inconsistencies are a mark against Google. And as for the Watchlist, some services like Netflix have already started removing their shows from it. Again, that’s something Google has no control over, but it does lessen the feature’s usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e1vJvx"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, the best streaming device for ease of use, plugged into a TV." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GeG7Xng7wS70oeIPS1EBLvuW_9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9578455/akrales_171031_2100_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With its easy-to-use software, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is the best streaming device for people looking for a good, simple option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z2csvA"&gt;2. Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hOCseD"&gt;The best streaming device for people who want to keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7O9OD"&gt;It’s hard to really complain about a Roku. The company’s streaming devices are about as simple and straightforward as they come. All of your apps are laid out in a big grid, which can make the experience feel a bit siloed — but there’s no beating that ease of use. And Roku has tried to touch up and modernize the home screen a bit with new sections like “Featured Free” to highlight content you can stream without any subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qjIbaE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGj91j"&gt;Despite some occasional spats with content companies, Roku now has pretty much all of the entertainment you could want, including (most recently) HBO Max and Peacock. And the wonderfully neutral universal search remains one of the best aspects of the platform, favoring your existing subscriptions and free-to-stream options over making you pay money to rent or buy. And the company’s Roku Channel has grown into a legitimate streaming app of its own, offering a mix of ad-sponsored movies, TV shows, and live news for those days when you’re burned out on combing through Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVnPjT"&gt;The $50 Streaming Stick Plus remains the best overall pick among Roku’s hardware when you weigh price and performance. It gives you HDR, Dolby Atmos, and speedy performance. The main thing you’ll miss out on is Dolby Vision. If that’s a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, you should look at the $100 Roku Ultra set-top box instead, which also includes an Ethernet port for optional wired connectivity and a helpful remote finder feature. Plus, the Ultra’s remote has customizable shortcut buttons and a headphone jack so you can listen privately to whatever’s on-screen if you’re trying to keep quiet at night. (Other Rokus let you do the latter with the company’s mobile app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IoeY"&gt;If there’s one area where Roku falls flat, it’s probably voice search. Your voice queries for specific shows or movies should work well enough, but Roku lags Amazon and Google when it comes to natural language interactions. (And forget about using your voice to control smart home gadgets or look up entertainment-related facts.) Still, the company is adding other perks to offset that weakness. Late last year, it added support for Apple’s AirPlay, letting you easily send content from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the TV screen. Speaking of Apple…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mqu6OJ02NVqztRrNUIgGTb3A18E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541100/DSCF3875_2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV 4K offers the most consistent, reliable performance of any streaming device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JRXodl"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K (second-generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWJwP1"&gt;The best streaming device overall experience (for a steep price)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="M2y4K0"&gt;It’s fair to look at the Apple TV 4K as overpriced compared to its competitors, but Apple’s set-top box still has its own set of appealing qualities. The interface is fantastic. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos across a wide variety of services, has all of the important apps checked off, and also gives you add-ons like Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness Plus (if you pay for them) that you won’t find on other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0yQqy"&gt;Apps sometimes have a higher level of polish on Apple TV and are generally better about taking advantage of everything the box can do. Another benefit of the Apple TV is privacy — to some extent. Apple itself isn’t obsessed with tracking your viewing data in the same way that a company like Roku is, but the streaming apps can still see what you’re doing. I generally think consumers aren’t particularly averse to sharing their streaming habits, but Apple’s privacy practices might matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUc2Xv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7S0fB"&gt;Even with AirPlay now on Roku, the Apple TV still wins out for people deeply invested in Apple’s ecosystem. You can use HomePods as its speakers or connect two sets of AirPods for private listening with audio sharing. You can view the feed from HomeKit security cameras or see who is at the door if you have a HomeKit video doorbell. The Apple TV still makes it easy to tap into content on a Mac in your home, and services like Apple Music and iCloud Photo Library are right there in easy reach on the TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0nOC"&gt;And with the 2021 model of the Apple TV 4K, Apple has finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;redesigned the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; with a much simpler, more intuitive button layout that adds power and mute controls. It’s larger and harder to lose in the couch cushions, too. The second-gen Apple TV 4K is also now more future-proofed as a smart home hub with the inclusion of Thread support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Yh1ylb"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQ6Oml67NEpEL1BJiRk4Z7fw5Iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13360395/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K checks off all the boxes for HDR support and costs just $50, making it the best streaming stick for people in Amazon’s ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6ajwme"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mO4Da0"&gt;The best streaming stick if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iAlxyK"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is yet another popular pick in that $50 range of streaming gadgets. The latest model added support for Dolby Vision, which made it the only product to offer everything HDR (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, HDR10) for such little money — until the new Chromecast came along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HanEXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oDfmk8"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K’s software is similar to the Chromecast in that the home screen takes a content-focused approach instead of just throwing a grid of apps at you. Amazon tends to showcase its own Prime Video content more prominently than shows and movies from other services, but the newly revamped software goes a long way in improving the look and feel of the Fire TV. Alexa voice commands with the remote also work reliably, whether you’re saying “open Netflix” or asking to dim the smart lights in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0rvix"&gt;Amazon offers most major streaming apps, but there are some frustrating omissions: Vudu — a good source of Dolby Vision movies — and Peacock are both still absent from the Fire TV platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i6E5A2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351738"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JiAvz9"&gt;There’s also the $120 Fire TV Cube to consider. It essentially doubles as a streaming device and small smart speaker. Rather than make you press and hold a button to speak to Alexa like with the Stick 4K, the Cube takes a hands-free approach and has beamforming mics that respond to “Alexa” prompts just like an Echo speaker would. It also features something Amazon calls Local Voice Control, which allows it to understand more spoken commands without needing help from the cloud. The Fire TV Cube has a more powerful processor than the Fire TV Stick 4K, making it the fastest of the Fire TV bunch, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pssjk4"&gt;When it comes to their streaming capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube are on equal footing. And you could always put the money you save by going with the Stick toward one of those new sphere-shaped Echo Dots, which will sound far better than the Cube’s tinny built-in speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zkClUu"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia’s Shield TV, the best streaming player for home theater experts and gamers, pictured on a table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dEmAuOHlgj4pGSulYPpS4vSMAlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19324253/DSCF4370.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV is a powerful Android TV streaming box that’s popular with home theater enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qJ9DFz"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ktAsFL"&gt;Best streaming device for home theater enthusiasts and gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bTK5Wu"&gt;Home theater enthusiasts, gamers, and people who like to tinker with their streaming devices have loyally stuck with Nvidia’s Shield TV and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. They can serve as excellent players like any of our other picks, but you can also go more advanced and use them for cloud gaming or set up a Plex media library (in the case of the Pro). GeForce Now and Steam Link probably do more to sell gamers on the Shield lineup versus something like Apple Arcade on the Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="useqbH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmo5EB"&gt;The Nvidia Shields currently run Android TV with Google Assistant built in, but it’s expected they’ll eventually get the same Google TV experience that’s on the Chromecast. Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling can eke out some extra detail from the shows and movies you stream, and I’d rate the included remote control (with backlit buttons, even) as the most ergonomic of them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVfT5g"&gt;But like with the Apple TV, the main hurdle here is the price. The Nvidia Shield TV costs $150, so you’re looking at spending $100 more than devices that offer most of the same functionality. You get Ethernet and a very powerful streaming device for the added premium, and you can push the Shield TV farther and make it do more than just about any of its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alto’s Odyssey is adding a vibrant new city for its Apple Arcade debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Md23lF_0-J-SEU6XdwJ2VOMqN9s=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69560629/06_TheLostCity.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MOYytX"&gt;When the team behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035830/altos-odyssey-sequel-iphone-game-ios-adventure-snowboarding"&gt;the serene adventure &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were working on the sequel, they had a lot of ideas that didn’t make it into the final release. One of those was a vibrant city that would be the game’s fourth biome, joining the existing desert, canyons, and ancient temples. For various reasons, the city was cut from the final release. But when the chance came to bring the game to Apple Arcade as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;the streaming service’s recent expansion&lt;/a&gt;, it made sense to go back to the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8kTN8"&gt;The result is &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt;, which is coming to Arcade next week. “We’re thinking of &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; as a special edition of &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;,” says lead artist and designer Harry Nesbitt. “We’ve been able to go back to the drawing board a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrSJwG"&gt;The core of the game will remain the same as the original version. That means &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; is an endless runner, where players ride a sandboard across a procedurally-generated desert landscape. It’s a mix of chill and challenge that has made the series so enduring. The Apple Arcade version simply adds a new area — but one that really changes the tone. “It’s very much a living, breathing city,” says Nesbitt. “It’s not a dusty ruin or empty wilderness like some of the other spaces we’ve depicted. It’s vibrant and alive, and has almost a party atmosphere to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQV06y"&gt;One of the challenges, he says, was making sure that the new area wasn’t too much of a jolt to players. The team didn’t want players jumping straight from a quiet desert to a bustling city, which is where the procedural aspect of &lt;em&gt;Alto&lt;/em&gt; came in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AL5b6UbGGx7i85CABYZUm6NPEbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22707013/alto_tlc_the_verge.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Snowman&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GLzGDA"&gt;“It’s definitely something we tried to be careful with,” he explains. “We don’t want it to be jarring in any sense. But because it’s a procedural game, we already have a natural progression for revealing new content to players. We try not to throw everything at them at once; we try to pace it out so that one thing leads to another. Just as you’re getting comfortable with one aspect of the game, a new thread opens up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAT52j"&gt;The expanded version of the game also offered a chance to build on the storytelling, something that’s grown over the course of the series. While the &lt;em&gt;Alto&lt;/em&gt; games don’t have an explicit story with cutscenes or dialogue, there is clear worldbuilding going on. As Nesbitt explains it, the developers want players to feel like there’s more that “exists beyond the edges of the screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJGBLL"&gt;And while the idea dates back a few years, the current version of &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; was inspired in part by the pandemic, and the fact that so many of us have been trapped inside, largely unable to travel or experience the outdoors. “I think &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; has always been a little bit about the idea of traveling and going outside of your comfort zone,” says Nesbitt, “and &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; is a natural extension of that idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVTcEL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; launches on Apple Arcade on July 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9UyzJ"&gt;Not every day is chock-full of deals on the devices we love most, and while great discounts still seem relatively scarce post-Prime Day, there are still a handful of price reductions and sales to make note of. Right now, for instance, Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple AirPods Max for $478&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price to date on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;Apple’s over-ear headphones&lt;/a&gt;. Although heavy, Apple’s first pair of dedicated cans offer terrific noise cancellation, a dependable set of controls, and Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;apt-titled spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;, a neat piece of software that adds a greater sense of depth to select content (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;including thousands of tracks in the Apple Music catalog&lt;/a&gt;). Pair those hallmarks with balanced sound and a luxe, premium build and you have one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best pairs of noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="kChrSN"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new phone, the OnePlus 9 isn’t a bad way to go. It doesn’t offer every feature found on flagships like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy 21&lt;/a&gt; — it lacks a telephoto lens, for instance, and the main camera is void of optical image stabilization — but it’s lightning-quick and sports one of the best ultrawide cameras to be found. It’s also outfitted with a great, 120Hz display and fast 65W wired charging. It doesn’t support AT&amp;amp;T’s network, but if you’re looking for a premium Android phone without the premium price, you can currently pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Y73NTXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1629059-REG%2Foneplus_5011101580_9_128gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F9%2F22569305%2Fapple-airpods-max-oneplus-9-android-phone-xbox-series-s-bundle-ring-video-doorbell-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo for $650&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price we’ve seen on the midrange phone to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SOr8Uc"&gt;The Xbox Series S hasn’t been as difficult to come by as the more-capable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not exactly easy to find, either. Yes, Microsoft’s compact, digital-only console is limited to 364GB of usable storage and doesn’t offer the same kind of processing power as the Series X, but it’s still compatible with all the same games and brims with potential, especially if you’re looking for a more affordable way to jump into next-gen or want to tap into one of the many terrific titles available via Game Pass. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Both new iPad Pros. The 11-inch lacks Mini LED, but it still has a great screen with ProMotion." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fIKQoREOPZFBpCMS7TgCZg7ZMqc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69559860/vpavic_210516_4592_0267.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lUFHic"&gt;Apple plans to add a Mini LED screen to the 11-inch iPad Pro in 2022, following the introduction of the technology on this year’s 12.9-inch model, according to a research note by analyst Ming-chi Kuo. The note was reported on by &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/09/mini-led-coming-to-11-inch-ipad-pro-in-2022-kuo-says"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/09/kuo-2022-11-inch-ipad-pro-mini-led/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hi5FRD"&gt;Apple released new versions of the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro this year, both featuring M1 processors but only the larger model including a Mini LED display. Mini LED is a new screen technology that involves using thousands of tiny LEDs to create focused local dimming zones, allowing for better contrast and HDR performance. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro has 2,500 local dimming zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1Y3S64"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPad Pro (2021) review: dream screen ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="i2xnD9"&gt;Kuo also says that Apple is planning to bring Mini LED screens to the MacBook line. 14-inch and 16-inch Mini LED models are reportedly going into production this quarter, while Kuo believes a redesigned MacBook Air with the display technology will be released in 2022. That’s a claim he’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;made before&lt;/a&gt;, also saying that cheaper iPad models would switch to OLED panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUTwbY"&gt;Mini LED technology was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; to have been the cause of supply constraints for the new iPad Pro before it launched earlier this year. The device still isn’t readily in stock, with Apple estimating shipping times of between two to three weeks for most models on its US website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s upcoming 9/11 documentary focuses on the 12 hours after the attacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1p-LTEYLgTBsDcmAgmxRTDDH0c=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69558628/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="02s40q"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F07%2Fapple-announces-documentary-911-inside-the-presidents-war-room-narrated-by-emmy-award-winner-jeff-daniels%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F8%2F22568985%2Fapple-tv-plus-9-11-documentary-presidents-war-room" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it will commemorate the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks with the release of a new documentary in September. &lt;em&gt;9/11: The President’s War Room, &lt;/em&gt;released in partnership with the BBC&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will focus on the 12 hours that followed immediately after the first plane hit the World Trade Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ED5rnz"&gt;The new film is directed by Adam Wishart, a British director known for the Channel 4 documentary about Somali warlords living in the suburbs, &lt;em&gt;Warlords Next Door&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;While an immediately less intriguing premise than suburban warlords, &lt;em&gt;9/11: The President’s War Room &lt;/em&gt;does sound like it might have gotten more access than previous retellings of 9/11. Apple claims the documentary features never-before-seen testimony from key parties like President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and Colin Powell, plus “nearly 200 never previously published photographs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmW5ug"&gt;Film and television focused on national tragedies are a grim business, with the promise of offending someone affected hiding around every corner, but they’re not wholly uncharted territory for streaming services. &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/the-looming-tower-hulu-review.html"&gt;Hulu’s &lt;em&gt;The Looming Tower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which fictionalized the events leading up to 9/11 and how government agencies bungled their response, earned Emmy nominations for some of its cast. Jeff Daniels, who's nominated for his performance in &lt;em&gt;The Looming Tower,&lt;/em&gt; will also narrate Apple’s new doc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krG4qm"&gt;Naturally, Apple also has its own interest in snatching up glossy, awards-friendly documentaries. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/26/21081221/boys-state-review-movie-documentary-american-politics"&gt;Last year’s &lt;em&gt;Boys State&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while unfortunately not Oscar-nominated, was a smash hit at the Sundance Film Festival, winning the festival’s grand jury prize before Apple snatched it up. Two of the company’s docuseries, &lt;em&gt;Tiny World &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Earth at Night in Color&lt;/em&gt;, have also been nominated for awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsM9SQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ndZckU4N8rhNAvTM3h79RZ4Q17Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525167/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hands-on with the public betas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RGStJw"&gt;iOS 15 and iPad 15 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;kicking off their public betas today&lt;/a&gt;, and after a few weeks with the developer betas of the new software, Apple’s OS updates feel like more of a grab bag of new features than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGHjhM"&gt;A major rethinking of either platform, this year’s updates are not. The two updates were clearly born in 2020’s norm-shattering pandemic. The feature list at WWDC and on Apple’s website wears last year’s remote-first influences firmly, from the heavy emphasis on FaceTime features to a better system for corralling notifications into “work” and “personal” buckets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCtoK8"&gt;Of course, Apple’s release cadence and insistence on major updates coming just once a year means that some of these features are arriving in what will — hopefully — be a post-pandemic return to life this fall. So it’ll be interesting to see how things like SharePlay, one of the update’s marquee features, actually shake out once people have the option to watch movies and listen to music together in person again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82OTUS"&gt;Other parts of iOS and iPadOS 15, like the overhauled Safari app or the new Maps app, feel like the kinds of more noticeable changes generally associated with Apple’s major software updates, but they’re sporadic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9D4var"&gt;The result is a software update that feels a lot quieter than Apple’s usual releases, one that — at least for now — looks to improve smaller things behind the scenes than rebuild things from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-YOwTs3Mxm7lXWTL3BFGCCtW8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689245/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iOS 15 homescreen is largely unchanged from iOS 14. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGKdwT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceTime and SharePlay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Nan3wn"&gt;The flashiest feature coming to the fall updates is SharePlay, a new Apple-wide system built on top of FaceTime for sharing TV shows, movies, music, and podcasts with friends and family even when you’re not in the same room. It’s also the most pandemic-inspired feature, an Apple product-based spin on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307583/watch-videos-movies-online-friends-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-scener-extensions"&gt;countless watch party apps and services&lt;/a&gt; that sprung up to replace movie nights over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="warmv9"&gt;SharePlay shows off how well Apple’s hardware and software services all work together: watching a TV show or listening to an album over FaceTime is seamless. But it also highlights the height of Apple’s walled garden: developers have to choose to use SharePlay — which is missing big names like Netflix and YouTube right now — and it only works on Apple hardware, despite the expansion of FaceTime and the Apple TV app to other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FEgxPx_dNvDn7GZ-gzLRUEouR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691037/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_10.11.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k8DJV1"&gt;And since content is streamed locally, everyone watching or listening has to have access to it, meaning that you can’t share an episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;with a friend who’s not a TV Plus subscriber, nor can you both watch the same movie if only one of you has purchased it from iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXcJ1T"&gt;FaceTime is also getting a wide variety of long-overdue updates that help cement it as a more viable video chatting application: a sorely needed grid view, screen sharing, a portrait mode to blur your messy background, and the ability to FaceTime with Windows and Android users (in web browsers) thanks to sharable links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGPKYn"&gt;These are all badly needed features for FaceTime, but they’re also the sort of thing that remains bewildering to have had to wait until September 2021 for, especially given the reliance on video calling over the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YfJml"&gt;Unlike SharePlay, though, the FaceTime improvements feel like the kind of thing that will remain front and center even as things start to go back to normal, although the Apple product focus and more limited feature set when compared to professional solutions like Zoom or Microsoft Teams mean that FaceTime won’t be making a play for business meetings any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tEy0Z1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZhK4nw"&gt;As is traditional for an iOS update, Apple has done some tinkering with notifications on iOS 15. Some of the smaller notifications are bigger now, and feature contact images — which might be the push to get people to actually add photos to their contacts, something that doesn’t generally exist in the real world outside of an Apple presentation in my experience. And apps that you care less about can be filtered to a new summary mode that’s delivered several times a day, instead of pinging you for each notification right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVieJE"&gt;But the bigger addition is the new Focus feature, and after only a few weeks of using it, it’s already one of my favorite features on iOS in years. On the surface, Focus is an expansion of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb feature, but instead of a blanket mute, Focus allows you to select specific apps and contacts to share notifications at specific times or specific triggers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wwnvgScnLVZ0lgi5r3_OifdHWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691389/focus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus settings (left), the expanded Do Not Disturb menu (middle), and Focus-siloed notifications (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7U7n"&gt;A “work” Focus, for example, can be set to activate when you’re on the clock and mute all notifications except from your email, Slack, and calendar apps, then automatically switch off when you’re off work. Focus modes can be triggered by specific times, locations (like when you get to your office or home from work) or when opening a specific app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="trNbrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Focus gives you real control over filtering notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRnXl4"&gt;So far, I’ve mostly just been using a “personal” focus for weekends and evenings to automatically mute any work Slacks and emails until the morning, which has been absolutely delightful. Apple’s machine learning also tries to learn from how you use your phone — for example, it suggested that I add a sports app I use a lot during “personal” time to the whitelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnjYef"&gt;And while Focus can be used in conjunction with Apple’s Screen Time feature, it’s not a totally cohesive system: for example, there’s no way to automatically disable work apps like Slack when in a “personal” Focus mode. It just shuts off notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qA9Ae"&gt;Focus also lets you assign specific homescreen pages to each Focus mode — including widgets — for even more customized experiences. iOS has also added the option to add duplicate icons for apps (so you can still have Apple Music visible on both a “personal” and a “work” homescreen, for example). But I’m a big fan of the feature, since it gives me a good reason to actually set up homescreens with widgets, and helps curb the instinct to tap the Slack icon when I’m supposed to be offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg2Joz"&gt;There’s also a new kind of notification to go with Focus and the morning summary feature, called “Time Sensitive Notifications,” which can override specific notification filtering features, so you don’t miss urgent alerts from your bank, for instance. Apple has specific rules for when developers can use these, but we’ll have to wait to see how they’re actually implemented when apps get updated this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eQJ6s9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safari explores a new look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sa-F42U9akLG4HUc8T5Q-CFoKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691391/safari.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Safari’s new design, with the rearranged URL bar.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mrCBnF"&gt;Safari has been entirely redesigned in iOS 15. In terms of material changes to iOS, this is the biggest, and it’s coming to what might be the most essential application on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP04AG"&gt;For the iPhone in particular, that means an emphasis on a one-handed design that moves the URL bar to the bottom of the screen, adds a swiping gesture interface, and a tab grouping feature (which is also coming to iPadOS and macOS Monterey). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ7LM1"&gt;I’m still getting used to it, even with a few days of use under my belt, and of all the additions in the latest software update, I suspect it’ll be the most polarizing. Over a decade of muscle memory has trained my brain to reach up for the menu bar on smartphones. I get Apple’s motivation in moving it to the bottom, making it easier to reach on the increasingly large phones it makes and putting the actual content of devices front and center at the top of the screen, it’s still a change that’ll require an adjustment period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qCUCdYYVSJw438QnZ8SDpmQE4lU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689246/cgartenberg_210629_4653_003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iPadOS 15 allows for widgets on the homescreen now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j5vaNa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad multitasking: what’s a computer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="luHkRC"&gt;Overall, iPadOS 15 gets a lot of the same improvements as the iPhone update. There’s a few iPad-specific features, though, starting with two major features from iOS 14 that were oddly missing last year: widgets on the homescreen and the App Library (which comes with a spiffy animation when you open it). I still can’t explain why Apple didn’t add those features last year, but they’re extremely welcome now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4rff1"&gt;Widgets, as expected, work even better on the iPad than they do on the iPhone, given the bigger homescreen. It’s not as big of a sacrifice to give up a quarter of your homescreen for widgets when there’s still so much extra space on the screen. Apple has also added even &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; widget sizes, the biggest size of which is roughly the same area as an entire iPhone 12 display when viewed on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Despite the massive size, Widgets still have the same functionality as they do on the iPhone, meaning that they’re focused on glanceable information rather than more interactive mini applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaF2Fz"&gt;Apple is also continuing to refine multitasking on the iPad with two new additions: a multitasking icon (three dots at the top of the display) that makes it easier to use the different split-view and slide-over modes it introduced in 2019, and a “shelf” that shows all the open windows for a particular app when you open it or tap the multitasking icon. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vQ2rbcsyuXVwyn4YZJjxh2girI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691086/IMG_0008.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking on iPadOS 15 is still... a lot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MbzDBs"&gt;The new multitasking setup is better, albeit still slightly confusing. Putting a single app into split view using the new menu punts you back to the homescreen to select a second app (or the same app again) to view in split-screen mode. Apps can be dragged and dropped when you’re in the app switching window to create new split-screen or full-screen combinations. The multitasking dots light up to show which app in split-screen is in focus, which is incrementally better than the bar from before. And swiping down on the multitasking dots is now an almost home-button-like experience, closing that app and letting you select a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ndrGX"&gt;There are still a lot of ways to move things around and arrange things and keyboard shortcuts available — so much so that Apple has a new menu when you hold the globe key to view system and multitasking shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqls37"&gt;But there’s still plenty of friction here. iPadOS remains unpredictable: I’m never 100 percent sure what version of an open app or app windows will open when I tap in on my homescreen. Just opening a new window is still an opaque process that involves dragging and dropping things around in split view. Slide-over panels still live in their own, separate confusing world. Split view is still frustratingly rigid, letting you have exactly two apps open with a third visible as a slide-over panel, instead of any other configuration (like one large app on the left and two smaller ones on the right). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8yAG2j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An iPad operating system with iPad apps — and that’s just how Apple likes it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MxrfpE"&gt;Ultimately, the new multitasking and split-screen views are a refinement of the older system, rather than some grand new paradigm for how to use an iPad. Those who like the iPad’s software abilities will likely find the new additions and enhancements to those modes nice. But those who were hoping that iPadOS 15 would offer a wildly overhauled windowing system — especially in the wake of Apple’s M1 upgrade in the latest iPad Pro — are going to be disappointed. Apple may do some additional tweaks or changes before iPadOS 15 launches this fall, but it’s unlikely to do any sweeping design changes for this update. iPadOS is still firmly an iPad operating system with iPad apps, and that seems to be how Apple likes things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3jMKY"&gt;Also new is a Samsung-like “Quick Notes” feature that lets users swipe up from the bottom corner of the display or hit a keyboard shortcut and scribble down a thought, highlight text on a website, or add a link for context. Quick Notes get saved to their own category on the Notes app, and can be accessed from other Apple devices, too. They’re useful, although like many iPadOS 15 features, it’s not something you’d likely figure out how to use without outside prompting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w8vdJA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best of the rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sRILU7"&gt;As is always the case, there are dozens of bigger and smaller features coming in iOS and iPadOS, too. Here are some of the more notable ones to check out on the public beta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKJ4ez"&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive part of the updates, letting you point your camera at any handwritten or typed text to grab a phone number or email address, translate it, or pull it directly into a text field. Apple has quietly made this a system-level feature — meaning that it’s available whenever you’re viewing an image, be it in the live camera feed, an image on the web, or directly from the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="7eJg3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cDWpCArz45zoW0gA6_K0S7khj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691400/text_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Live Text on iOS 15 can capture text directly from a photo feed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbDOvr"&gt;An interesting new addition on both operating systems is a new “Shared with You” feature, which shows photos, Apple Music songs, links, Apple TV Plus content, and podcasts that were shared over iMessage in dedicated rows within those apps. The theory is that if someone texts you a nice photo or their favorite playlist, you’ll be able to see it (and respond to it) in the Photos or Music apps. The feature is unsurprisingly entirely limited to Apple services for now, so sending a Spotify song to someone won’t appear in Spotify. It also might be overestimating how often users send links to TV Plus shows to each other, but showing shared links and photos are admittedly useful (at least, when the feature works properly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F8nIP"&gt;The Weather app has an overhauled design that adds a vertical, Dark Sky-style 10-day forecast and Dark Sky-style maps for temperature and precipitation. It looks nice. Notes and Reminders are both getting hashtags for categorizing and organizing, and the Memories feature in Photos is getting completely overhauled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHpcLX"&gt;Lastly, you can now put your Memoji avatars in outfits. I have no opinion on this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4gSsb6Ov3LMeV40ABqou9nGmF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691105/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1O7u7A"&gt;A lot of the other flashy new features are things we can’t test yet. Apple’s beta is only rolling out new maps to the San Francisco Bay Area to start (although it’ll be in far more locations when the final software is out this fall). IDs and keys in Wallet will also have to wait for broader support from state governments, hotels, and workplaces before we can see how those work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3fEA5"&gt;There are also a lot of features that will have to wait for third-party developers, like Focus statuses or SharePlay in third-party apps, which also have to wait for app updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MvxOuP"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V6Offf"&gt;The most notable thing from my time with the betas, though, is how easy it is to miss the newer features. Outside of the most in-your-face updates like the larger notifications or the new Safari design, most of the updates here are quieter, behind-the-scenes features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bVfAK1"&gt;They’re things that give you more options and ways to use your devices, but they’re just that — options. Focus modes are great for those who want to use them and integrate them into their workflow, but iOS doesn’t go out of its way to advertise them or push you to use them. It’s a mature way of looking at software, and one that’s nice to see, even if it means that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 aren’t the most exciting updates ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBtdHM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSDORv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; iOS 15 added the ability to have multiple app icons for a single app. This article originally stated that it was still not possible to do so. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ladies and gentlemen, a leather case for your MagSafe puck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ILxqlDEUnwChx43BVOb6jJg7F0=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69551329/856500010205_Lifestyle_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if MagSafe, but covered in leather?&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldz8wB"&gt;I’m not going to pretend to understand how product development meetings work, but there must have been something pretty special in the water when Nomad’s crack team of accessory specialists put together its latest pitch. From the company that was brave enough to encase your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111850/nomad-leather-airpods-pro-case-rugged-design-apple-accessory"&gt;AirPods Pro case in leather&lt;/a&gt;, comes an &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/products/leather-cover-for-magsafe-rustic-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all-new leather MagSafe case&lt;/a&gt;. That’s right, it’s a leather case for the iPhone 12’s magnetic charging puck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbQHjj"&gt;Nomad’s argument is that the case, which is available in either black or brown, gives a MagSafe charger “a classic, yet bold new look,” and that it makes the charger slightly bigger and easier to grip to remove from a phone. But it also costs $25. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R5zK_6fLsV4DWMd50ob2xCvu4eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699659/856500010199_Lifestyle_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomad’s expanded leather universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FVhHnC"&gt;As a tech blogger, I consider it my duty to maintain a base level of open-mindedness about new technology. But I also reserve the right in exceptional circumstances to point out when something seems just plain silly, and encasing a charging puck in leather is one of those moments. I can get behind the idea of a leather case for anything you’re going to be carrying around in your pockets to protect it from the stresses of everyday life, but a charger? A charger that you’re almost certainly going to leave plugged in next to your bed for 99 percent of its life? &lt;em&gt;Please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbVkJJ"&gt;If you’re already a fully paid-up member of Nomad’s expanded leather universe, and you’ve already got a leather case for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176171/nomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287731/nomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111850/nomad-leather-airpods-pro-case-rugged-design-apple-accessory"&gt;your AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394331/apple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin"&gt;your AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, then sure, why not also cocoon your MagSafe charger in leather for the hell of it. Maybe try following our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357436/how-to-patina-iphone-x-leather-case-saddle-brown-processor"&gt;exhaustive guide to getting a nice patina&lt;/a&gt; on your leather accessories while you’re at it. You’ve earned it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google crowd out the competition with default apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-BajpgSWY_z9XLxnIOLTmw66pc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550154/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new study shows how Apple and Google’s preinstalled apps dominate their mobile platforms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wJfzM4"&gt;If you use an iPhone or Android phone, chances are the majority of your most-used apps were made by Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysNYXF"&gt;That’s the takeaway from a new Comscore study that ranks the popularity of preinstalled iOS and Android apps, such as Apple’s Messages, alongside apps made by other developers. The results show that the majority of apps people use on their phones in the US come preinstalled by either Apple or Google. The first-of-its-kind report was commissioned by Facebook, one of Apple’s loudest critics, and shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHrZWT"&gt;Preinstalled services dominate when it comes to basics like weather, photos, and clocks, according to the report, suggesting these categories will be difficult for other apps to compete in. Defaults don’t win out exclusively, though: Apple Maps and Music don’t appear on the iOS list at all, and Gmail makes the iOS list several entries below Apple Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c5cAMz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for favoring their own services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzYrnI"&gt;The timing, as Facebook likely intentioned, is apt: Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for how they favor their own services over competitors like Spotify. US lawmakers are currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;reviewing a new set of bills&lt;/a&gt; designed to curb the power of Big Tech, including legislation that could potentially bar Apple and Google from giving their services the upper hand against rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvTGa"&gt;The pushback stems from how Apple and Google bundle their apps and services with their mobile operating systems in ways that some of their competitors think is unfair. The criticism is harsher against Apple, given that it more tightly controls the apps that come preinstalled on the iPhone and doesn’t allow developers to circumvent its App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzrZxb"&gt;At the same time, it has been difficult to know how popular these preinstalled apps are relative to apps made by third-party developers since Apple and Google don’t disclose user numbers for their default apps. Research firms regularly track the popularity of apps that are available for download in app stores, but Comscore’s study is the first real attempt at charting how default mobile apps compete against other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TCKt1W"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/6523915"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tknLNo"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22313379"&gt;full interactive version here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9sO-_nhMbJmafmbNBALEFxq300A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702366/VRG_Data_Top20Apps_BarChart_Vert2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CDcIg6"&gt;To make the report last December, Comscore used data it regularly gathers from apps and websites alongside a survey of roughly 4,000 people asking about the default apps they used during the month of November. The results show that 75 percent of the top 20 apps on iOS in the US were made by Apple, while Google made 60 percent of the top apps on Android. The top four apps on both platforms were made by their respective parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hheye"&gt;Facebook is the only outside developer with more than one app on the iOS list and the only developer with three apps on the list for Android. Randomly, a staggering 78 million people used Apple’s Calculator app — more than the users of Gmail on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcH7KS"&gt;Facebook paid for the Comscore study to show the “impact of preinstalled apps on the competitive app ecosystem,” according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The social network’s executives have long criticized Apple’s limitations on third-party developers for hindering their ability to distribute mobile games and compete effectively with iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iJJVIt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple called the report “seriously flawed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBAsdA"&gt;Apple rejected the report’s findings. “This Facebook-financed survey from December 2020 was narrowly tailored to give the false impression that there’s little competition on the App Store,” an Apple spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In truth, third-party apps compete with Apple’s apps across every category and enjoy large scale success.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXdn9R"&gt;The spokesperson said the survey’s methodology was “seriously flawed in a number of ways” and that the results contradicted Comscore’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings#tab_mobile_apps/"&gt;April 2021 rankings&lt;/a&gt; on app usage. But those rankings didn't attempt to factor in the usage of all preinstalled apps like the Facebook-commissioned study did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVl9oD"&gt;Google did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MknSY7"&gt;Besides Comscore showing app usage in the US for a particular window of time, there are a couple of other quirks in its methodology to note: it did not include browsers such as Apple’s Safari or Google’s Chrome in the rankings or what it calls “embedded operating system features” like Siri. And results for Android weren’t gathered by specific phone manufacturers, meaning app usage isn’t broken out for Samsung phones relative to the Google Pixel, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="05S9u9"&gt;Still, the report points to the power platform owners have over what apps are used on their devices. It’s not just the app stores that serve as gatekeepers, but the phones themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
