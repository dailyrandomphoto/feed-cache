    <title>Apple announces $29 AirTag, a new Tile-like item tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dVKWehDNWYWp3kjdEXvEtfrGWhM=/0x0:2142x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157033/airtag.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j8KDpM"&gt;Apple is officially launching a Tile-like item tracker that will work with the company’s software and services. Dubbed AirTag, the small circular tag will allow you to track items within Apple’s “Find My” app on iOS. Much like Tile, Apple’s AirTags will be useful for tracking items like keys or wallets, and you’ll be provided with notifications when you’re separated from your item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFHPxJ"&gt;The AirTag itself is a small puck-like device that includes a built-in speaker, accelerometer, Bluetooth LE, and a user-replaceable battery. Apple says the tracker should last for a year of battery life, and you can use an NFC tap to activate a lost mode. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Co3luD8e5pkvGFCzcC1RfxhbWE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457308/yJBAy1w.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTag accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NxdYxs"&gt;AirTag will be available for $29 on April 30th, or $99 for a four-pack of the devices. Apple is also working with accessory makers to create luggage tag and keyring enclosures for the AirTag itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuC1qU"&gt;Details about AirTags first appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841204/ios13-code-apple-tile-location-tracking-tag-find-my-app"&gt;copies of the iOS 13 beta&lt;/a&gt; nearly two years ago, and the AirTags name was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936650/apple-airtag-tile-device-reference-ios-13-2-rumors"&gt;spotted in iOS 13.2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;confirmed the AirTags name&lt;/a&gt; in a deleted support video last year, too. Following the rumors, it has taken Apple a considerable amount of time to make AirTags a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rdhx1a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;First rumored in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XUpJWs"&gt;Apple will clearly be competing with Tile with its AirTags, but the location-tracking company has been attempting to embed its technology directly into Bluetooth chips in recent years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/7/18168760/tile-bluetooth-low-energy-item-tracking-ces-2019"&gt;Tile has previously teamed up with&lt;/a&gt; Qualcomm, Dialog Semiconductor, Silicon Labs, and Toshiba to include Tile compatibility as an option on devices. Tile has also embedded its location-tracking network into gadgets from Boosted and Bose, and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;prepping its own AirTags competitor&lt;/a&gt; that could let you find lost items through walls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/42-pjBPrigLZ-EV_VW5rwDUSutY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457331/airtagaccessories.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirTag accessories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3aySXB"&gt;Apple will certainly face some competition from Tile’s broader reach here, but the deeper integration with iOS and iPhones will be a significant challenge for Tile and other competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung’s $29.99 Galaxy SmartTags&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s launch of AirTags comes nearly a year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274709/apple-tile-european-commission-eu-complaint-app-store-iphone-response"&gt;Tile filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the European Commission, accusing Apple of anti-competitive behavior. Tile argues that Apple’s iOS 13.5 update to Bluetooth settings has disadvantaged third-party tracking products in favor of Apple’s own Find My app that doesn’t include the same restrictions by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5u240W"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274709/apple-tile-european-commission-eu-complaint-app-store-iphone-response"&gt;strenuously denied the allegations&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;opened up its Find My app&lt;/a&gt; to third-party products recently. Devices will need to play by Apple’s Made for iPhone (MFi) accessory rules, so companies will need to apply to get certified and have their products tracked in the Find My app. Apple is also offering a chipset specification for third-parties to integrate with the Ultra-Wideband found in Apple’s latest iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBhH4T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22148310"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apple “Spring Loaded” live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Podcasts launches in-app subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUkdS-EhgNsYCMxUhIGKAH5uGcw=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157017/download.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U3LDqi"&gt;A monumental change is coming to Apple Podcasts’ business: the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22381980%2Fapple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is launching subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; within the Apple Podcasts app. During its spring event today, the company announced that people will be able to subscribe to content from the app for extra perks, like ad-free and bonus content, as well as early access. It’ll launch in 170 regions and countries next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfFnbY"&gt;Initial partners include Pushkin Industries, QCODE, and NPR. It appears that content creators will have to pay Apple $19.99 per year in order to offer subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaGaD2"&gt;Apple has mostly, up until now, focused its podcast efforts on creating RSS-based companion shows for its TV Plus and Books content. This move suggests the company sees an opportunity for subscriptions, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yXRzM"&gt;The app is also getting a redesign with channels to help people find new content from their favorite creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1ulR7"&gt;Apple has, for years, been the de facto platform on which people listen to podcasts, partially because of its pre-installation on iPhones. That is, up until Spotify entered the fold in earnest in 2019. Since then, the company has been gunning for Apple’s market share, bolstered by flashy exclusive deals, acquisitions, and the company’s own podcast creation software funnel. The strategy appears to be working. eMarketer reported last month that this year, 28.2 million people will listen to podcasts in the US on Spotify versus Apple Podcasts’ 28 million. A separate report from Voxnest &lt;a href="https://blog.voxnest.com/apple-spotify-podcast-listeners-q1/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; also found Spotify gaining ground in the US, specifically in New Jersey and California where it says the player has overtaken Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9pBV8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22148310"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apple “Spring Loaded” live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s ‘Spring Loaded’ iPad Pro event live blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAeLIPlj1WB0iNe2iu2C-XBLpJA=/0x197:2040x1557/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69156579/springblack3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;iPads? AirTags? AirPods? There could be a lot on tap today&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="t9GFfK"&gt;Apple seemingly has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;big backlog of products to announce&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been anticipating new iPad Pros, AirTags, AirPods, an Apple TV, and just maybe a new iMac with Arm-based Apple Silicon. The tagline for today’s event, “Spring Loaded,” seems to be a hint that today’s live stream will be chock-full of new stuff. All signs, however, point to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;new iPad Pros being the star of the show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuMEtV"&gt;And it might not be just hardware. Apple is increasingly pushing its own services. Perhaps there will be more on tap today to fill out its Apple One bundle. Obvious candidates are some kind of premium podcast option or maybe even an HD option for Apple Music, but the Apple TV Plus service could also stand to get some more premiere content and today’s stream might be a good place to announce it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxVehb"&gt;There are a lot of possibilities, but only Apple knows which of them it’s choosing for this “loaded” live stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJVVpE"&gt;We hope to find out ourselves soon. The event kicks off at 10AM PT / 1PM ET, and we’ll be live-blogging all of the announcements from the live stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJt1Gk"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/13709/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s ‘Spring Loaded’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Spring Loaded 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0k56xFYkqYklvP154YETbB7r5PI=/0x0:1770x1180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154983/appleinvite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d7b3MP"&gt;Whenever Apple decides to schedule an event, you know there are going to be some interesting products introduced, with at least one major device taking center stage and perhaps one or two surprise entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmxQwt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;Current rumors&lt;/a&gt; have Apple introducing 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, the latter with Apple’s first Mini LED display. There may also be a new Apple Pencil stylus to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gb8Fz"&gt;What else? We could see Apple’s long-awaited AirTags, device trackers that are set to go up against Tile, the current leader in that particular market. There is the possibility of a new iPod Mini, a third-generation version of the AirPods, a new model of the Apple TV (which was released in 2017), and the official release of iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ksWii"&gt;Anything more? Well, that’s always a possibility. Be here at 1PM ET and find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIVuhB"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE APPLE “SPRING LOADED” EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You’ll have to tune into the live stream, which starts at 10AM PT / 1PM ET today, Tuesday, April 20th. The event will likely be available to watch again after it concludes, so you’re not stuck if you miss out on the debut stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH THE APPLE EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XbxczI"&gt;As always, Apple is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22385720%2Fapple-event-watch-live-stream-date-start-time-spring-loaded" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting the stream on its site&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, it’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M"&gt;streaming on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. The YouTube stream is embedded up at the top, so feel free to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now the iPad Pro has to live up to the MacBook Air</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ieBVdecSxfGIePzeEQUaafZbPbw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154867/vpavic_042018_3979_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jyIXlW"&gt;Today, we’re expecting a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;grab bag of new products from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, headlined by new iPad Pros. Given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;relatively minor spec bumps&lt;/a&gt; that we got on last year’s iPad Pros, this time around, we’re hoping for a more substantial update. In some ways, it seems likely that Apple will deliver, at least with the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXIPct"&gt;I’m sure the specs will be impressive. But after the release of the first MacBooks with Apple’s own M1 Arm-based silicon, there’s a strange inversion happening. Before, we’d look at a MacBook and wonder why it can’t have the power and battery life of an iPad. Now, I think more and more people are going to join me in looking at the iPad and wondering why it can’t have the flexibility and power of a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTUUhc"&gt;In short, Apple’s silicon didn’t just catch the Mac up to the iPad; it catapulted the Mac beyond the iPad. The M1 MacBook Air is fast, responsive, has no fan, runs any Mac app I throw at it (including Intel apps) very quickly, and even can run some iPad apps (though that experiment isn’t going super well). It is easily the best general purpose laptop I’ve used in half a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TMsmhs"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="M1 MacBook Pro and Air review: Apple delivers|96773" data-volume-uuid="6412f55d2" data-volume-id="96773" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-255" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6qESXR"&gt;That big of a leap can’t help but recast the iPad’s development over the years. As just one data point, I’ve used both iPad Pros and M1-based MacBooks as my daily work computer, and the MacBook Air has better battery life. An iPad can last for days and days if you just use it for tablet tasks. But log in to all your stuff and run it all day like you do your laptop, and it’ll conk out a few hours short of the MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofl5N7"&gt;From one perspective, I get that it’s silly to just one-to-one compare the iPad and Mac. The iPad is more flexible in its hardware: you can sit on the couch with it, you can use a stylus with it, attach a keyboard, and — get this — touch the screen. When I speak to Apple executives, they express little of the Mac versus iPad angst I see online (and feel myself). Nobody’s actually confused between these two devices, they argue, and I believe it. One of my core beliefs about consumer technology is that consumers are savvier and smarter than they usually get credit for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH5OBQ"&gt;That savvy cuts both ways, though. Because from the other perspective, everybody is capable of just looking at each computer’s capabilities and seeing that the Mac can just do &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not quite true that the iPad’s functionality is merely a subset of the Mac’s, but in the Venn diagram of the two, the iPad-only part of the circle isn’t very big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvAvdD"&gt;Another way of looking at it is this: it used to be that you would go for the iPad because the MacBook was just fundamentally worse at a few things like speed and battery life. Now that we have MacBooks with Apple Silicon, that list is significantly shorter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtA7L6"&gt;Can the iPad Pro jump back ahead through purely hardware specs? It’d be tough. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;Mark Gurman at &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the iPad Pro is supposed to get an “updated processor that is on par with the faster M1 chip in the latest MacBook Air.” There are significant differences between how Apple puts together iOS chips and MacBook chips, but let’s just assume it’s easy to compare and the iPad gets faster. So what? Apple has the enviable problem right now of having computers that are more than fast enough for the vast majority of people. I don’t know anybody who’s actually complaining about the iPad Pro’s speed or graphical capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiFoCg"&gt;New cameras? Sure. LIDAR? I remain unconvinced it’s a must-have feature for anybody. The one thing that might matter is the rumored fancy new Mini LED screen technology on the larger iPad Pro. That will make it look more like a high-end TV, with brighter brights and blacker blacks. One of the best things to do on an iPad is watch video, and so it might convince some people to upgrade just for the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcJI5p"&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;review of the M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, I called it a “triumph” and was seriously considering giving it a perfect score until I saw how dumpy the webcam still is. That’s one place where the iPad has a much better spec: the iPad Pro’s front-facing camera is excellent. It’s also in the wrong place, on the side when you use it horizontally instead of on the top. That’s the iPad Pro in a microcosm: stupefyingly good hardware with some stupid limitations in how Apple expects it to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WdmW7j"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPadOS review: sounds like a computer to me|73038" data-volume-uuid="74dee35c2" data-volume-id="73038" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-907" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xkDgAY"&gt;The story with the iPad — and especially the iPad Pro — since before Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18103515/ipad-pro-replace-your-computer-ad-apple"&gt;2018 “What’s a computer” TV ad&lt;/a&gt; has been the same. Can its iOS-based software be opened up and extended enough to allow both developers and users to get it to do the things they want. Apple made a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20898883/ipados-review-13-apple-features-multitasking-sidecar-browser-bugs-computer"&gt;huge step in that direction with iPadOS in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s still a long way to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irArMx"&gt;Today’s iPad Pros are likely to be amazing feats of technology, but the really important iPad announcement will come this summer at WWDC when Apple will unveil its plans for iPadOS. Right now, I use the iPad Pro every day but mostly as a Sidecar display for my MacBook. It’s just much more useful as a Mac screen than it is as an iPad screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvOPiu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoCIfv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Companies can’t wait to accessorize your AirTags</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBay listings show accessories to attach the trackers to a key chain.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/402768710040?mkevt=1&amp;amp;mkcid=1&amp;amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;amp;campid=5336804442&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;customid=73726X1523000X489fcde28fe469d4e72e66a74e5dbad1" target="_blank"&gt;ta9146 / eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQ4THZ"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored AirTags trackers could launch alongside a wide array of third-party accessories, if retailer listings and leaked photos &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/third-party-airtags-accessories/"&gt;pulled together by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are accurate. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F402768710040&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393404%2Fairtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F985731193%2Fleather-airtags-cover-airtags-cases&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393404%2Fairtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; sellers, and even &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fankishi-Bluetooth-Tracker-Cover-Bluetooth-Finder-Case-for-Airtags%2F490638502&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, are already selling keychains to attach the trackers to a set of keys. Images of apparent silicone straps have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1384320511824437248"&gt;also leaked&lt;/a&gt;, showing how the trackers could be strapped to bigger items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxTkXP"&gt;After being rumored for over a year, Apple’s Tile-like trackers are widely expected to be officially announced later today at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;Spring Loaded event&lt;/a&gt;. Reports indicate the trackers themselves will be small discs equipped with Bluetooth and ultra-wideband radio chips, which users can track with Apple’s Find My app. At this point they’ve been leaked basically everywhere: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841204/ios13-code-apple-tile-location-tracking-tag-find-my-app"&gt;iOS code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142249/apple-tags-iphone-kuo-location-tracking"&gt;analyst reports&lt;/a&gt;, and even a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;support video&lt;/a&gt; from Apple.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xd8yq1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AirTags third-party accessories are already ready. &lt;a href="https://t.co/lvv1elJ6iY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lvv1elJ6iY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DuanRui (@duanrui1205) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1384320511824437248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0HGDQC"&gt;While there’s no guarantee that these accessory manufacturers are working off official information supplied by Apple, these leaks give a good indication of how they plan on supporting the trackers once they’re official. They follow earlier leaks from January about AirTags accessories from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/accessory-makers-preparing-for-airtags-launch/"&gt;Nomad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/spigen-airtags-accessory-for-late-october-release/"&gt;Spigen sub-brand Cyrill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Iuf7"&gt;Apple’s approach to attaching AirTags to your personal belongings is different from Tile, its main competitor in the space. Tile produces trackers in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20901686/tile-tracker-mate-pro-slim-sticker-release-date-news-features"&gt;variety of different form-factors&lt;/a&gt; depending on what they’re designed to track, whether it’s a credit card shaped device for a wallet, or a tracker with a hole that’s designed to go on a keychain. In contrast, Apple seems to be producing just a single form-factor, and relying on accessories to attach it to your belongings. It’s an interesting difference that might make Apple’s trackers more versatile, albeit slightly worse tailored to some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2JUZE"&gt;Apple’s Spring Loaded event is due to take place later today at 1pm ET, where the AirTags are expected to be announced alongside the company’s new iPad Pro lineup and more. You’ll be able to watch along live on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393404%2Fairtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Event website&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBYVNuky1M"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds Pac-Man, Hello Kitty, Gundam mechs, and more to AR search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSry71UehtkravCv4F8zsfnc5n4=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154559/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_14.42.54.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XhwWeH"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/japanese-characters-ar/"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of popular Japanese characters to its AR feature in mobile search, which has previously featured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22171601/google-adds-augmented-reality-ar-animals-search-3d"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400577/google-arts-and-culture-augmented-reality-prehistoric-creatures-museum-exhibits"&gt;historical artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308071/google-search-augmented-reality-animals-dinosaurs-tyrannosaurus-rex-velociraptor-triceratops"&gt;dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;. The list of characters is taken from Japanese pop culture including anime, TV, and video games, with names like Pac-Man, Hello Kitty, mechs from Evangelion and Gundam, and more. The feature works on Google search on Android and the iOS Google app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZPAyI"&gt;When you enter the characters’ names, you’ll see an option to “see in your space” below the main search result, and that’ll let you drop a 3D model into your camera view. The models can appear at various degrees of scale, with an option to render at life size, though I’m not sure quite how accurate those measurements are. I was under the impression that Hello Kitty was five apples tall, for example, but she towered over my desk when I tried it out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZWUeQCTnyOqYovKVVuZ75ZcySc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456500/AR_Anime_EN.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rsGC8u"&gt;The full list of characters is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mFnxoh"&gt;Ultraman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wgSY13"&gt;Ultraman Zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ekhymm"&gt;Ultraman Belial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N2dwUs"&gt;Gomora&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cemAjs"&gt;Evangelion (EVA-01 Test Type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Li0tRu"&gt;Gundam (Odysseus Gundam, Xi Gundam, Penelope)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R9NXaz"&gt;Cogimyun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8eVr2V"&gt;The drums from &lt;em&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1zvXYs"&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6heNrj"&gt;Pompompurin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0S44KJ"&gt;Little Twin Stars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mXYV1I"&gt;Google says that Pac-Man is by far the most searched-for character out of the list, with more than twice as many searches as for Hello Kitty at #2. Apparently, the top country for Pac-Man searches is Peru.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler will relaunch on Apple’s App Store next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Parler logo is seen behind a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1cz50eEVSzl-LzVPheLh799FFrs=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69152391/1230591907.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Thiago Prudêncio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwqCuM"&gt;The embattled social network Parler is slated to reappear on iOS on the week of April 26th, following its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391943/apple-parler-app-store-lawmakers-hearing-google-play"&gt;re-acceptance into Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. However, the iOS app will block some content that’s available on the Android and web versions of Parler — a compromise that apparently satisfies Apple’s developer guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdlQdH"&gt;Parler announced the news in a press release. Interim CEO Mark Meckler said the company had “worked to put in place systems that will better detect unlawful speech and allow users to filter content undesirable to them, while maintaining our strict prohibition against content moderation based on viewpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ymeJ98"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple reversed its ban earlier today&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tzQTy2"&gt;Apple reaccepted Parler after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324028/apple-parler-app-store-ban-upheld-nazi-symbols"&gt;months-long ban&lt;/a&gt; under pressure from lawmakers, two days before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376127/apple-senate-judiciary-hearing-klobuchar-app-store-google-play-antitrust"&gt;a hearing on Apple’s App Store policies&lt;/a&gt;. The company said Parler — which promotes itself as a less strictly moderated alternative to Facebook or Twitter — had engaged in “substantial conversations” with Apple, resulting in a set of proposed changes that would meet Apple’s content policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzrKz1"&gt;According to Parler’s press release, that includes filtering some content on iOS. “While the App Store version of Parler will prohibit some posts that Parler allows, those posts will still remain visible on the web-based and Android versions of Parler,” the release notes. Parler didn’t elaborate on what kinds of content that would include, but Apple broadly requires a system for filtering “objectionable” material posted by users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueCEao"&gt;Apple, Google, and Amazon all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;banned Parler&lt;/a&gt; after the January 6th attack on the US Capitol, saying Parler had failed to police violent threats and hateful content. Parler sued Amazon, which it had worked with for web hosting, but the suit has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;so far fared poorly&lt;/a&gt; in court. Google has continued to bar Parler from its Play Store, but users can install the app directly on Android — making the ban far less of a liability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xXWN-t57Q2UyqQv662Bj9KonMk=/158x0:1883x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_2021_2.7.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can’t say we like Samsung’s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it’s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is the only small phone on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a step down from the 9 Pro, but it only gives up a few features at a significantly lower price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ofDQRV"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZJWuDD"&gt;If you want an excellent ultrawide camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uUgURs"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is the step-down model from the OnePlus 9 Pro, which is itself an excellent phone. But you don’t give up too much by opting for the 9, and you save a ton of money. Like the 9 Pro, it offers great performance with a Snapdragon 888 processor, fast 65W wired charging, and something that will appeal especially to the landscape photographers out there: a great ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2S7w"&gt;The sensor behind the OnePlus 9’s ultrawide camera is physically larger than most and offers a healthy 50-megapixel resolution. A unique lens design corrects distortion without introducing the funhouse mirror-type stretching you’ll often see in the corners of ultrawide images. And if super-wide photography isn’t your thing, know that the main camera turns in solid image quality, too. Images are well-exposed, and colors look pleasantly vibrant. OnePlus makes a big deal of the Hasselblad color science at work here, which does a fine job but isn’t as mind-blowingly good as the company suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O804KE"&gt;Unfortunately, you do miss out on a couple of good camera features opting for the 9 rather than the 9 Pro. The main camera on the 9 Pro offers optical image stabilization, which isn’t included on the 9, and is useful for its ability to keep subjects looking sharp in lower light conditions. There’s also no telephoto lens — just digital zoom, which isn’t as good as the 9 Pro’s optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The OnePlus 9 also doesn’t work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. (It works on both T-Mobile and Verizon’s 5G networks, however.) That’s no great loss right now (honestly, it might be for the better), but in a couple of years, this will probably become a downside. Bearing this in mind and a couple of camera feature omissions, the OnePlus 9 is an excellent device. It offers a flagship feel and performance for a bit less than the highest-end Android options and a seriously good ultrawide camera for wide-angle photo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best cheap phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4WMzav"&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A 5G starts at $500 and gets you access to several key features: a big-ish 6.2-inch screen, clean and uncluttered Android software, Google’s excellent Pixel camera, and of course 5G. Although buying a phone &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to get 5G is a mistake, all things being equal, it’s worth getting 5G if you can in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwyHDO"&gt;Even though the Pixel camera isn’t the very best you can get anymore, it still is competitive with phones that cost hundreds of dollars more. No other phone at this $500 ($600 on Verizon) price point can match the Pixel’s camera quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YRQbD"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a good-looking OLED screen. Just as importantly, it has the promise of getting timely software updates directly from Google. While other Android phones take forever to get the new versions of Android, Google’s get them right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 2 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. Since it debuted for $2,000, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364162/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-price-cut-announced-1800"&gt;permanently marked down by $200&lt;/a&gt;, but you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ulNwuE"&gt;Apple will allow Parler to return to its App Store, according to a letter first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/tech/apple-parler-app-store/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN &lt;/em&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TiBRO"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721?s=20"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), Apple said “Parler has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices” that would bring the app into compliance with the App Store’s rules. Now, Parler is allowed to return once it reintroduces the app to the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="59NFOy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On March 31, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SenMikeLee&lt;/a&gt; and I sent a letter demanding answers about why Apple removed Parler from the App Store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Today, we received a response: Parler will be reinstated on the App Store. Huge win for free speech. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FQBDSSSFGk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FQBDSSSFGk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Congressman Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JKLUfI"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed Parler, a conservative-favored social media app, following accusations that users of the app promoted violence ahead of and after a pro-Trump mob attacked the US Capitol. Before its ban, Apple demanded that Parler remove hateful and violent content from the app within 24 hours in order to remain on the App Store. Parler did not propose any changes, and so it was removed on January 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLzN3z"&gt;Days later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon dropped Parler, too&lt;/a&gt;, citing similar threats of violence. In doing so, Amazon effectively took Parler entirely offline until the site could find a replacement web host. Following Parler’s shutdown, the company’s CEO John Matze &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/973083119/former-parler-ceo-matze-stripped-of-all-company-shares-upon-firing-sources-say"&gt;was fired&lt;/a&gt; from the company and later stripped of all his shares. Parler found a new web host and went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284036/parler-social-network-relaunch-new-hosting"&gt;back online&lt;/a&gt; in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAOjEP"&gt;Apple’s decision to bring back Parler comes just days &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376127/apple-senate-judiciary-hearing-klobuchar-app-store-google-play-antitrust"&gt;before the company&lt;/a&gt; is set to testify before Congress regarding its App Store practices. Google will also be sending a witness to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378697/apple-witness-senate-judiciary-hearing-antitrust-app-stores"&gt;testify at the hearing&lt;/a&gt; scheduled for Wednesday. Parler isn’t currently distributed on the Google Play Store, and in a statement Monday, Google said it was because Parler has yet to submit changes similar to what they’ve shared with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2P9nxO"&gt;“Parler has remained available on Android because of the openness of the platform even if it isn’t currently distributed through Google Play,” a Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Monday. “As we stated back in January, Parler is welcome back in the Play store once it submits an app that complies with our policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyE5gK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 4/19/21 at 3:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
