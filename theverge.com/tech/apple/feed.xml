    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year — and we’re bound to see far more as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday approach&lt;/a&gt;. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwEyX"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 by $30, bringing the price down to $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $199 instead of $229. Like the 38mm model, it’s also available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-42mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101062" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, though, not at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="title"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version with a silver aluminum case and an abyss blue sport band for $270 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F305879066&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other configurations — as well as the larger, 44mm model with GPS — are currently only available at full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. Right now, for instance, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red variant &lt;/a&gt;at Amazon right now for $349, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm model with GPS is your fancy, it’s available in white, navy, and red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $379, slightly more than its best-ever price. The red configuration is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for the same price, as is the black model at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-44mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band%2F-%2FA-80606297" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hZHCRf"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. There are very few deals to speak of right now, however, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model with a green Sport Band and green aluminum casing for $390 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a $10 discount. The 45mm model with GPS is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in red for $420.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vE4BzP"&gt;Although both deals are slight, it is possible that we’ll see bigger discounts as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday, especially given Amazon has taken between $30 and $40 off a number of different sizes and configurations of the Series 7 in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4m59DD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s unexciting 2021 Mac and iPhone software prove it should take a break from annual OS updates</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZnL4b"&gt;Apple’s fall software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, are officially out in the world for everyone. But Apple’s latest software has arrived with more of a whimper than a bang; the two updates aren’t so much bad as they are &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Which has me wondering: why is Apple still clinging to its annual release schedule at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lXVnu"&gt;There are two problems that Apple’s annual cadence causes. The first, as is the case this year, is that iOS and macOS are increasingly mature operating systems with fewer issues to fix or missing features to add. Which, in turn, means that there are fewer opportunities for sweeping upgrades like there were in the early days when the iPhone getting copy and paste support was headline news. Short of Apple changing its mind about how its operating systems and the rules that govern it work — &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;like when it allowed for third-party email and browser apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;in iOS 14 &lt;/a&gt;— there’s just less room for big additions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s8ks4Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple macOS 12 Monterey review: the best is yet to come","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"},{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pjaj8I"&gt;Second is the fact that — because Apple silos off virtually all its updates, big or small, to help pad out the “big” iOS release — smaller but useful quality of life improvements often get stuck waiting around months for the fall cycle to line up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXjwLc"&gt;Take iOS 15, which added a grid view and the ability to blur a background in FaceTime, core features that have already been a key part of Zoom and Google Meet’s toolkits for making larger virtual conversations more organized. Neither appears to be the kind of earth-shattering, OS-level feature that would require waiting for a new version of iOS, but Apple saved the updates to be part of iOS 15 anyway, despite the fact that they undoubtedly would have been more useful during the height of the pandemic when video chatting was more heavily in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV2Lpr"&gt;Apple has, in fairness, already started to trend away from its one-and-done updates, if only because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;it’s missed its self-imposed deadlines&lt;/a&gt; multiple times. Major features for iOS and macOS like SharePlay or Universal Control have been delayed from the initial dot-zero builds for more development time. Point releases have gotten more and more important, too, used to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936510/apple-ios-13-2-airpods-pro-compatible"&gt;debut new emoji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265019/apple-ios-13-5-out-now-unlock-iphone-face-mask-id-exposure-notification-covid-19"&gt;critical Face ID updates for better mask support&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;Apple’s high-profile App Tracking Transparency requirement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MNSTz5"&gt;To solve the issues of lackluster annual updates, Apple should do two things. First, it should continue to build out point releases with additional features throughout the year or even unbundle app updates from its annual releases entirely. Did the FaceTime team come up with a great new feature that’ll make pandemic chatting easier? Release it when it’s ready! Second, it should start to space out its major software releases, waiting an extra year or two between iOS or macOS versions to ensure that when it does release a “new” operating system, there are actually big changes to be excited about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzPZiA"&gt;Spaced out software updates wouldn’t even be a new idea for Apple, at least on the macOS side of things. Apple spent almost a decade spacing out OS X releases every two years before it brought back annual releases with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mZbllQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spaced out updates aren’t a new idea for Apple, either&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxo47T"&gt;Sure, Apple does get some benefit from its current cadence. On a basic level, bundling iOS and macOS updates gives Apple a single, cohesive marketing push, a package of features that it can point to and say, “Look, here are all the ways the new software makes your life better.” The annual releases also mean that Apple can count on journalists writing roundups of the new features every year at WWDC and reviews of those new features in the fall, and Apple might have to risk that consistent coverage if it changes things up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j59DEI"&gt;But while the boosted public awareness is nice, I doubt that Apple would be missing out on much if it spaced out annual releases. New iPhones are not sold on the strength of having Apple’s new software installed; customers praised the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Airs&lt;/a&gt; because of their battery life and processing speed, not because they shipped with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck9iBC"&gt;People install iOS and macOS updates, but outside of the tech sphere, it’s not something that people are &lt;em&gt;eager&lt;/em&gt; to do. More often than not, Apple updates are installed out of a grudging frustration at push notifications and a desire to banish alert bubbles, not because Focus modes allow power users to set up more granular do-not-disturb settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1NH9kX03zjMNoq8Xubjz6hdSLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864029/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wl2uuH"&gt;Spacing out iOS and macOS updates for when Apple actually has big marquee features to show off (like it did during the OS X days when it actually &lt;em&gt;charged&lt;/em&gt; for new updates) could go a long way to fixing that unenthusiastic update cycle. Less frequent iOS updates could help make sure that there’s actually something to get excited for, like a new visual design or substantial new features (like Siri). Additionally, Apple would get more time to develop new versions of its software, which could theoretically cut down on the bugs and glitches in the final versions of whatever it does ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Crtfgq"&gt;Smaller updates, meanwhile, can be doled out over the year when they’re ready, instead of waiting to cluster every minor update into a massive, overwhelming grab bag once a year where they’re more likely to be overshadowed anyway by the more substantial parts of the new operating system. More gradual updates that aren’t tied to a single major release is an idea we know works, too, because it’s how every other third-party app on iOS already handles updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0w6US"&gt;But right now, Apple’s system of annual releases leaves it with the worst of both worlds: siloed updates that come too infrequently for minor features while still not having enough major features to be worth the hype. If Apple can’t make macOS and iOS updates more substantial, it might be time to leave the annual release cycle behind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Apple Pay and Touch ID on an external Magic Keyboard can get complicated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nVWK2Xsofm63cVZz5P5ibWwItNE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129372/akrales_20210515_4583_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mropuN"&gt;Publications like &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/11/apple-pay-doesnt-work-on-your-magic-keyboard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported some odd behavior when trying to use Apple’s Magic Keyboard with Touch ID to authenticate for Apple Pay — specifically, that it won’t work if you’re trying to do it with a MacBook that has its display closed, as it would be while running it in “clamshell mode” hooked up to an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECgIvc"&gt;Obviously, when the MacBook’s lid is closed, you can’t use the built-in Touch ID sensor, so it’s easy to see how this limitation was put in place. But in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Apple sells an external keyboard with the sensor&lt;/a&gt; (starting at &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK293LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english"&gt;an eye-watering $150&lt;/a&gt;), it’s an awkward limitation. That’s especially true given that the keyboard’s Touch ID functionality only works with Apple Silicon-powered Macs and comes with all but the base-level iMac. That means that most of the people buying it will likely be laptop users looking for a way to type while their laptop is docked (maybe even with the screen closed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rYYp5l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If it’s safe enough for an M1 Mac Mini, it’s safe enough for a docked MacBook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fiiiec"&gt;Hopefully Apple will let its users make payments with their external keyboard soon, no matter what the state of their laptop’s lid is. It’s understandable that Apple wants to make sure that payment authentication is a secure process — &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;’s article&lt;/a&gt; mentions a load of other security settings that can affect being able to use Touch ID with Apple Pay — but if it’s safe enough to use with the M1 Mac Mini, it should be safe enough to use with a docked laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6CIcJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated November 11th, 4:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that this behavior appears to be intentional, rather than a bug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS beta blurs nude images for children using Messages app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ZZ1sPIkrsfwTYCTNkf1mYR8iPw=/0x1:920x614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70126082/child_safety__cemgn2jzflqq_large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promotional images of the feature released earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mnUVnE"&gt;iOS 15.2’s latest beta adds an Apple Communication Safety feature to the Messages app, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The opt-in feature is designed to protect children from inappropriate imagery by scanning incoming and outgoing pictures for “sexually explicit” material. Any images meeting this description are blurred, and the child will be warned about its contents and told it’s ok not to view it. The feature, which ties into Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201060"&gt;existing Family Sharing system&lt;/a&gt;, is also designed to offer resources to affected children for them to get help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGXNnV"&gt;The version of the feature that’s released in iOS 15.2’s latest beta has one crucial difference from what Apple originally announced in August: it won’t send notifications to parents if a child decides to view a sexually explicit image. Critics like Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic instructor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423365222841135114"&gt;Kendra Albert&lt;/a&gt; objected to this element in particular because it could out queer or transgender children to their parents. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; also notes that in its original form, the feature could have introduced safety issues when a parent is violent or abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zJmBEN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xmUOH6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-to-beta-test-imessage-feature-that-warns-kids-about-nude-imagery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that children will instead have the choice of whether to alert someone they trust about a flagged photo, and that this choice is separate from the choice of whether to unblur and view the image. Checks are carried out on-device, and do not impact end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nie4hK"&gt;The Communication Safety feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;originally announced in August&lt;/a&gt; as part of a trio of features designed to protect children from sexual abuse. However, the company said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delaying the introduction of the features the following month&lt;/a&gt; in response to objections raised by privacy advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMjijr"&gt;Communication Safety is distinct from the CSAM-detection (child sexual abuse imagery detection) feature that scans a user’s iCloud Photos and reports offending content to Apple moderators, and which generated the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;bulk of the outcry from privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an update coming to Siri search that’s designed to offer resources if a user searches for topics relating to child sexual abuse. It’s currently unclear when these two features are planned for release, and there haven’t been reports of them appearing in Apple’s public beta software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcRKjg"&gt;It’s worth noting that features added to iOS 15.2’s latest beta could still change dramatically before its official release, and it may be removed from the update entirely. Other new features that have arrived in the latest beta include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774124/ios-15-2-beta-2-airtag-tracker-scan-privacy-invasion"&gt;manual AirTag scanning feature&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;pass on your iCloud data to a loved one&lt;/a&gt; in the case of your death.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iCloud for Windows gets a built in password generator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTR8LPK4HIUJA_zKsdOu1Co9xHE=/1x0:1198x798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125933/2021_11_10_18_45_58_Microsoft_Store.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud for Windows’ password manager in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: iCloud for Windows&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2sLgL"&gt;A new update for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Ficloud%2F9pktq5699m62%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s iCloud Windows app&lt;/a&gt; has added a password generator, as well as support for Apple’s ProRaw and ProRes photo and video formats to the cloud storage utility. The update, which was first &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/10/icloud-windows-13/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also adds the ability for participants of a shared iCloud Drive file or folder to add or remove other users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fF7JP0"&gt;The addition of a password generator makes Apple’s iCloud keychain a much more viable cross-platform password manager. It follows an update in August which &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3629310/apple-brings-icloud-passwords-to-windows-microsofts-edge.html"&gt;allowed Windows users to access&lt;/a&gt; (but not generate) passwords from their iCloud account. Together with the &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3605098/icloud-passwords-are-coming-to-chrome-for-windows.html"&gt;Chrome iCloud extension&lt;/a&gt; Apple released at the beginning of the year, Windows iCloud users now have access to basic password management features when they’re away from their Apple device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WzA8Mz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plus new options to remove other users from shared files&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QpS9fs"&gt;Given the option, I’d personally still recommend that anyone looking for a password manager opt for a true platform-agnostic alternative. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;I recommend Bitwarden as the best free option&lt;/a&gt;, because as well as being available on Mac, iOS, and Windows, it’s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; available on Android, so you’re not locked in to Apple’s mobile platform if you want to switch in future. But using iCloud Keychain is better than not using a password manager at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GmrpN"&gt;Meanwhile, the addition of ProRes and ProRaw support is useful given that the latest iPhones are now capable of shooting in both formats. Making it easier to sync these with your Windows PC should be useful if you want to view them, or more likely edit them, on a Windows machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge buys Rittenhouse lawyer’s inane argument that Apple’s pinch-to-zoom manipulates footage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Trial Continues In Kenosha, WI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zDVoE_-vlqC4mlIOTgC89V94i-Q=/0x0:5043x3362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125363/1236486033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Krajacic-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vmv9F2"&gt;As Kyle Rittenhouse took the stand to answer questions about the sequence of events before he shot and killed a man in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the jury was forced to watch the video evidence play out in miniature — because Rittenhouse’s defense lawyer came up with the wild notion that Apple has “artificial intelligence” that manipulates footage when you pinch-to-zoom on an iPad, and Judge Bruce Schroeder totally bought into that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="raJUzK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The word he’s looking for is algorithms, but that’s beside the point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYw2Ho"&gt;“iPads, which are made by Apple, have artificial intelligence in them that allow things to be viewed through three-dimensions and logarithms,” the defense insisted. “It uses artificial intelligence, or their logarithms, to create what they believe is happening. So this isn’t actually enhanced video, this is Apple’s iPad programming creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltjm5U"&gt;While it’s unclear from a full video of the proceedings (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIzj48oL6T0&amp;amp;t=18145s"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) whether the judge actually prohibited the prosecution from using an iOS device or otherwise zooming into the footage, the result was the same: instead of using an iPad, the jury wound up watching the original, zoomed-out clips on a Windows machine hooked up to a large TV in the courtroom. The images didn’t fill the TV’s entire screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WuBA4y4JkmyBJzK_40Pt0j2In-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004713/image__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the first video clips Rittenhouse was questioned about, as presented to the jury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9zoKjo"&gt;Judge Schroeder argued that it was the prosecution — not the defense — that had the burden of proving that Apple &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; use artificial intelligence to manipulate footage, demanding that they provide an expert to testify, and didn’t allow the prosecution to adjourn to find that expert before bringing Rittenhouse up for cross-examination. The judge suggested that prosecutors could somehow find that expert in 20 minutes while they took a brief recess. “Maybe you can get someone to testify on this within minutes, I don’t know,” said the judge. No such expert was there by the time the trial resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dD9xmb"&gt;While the nature of reality with regards to digital images is thorny when it comes to things like color, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling"&gt;digital image scaling&lt;/a&gt; is fairly well understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GflCas"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/kyle-rittenhouse-charges.html"&gt;six criminal charges&lt;/a&gt; against Rittenhouse in connection to the shooting in Kenosha. He’s accused of killing two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3Iuii"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail’s upcoming iOS widget could actually be useful</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EY5kSu3I_3iWhioAyqtaA8cXnPs=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125299/gmail_widget.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BCy6If"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/stay-productive-these-google-features-ios/"&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s updating the Gmail iOS widget with a new one that’s actually useful, showing you the subjects and senders of the emails sitting in your inbox. The company says the new widget will be “launching in the next few weeks,” to replace the previous version that wasn’t particularly well-received. This also means that, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/10/gmail-ios-widget-meet-sheets/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, this means that Gmail’s iOS widget will have the same functionality as the current Android one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5lXgJ"&gt;When the first version of the Gmail widget launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574112/google-new-gmail-widget-ios-14-limitations"&gt;we pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that it isn’t particularly helpful. It really only provides shortcuts to different screens on the app like your inbox and the email composer. Critically, it doesn’t actually show you much information about the emails you’ve received, though it does tell you how many are sitting unread in your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14nvlngEXOqt5quLjsKEo8_jzg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004270/Old_Widget.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old widget can only take to to the app’s search, compose, and inbox screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VCvrrd"&gt;Part of the old widget’s lack of functionality was due to Apple’s limitations. You’re currently not allowed to build interactivity into your widget, and any tapping the user does has to be handled by launching the app. Those rules haven’t substantially changed since the first widget was introduced, but the new design shows that there’s still room for useful information. You may not be able to archive an email from your home screen, for example, but you’ll at least be able to get a feel for what’s waiting in your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df821sd9pAlX_97Fz1mqYrEM-wY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004197/Sheets_Keyboardshortcuts.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google also says it’s updating Google Sheets’ keyboard shortcut support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s05ZO5"&gt;Google also announced other upcoming improvements to its apps that could be useful for heavy users of its services. Meet (it’s business-focused video chat app) is getting support for iOS’s picture-in-picture feature, so you can still see your co-workers or the presentation while you switch apps to check on a file or email. Google also says it’ll expand the keyboard shortcuts available for people who use Google Sheets with an external keyboard (including Apple’s Magic Keyboard case).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will soon let you pass on your iCloud data when you die </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oBZI9ivVRiNFnV9ZrEB2Al6OUiE=/375x0:4422x2698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123890/Claim_Request___iPad.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Digital Legacy program lets users choose up to five people who can access their iCloud account when they pass away.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xZ0p1D"&gt;Apple is solving a complicated problem with its latest iOS update: right of survivorship. Until now, when a loved one or family member dies, there was no easy way to access their iCloud account and absolutely no way of unlocking their phone without knowing their passcode. According to the&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/legal/internet-services/icloud/en/terms.html"&gt; iCloud terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, the deceased person’s data goes with them even with a death certificate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0yJO5"&gt;With the new Digital Legacy program, first announced at &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__youtu.be_0TD96VTf0Xs-3Ft-3D3250&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=HTakECkqD13F_4No8TePr7snOg-TM_Z0bAqwspVK1Ig&amp;amp;m=fItzX2rODQv7RTBNSewxVHMkya7KOGU1oXhxAzEMZPr6hl7x3l__BXbSpMvo-Oet&amp;amp;s=C1TZjvKT6GLXL0Ujl0iCXyP3v_KcOvP9Mlxi4sdZ8NY&amp;amp;e="&gt;WWDC earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; and arriving in iOS 15.2, you can designate up to five people as Legacy Contacts. These individuals can then access your data and personal information stored in iCloud when you die, such as photos, documents, and even purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTcY2F"&gt;To activate Digital Legacy, Apple still requires proof of death and an access key. Still, it’s a much more simplified process than before, which could require a court order confirming a right to inheritance, and even then, there was no guarantee you would get access to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsBjJm"&gt;This has been a complicated situation for Apple, which has long touted its core principles of protecting users’ privacy. &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/01/technology/leonardo-fabbretti-apple/index.html"&gt;Grieving parents&lt;/a&gt; and spouses railing against the company for not giving them access to their spouses’ photos isn’t a good look. But neither is doling out people’s data willy-nilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OicCfd"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3036546"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/991335594313139"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have systems in place for designating account access to other people, and it’s good to see Apple catching up here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/940cfO0OkQ_5sDIpdxvW-ApWX20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003129/Legacy_Contact_Setup___iPhone.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set up your Legacy Contacts in Settings on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="cGLS0b"&gt;How to set up a Legacy Contact &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="4J6udT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(note you need to be running iOS 15.2 to access this feature)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QNxQyr"&gt;On an iOS device, go to Settings &amp;gt; [your name] &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mLmW5J"&gt;On a Mac, go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oIRNAU"&gt;Under Legacy Contact, follow the instructions to add a Legacy Contact. If you use Family Sharing, you can choose a family member from the list; alternatively, add someone using their email or phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CD5ZzW"&gt;Notify your Legacy Contact and share an access key via Messages. If they accept, a copy of the access key is automatically stored in their Apple ID settings. If they decline, you will receive a notification. The access key is required to get into your account if you pass away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PRSBZY"&gt;While you can add a Legacy Contact who isn’t on iOS 15.2, they won’t be able to store the access key in the settings on their device, so you should provide it to them in another way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uspE8A"&gt;Legacy Contact is part of the Digital Legacy program and is available now in the public beta version of iOS 15.2 for iPhone. It will be broadly accessible when iOS 15.2 fully launches. Apple hasn’t said which version of macOS will support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltlITw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro vs. Pixel 6 Pro: what 2,000 photos tell us</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wh4LrChgh-_HYNao1Gus5lOdFho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121885/BFARSACE_FULLFRAME_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k3ztZx"&gt;When the iPhone 13 Pro launched earlier this fall, we said it had the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;“best camera” in a smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. The larger sensor behind the main wide-angle lens coupled with a wider f/1.5 aperture left us saying, “Whoa, look at this photo,” more often than we were used to. But a few weeks later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, with its 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images, was finally released, proving a worthy competitor for the iPhone 13 Pro’s 12-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-51a5mInUeU_ZboyZk_s8FIAOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863264/akrales_210917_4760_0441.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4yJQvkwWefcAyltTUEaEUkUjOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957778/akrales_211020_4802_0710.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro has a massive 6.7-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ty7jhO"&gt;So this year, in order to settle the score, I set out to take 1,000 photos on each device. I carried them everywhere, annoyed all of my friends by stopping to take photos every other minute, and was ultimately left with a vast range of situations and lighting conditions to compare the photos from these two cameras. Initially, I thought a winner would become obvious around the 200-photo mark, but I quickly realized using these devices was about far more than their end products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ydCHj"&gt;Tune in to my video above, from my camera series &lt;em&gt;Full Frame&lt;/em&gt;, to see what phone ultimately took the gold. Or visit the &lt;a href="https://adobe.ly/3mFzayJ"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro’s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://adobe.ly/3qscBzQ"&gt;Google Pixel 6 Pro’s&lt;/a&gt; 100 best photos gallery to decide a winner for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUcHeR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjmCcc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMTonE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htnkFr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAILoq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This affordable robot vacuum is even cheaper right now at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yeedi K650 robot vacuum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LImgF3OzO8n6pM-fi7Jb6HsfDlU=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121641/yeedik650skittles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t my house. Skittles operate well outside of the five-second drop rule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLAyaC"&gt;The latest (and even the not-so-new) robot vacuums from iRobot tend to cost, at least, a few hundred dollars. The sky is the limit, so to speak, when it comes to how much these can cost. But there’s a fantastic sale happening at Woot on this affordable model from a company called Yeedi. Its K650 Wi-Fi connected model with an 800-milliliter bin &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142096?sid=VergeDeals111021&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $130 right now&lt;/a&gt;. It’s currently sitting at $180 from Amazon, to give you a sense of how much it usually costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ye8Dz"&gt;This model claims to be great for pet owners, and through its companion app, you can schedule cleaning times, adjust the suction strength, and customize Yeedi’s optional magnetic boundaries, among other things. The Yeedi K650 is compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa smart assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dHMlRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10856865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QlaZd2"&gt;If you need more convincing before you buy,&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s resident smart home expert, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, said this of the K650:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cAURyh"&gt;“For a really basic just-go-do-it, budget bot, the Yeedi is a real bargain and has a huge bin, so you don’t have to empty it as often — you can also &lt;a href="https://www.yeedi.com/products/self-empty-station-yeedi-vac-series"&gt;get a self-empty station to go with it&lt;/a&gt; for another $200. It doesn’t have lidar or virtual boundaries (although there is a more expensive one that does), so you need to &lt;a href="https://www.yeedi.com/collections/accessories/k650"&gt;use magnetic strips&lt;/a&gt; if you want to stop it from going somewhere, but it’s under $200 and it really sucks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="DHZggk"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-97" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkdyLY"&gt;And now for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2P86C-1x3o"&gt;something completely different&lt;/a&gt;, the previous generation of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro that doesn’t have the M1 processor is $200 off at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553831-REG%2Fapple_mxaw2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22772076%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-ipad-pro-sennheiser-oneplus-woot-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $1,300, this sale brings the storage-packed 512GB version down to $1,100. When it originally released, we thought its performance and display were top-notch (it’s still a fantastic device). Its display has True Tone tech that adjusts its color temperature based on your ambient lighting, and it features ProMotion for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, making your content run smoother than ever. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rW0j6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="nsX2XE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cOfUIC"&gt;Another stunning deal is on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Version/dp/B08KXB3R7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 8T, which Amazon has reduced to just $450&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price ever for this model. The sticker price for this phone typically sits at around $600, but as long as you check the coupon box on the product page before you check out, you can save a grand total of $150. The 8T released about a year ago, and it’s an incremental upgrade over the OnePlus 8. But getting 256GB of storage and a 120Hz display at this price point is an excellent value, especially when you throw its Snapdragon 865 processor into the mix. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rCkP7g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9741432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk6IGU"&gt;With the impending release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711110/battlefield-2042-next-cross-gen-digital-standard-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on November 19th, it's the perfect time to gear up with this 500GB SSD from Western Digital. This PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD has been discounted to $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099GC4CRK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a complimentary code for the upcoming entry in the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield &lt;/em&gt;franchise (a $60 value). This essentially makes the SSD just $30 and is a solid value for 500GB of fast storage. If you want to double the storage, the 1TB version of the drive is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN750-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B099FNMV34?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $140&lt;/a&gt;. While this SSD is a perfectly suitable option for anyone looking to expand the storage of their desktop or gaming laptop, you’ll need to invest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;your own heatsink&lt;/a&gt; to attach to it before you install it in your PlayStation 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Noo40"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10753135"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktnQBs"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 wireless headphones are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; on the market today. These headphones normally cost $400, but the black-colored set is down to $248, while the white model is just $241 on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3MJBW8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which color you like, this is a solid deal and pretty close to the lowest price we’ve seen for these headphones at any retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoTqn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer&lt;/a&gt; was pleased with the addition of USB-C charging, as well as the incredibly comfortable design. While we admit that the original price was a bit high for what they offer, the Sennheiser Momentum headphones are a much better value at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3fehyd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPSayk"&gt;The delicious-looking Google Nest Mini is currently half price at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1505874-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00781_us_home_mini_charcoal_2nd.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22772076%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-ipad-pro-sennheiser-oneplus-woot-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJA2aQnTKB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/jWQnG5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00781us.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals111021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dorama,&lt;/a&gt; bringing the cost down to $25. This isn’t the lowest-ever price we’ve seen on this home assistant speaker, but nevertheless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; called it “a great sounding upgrade over the Home Mini.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KePwx7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tO18cA"&gt;A couple of other deals to check out...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gkTdGt"&gt;Save $100 on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ6MTC4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy RoboVac 12 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $140. Not quite the lowest price we’ve seen for this device, but it’s still a solid deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Yl4f8"&gt;Amazon is currently offering &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;four months of Kindle Unlimited for just $5&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $40 for a four-month subscription, this service grants you access to over 1 million books, thousands of audiobooks, and monthly issues of your favorite magazines. All of these features are accessible on any Kindle device or via the Kindle app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
