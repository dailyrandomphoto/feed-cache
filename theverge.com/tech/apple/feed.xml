    <title>Here’s why you can’t use the Siri Remote’s best feature on Disney Plus and other apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rae05jsZeZ7Xy96tJWJe7bcRUQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408279/DSCF3939.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The redesigned Siri Remote for Apple TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEFtbk"&gt;Apple’s new Siri Remote introduced a gesture that makes it easy to scrub through content by turning the control pad into a scroll wheel. But a number of Apple TV users noticed that the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518296/apple-new-siri-remote-hbo-max-disney-plus"&gt;doesn’t work properly&lt;/a&gt; on some services, like HBO Max, or at all on others, like Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQyWtu"&gt;A spokesperson for Disney Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature — one of the best on the redesigned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; — isn’t supported on its service. It’s not a service issue, though, but instead related to custom video players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2k9Pz"&gt;Some streaming apps available on Apple TV use their own players, while others use the tvOS media player. The jogging gesture works with streaming apps that use Apple’s native media player, but it is not yet supported for third-party developers that use a custom media player, and that includes Disney’s streaming titan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ezjArd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The feature is supported on apps that use the tvOS media player, which Disney Plus does not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KEE18v"&gt;What that means is that beyond just Disney Plus, the scrubbing tool may not work for any video app that uses its own media player. It’s not clear when exactly Apple will make the feature available to these app developers. But the Disney spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Disney Plus does plan to develop the tool for its own service once it does eventually become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wcucg6"&gt;The issue had been the topic of discussion in a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; from user batsforbreakfast21, who noted experiencing issues on Disney Plus but not other services like Netflix and Apple TV Plus. Other users expressed having issues with HBO Max and Peacock as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0ymlh"&gt;Neither Peacock nor HBO Max immediately returned requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI4rcS"&gt;Ideally, the issue will be resolved quickly. Until then, the older and often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;unfairly maligned Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t seem so bad, right? Anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14 basics: how to quit an app on your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fgEerp6jUFsMW4StV7QQVqy-HvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406377/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBAgE4"&gt;Even iOS apps occasionally misbehave — they can crash, or freeze, or otherwise stop working. If you’re new to iOS, or just haven’t had this happen before, you may not know how to actually quit an app (as opposed to just swiping it off your screen). Here’s how to quit an app using iOS 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fFpjG3"&gt;Open the App Switcher by either swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then pausing in the middle, or (if you have a Home button) double pressing the Home button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vYnTbm"&gt;You’ll see an overlapping view of all your open apps. Swipe to the right or left until you find the app you want to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HZCbTg"&gt;Swipe up on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app you want to quit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpaPAZ_gFiuw50kCvgvDaYPH8j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554891/IMG_A27F4BD48743_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe it up to quit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h3_ou0hV4pgpbnjCrn9sFtkrgrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554901/IMG_9FA2A8039FFE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe it up to quit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n10e51"&gt;Unfortunately, there isn’t any way to close all of your apps at once, should you wish to do so — you’ll have to simply swipe them off one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtwsFo"&gt;If for any reason swiping the app off doesn’t solve the problem, then &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/restart-iphone-iph841379c3d/14.0/ios/14.0"&gt;shut down your phone&lt;/a&gt; by pressing and holding the side button and either volume button until you see sliders appear. Drag the one that says “slide to power off” to the right. (If you have an iPhone with a Home button, instead, press and hold the side or the Sleep / Wake button.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLm1Bc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xW0scO"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0UHIl"&gt;This week, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; dedicates the show to operating systems — updates, releases, and rumors from this past week. Nilay and Dieter talk with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior editor Tom Warren and managing editor Alex Cranz about what to expect at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;Apple’s developer conference next week&lt;/a&gt; (HomeOS?), where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;Microsoft will take their OS next&lt;/a&gt; (Windows 11?), and the debut of some new systems like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463666/huawei-matepad-pro-harmonyos-tablet-features-specs"&gt;Huawei’s HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452620/google-fuchsia-os-nest-hub-smart-display-update-operating-system-linux-kernal"&gt;Google’s Fuchsia OS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021: iOS 15, new MacBook Pros, and what else to expect</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qq4VZ46b6ppEuSTkzmyvRj8pXY=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405394/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image for WWDC 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrPAza"&gt;Apple’s annual developer extravaganza, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), is coming up fast, kicking off with the keynote presentation on June 7th at 1PM ET. Like last year, WWDC will be an entirely digital and online-only event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the keynote, that means we can likely expect another tightly produced video highlighting everything Apple has in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcZ4wB"&gt;While we aren’t expecting any announcements on the level of Apple’s shift to custom silicon in its computers, which was WWDC 2020’s big news, Apple presumably has some notable changes in the works for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and its other operating systems. And if the current rumors pan out, we could also see brand-new MacBook Pros with the return of some long-missed features, such as MagSafe charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHOWsh"&gt;Read on to learn everything we expect from the big show. And don’t be surprised if Apple has a few surprises in store, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The large FaceID notch is still there, but it eventually feels normal." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9nbJbUEu2WEZNOlTas0gOz9CFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973495/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1kYgB"&gt;iOS 15 may bring improvements to notifications and iMessage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XOV5HQ"&gt;We haven’t heard much about what may be coming to Apple’s next version of its mobile operating system, which will presumably be called iOS 15, but we could see big changes to notifications and possibly iMessage, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGgV0K"&gt;For notifications, you may be able to have different notification settings for situations like driving, working, sleeping, or even a custom category, and you’ll be able to flip those on as you need to. You might also be able to set automatic replies based on which notification setting you’re currently using, like what you can do now with Do Not Disturb while driving mode. Personally, I’m hoping iOS 15 will let me allow notifications from a select few people while silencing just about everything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejmorG"&gt;As for iMessages, Apple is apparently working on features to make it act like “more of a social network” to compete with Facebook’s WhatsApp, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said, but those features are still “early in development” and could be announced at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHBN4P"&gt;Apple also plans to add a feature that shows you apps that are silently collecting data about you, continuing the company’s trend of adding privacy-focused updates to its operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qs0a7Q"&gt;For iPadOS 15, you can apparently expect a major update to the homescreen, including the ability to put widgets anywhere you want. And with Apple just introducing the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1-powered iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;, here’s hoping we see some new upgrades to take advantage of the new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWYOGr"&gt;In May, Apple also announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22457534%2Fapple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a lot of new accessibility features&lt;/a&gt; coming to Apple’s operating systems, such as improvements in iOS to VoiceOver, support for bidirectional hearing aids, a built-in background sounds player, and new Memoji customizations like cochlear implants. Apple said these features would arrive “later this year,” which suggests they’ll be included in iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7c0nD"&gt;We don’t know much about macOS, watchOS 8, and tvOS 15 — but we could see a new “homeOS”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NohEvo"&gt;We haven’t heard all that much about upcoming software updates for the Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, so we’ll just have to wait and see what Apple is cooking up. One tidbit: macOS could be a “more minor” update, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. That wouldn’t be too much of a surprise, given that the macOS operating system got a big overhaul &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;with Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AblZZZ"&gt;However, we could see the introduction of a brand-new operating system called “homeOS,” which was recently mentioned in and later removed from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-homeos-mentioned-in-job-listing/"&gt;an Apple job listing&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s unclear exactly which devices this OS is for, perhaps it will work on Apple’s home-focused products like the Apple TV and HomePod Mini.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UDG2Pc"&gt;New, redesigned MacBook Pros and a new Apple CPU could be announced&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5KJ6oA"&gt;Apple doesn’t always introduce new hardware at WWDC, but this year, new MacBook Pros seem like a possibility. In a May 18th report, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; that new MacBook Pros might arrive “as soon as early this summer,” which could indicate an announcement at WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QmUJq"&gt;These new laptops would have new Apple-designed processors that would “greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. The M1 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;already pretty dang good&lt;/a&gt;, so it sounds like these new chips could be even more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGX9qI"&gt;Apple is apparently planning on releasing &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; chips for the new Pros. Both should have eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores, while leaving you with the option of either 16 or 32 graphics cores. (By comparison, the M1’s CPU has four high-performance and four energy-efficient cores, while its GPU is offered with either seven or eight cores.) You’ll probably also be able to spec the laptops with as much as 64GB of memory, up from a max of 16GB on M1-equipped computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5MBrI"&gt;The new laptops should be offered with either 14-inch or 16-inch screens and those screens could have “brighter, higher contrast” displays, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;according to a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from January&lt;/a&gt;. The laptops may also have a new design with flat edges as in the iPhone 12, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in January&lt;/a&gt;. I’m curious to see what that design might look like in practice — I worry that the hard edges could be uncomfortable if you have the laptop on your lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OiOCO"&gt;The best rumor is that the new design may also mark the return of some of the ports and features that were taken away with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;now-infamous 2016 MacBook Pro redesign&lt;/a&gt;, including a MagSafe charger, an HDMI port, and an SD card slot, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said in its May report. And, according to Kuo, the OLED Touch Bar currently found on Intel-based MacBook Pros will apparently be removed in favor of physical function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cueoYL"&gt;We could see at least one other new Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr0eKZ"&gt;While it seems like MacBook Pros are the only new hardware we’ll be seeing at WWDC this year, that hasn’t stopped some other Mac rumors from swirling lately, and there’s always the chance Apple could announce more at its big event. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple also has “a revamped MacBook Air, a new low-end MacBook Pro, and an all-new Mac Pro workstation” in the works as well as a “higher-end Mac Mini desktop and larger iMac,” all of which would be powered by Apple’s custom silicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpTzLE"&gt;The new Mac Mini may have the same chip as the new MacBook Pros. The new Mac Pro could be a beast, with processors that are “either twice or four times as powerful as the new high-end MacBook Pro chip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8DBcX"&gt;And the redesigned “higher-end” MacBook Air could arrive as early as the end of this year. Frankly, I hope that refreshed Air arrives even later. I just bought the M1-equipped Air and it’s one of the best computers I’ve ever used, but I have a bad feeling I’ll be first in line to buy a redesigned and more capable Air anyway. (Especially if it gets the MagSafe charger that’s rumored for the new Pros.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SdMhc8"&gt;Apple might have dropped a hint about its AR / VR headset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hWxuz9"&gt;Apple has long been rumored to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;a mixed reality headset in the works&lt;/a&gt;, and recently, we’ve learned a few more potential details about it. The headset might be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; expensive — approximately $3,000, according to one report — though it could be packed with 8K displays, more than a dozen cameras to track hand movements and capture footage, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;might weigh less than an iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbDfpo"&gt;While the headset could be a ways out, as it’s not expected to ship until 2022 at the earliest, a few suspicious details in Apple’s WWDC promotional images &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be hinting toward some kind of reveal of Apple’s upcoming headset or the software on which it runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEwuRw"&gt;Check out this image below (that I also used at the top of this post), which Apple released alongside the announcement of WWDC in March. Notice the way the app icons are reflected in the glasses — I could imagine some sort of mixed reality headset showing icons in front of your eyes in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVsPoR1G837_6LQp6aHbEOLrLa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22549429/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those icons sure are reflected in an interesting spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJi4b2"&gt;Apple continued that reflections motif with new images released in May — you can see things from the laptop screens reflected in all of the eyes of the Memojis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bPEFWi2kCP_J0PT-w7N3kd70zVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22549430/Apple_WWDC21_details_announcement_052421.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at those reflections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xq7x4h"&gt;Now, these reflections may just be Apple’s artists flexing their design chops. And if I had to guess, given how far out a rumored mixed reality headset is, I don’t think we’re going to see anything about it at WWDC this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1tXnv"&gt;But Apple has surprised us in the past, and maybe these images are an indication of one more thing Apple has in store for WWDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SP4Jl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySvSwa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new TV remote is great, but only when apps properly support it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGjeS3jkHTEzIJSHAoxONF76doc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404757/DSCF3948_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbNWB6"&gt;Users are complaining that the Disney Plus and HBO Max Apple TV apps aren’t properly supporting the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;. Disney Plus has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;yet to be updated&lt;/a&gt; to make use of the remote’s helpful scroll wheel scrubbing feature, which works on rival Netflix and Apple TV Plus apps. The HBO Max app has more issues, &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and lacks support for several of the remote’s features and voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNBA7o"&gt;When we tried the HBO Max app for ourselves, we found it doesn’t seem to support the new remote’s D-pad. Instead, we could only use the remote’s touchpad circle, which is technically an element of the remote you’re supposed to be able to disable. Scrubbing using the touchpad works, just very badly. The cause of these problems appears to be a recent app update, which replaced the standard tvOS playback UI with HBO’s own (and apparently far less capable) version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBClAz"&gt;It just goes to show that a platform holder can build a powerful combination of hardware and software in support of third-party apps and services, but it doesn’t mean anything unless those same apps and services actually bother to add support. We’ve reached out to both Disney Plus and HBO Max to see if they’re aware of the issues, and to find out when users can expect a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iPad Pro has wireless charging and a glass back: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2021 11-inch iPad Pro. This review has focused a lot on the 12.9, but other than the screen and size the 11-inch is the same." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xD1MZdg_0RBL6JtRDapYh_oyZsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404453/vpavic_210512_4592_0203.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sYmdkN"&gt;Apple is working on a new version of the iPad Pro with wireless charging, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/apple-working-on-ipad-pro-with-wireless-charging-new-ipad-mini"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. To accommodate the technology, Apple will reportedly switch to a glass back for the new models, instead of the aluminum found on the rear of every iPad released so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nmfVk"&gt;Apple is said to be testing a magnetic charging system for the new iPad Pro similar to the MagSafe connector introduced with the iPhone 12 range of phones last year. Apple may also include reverse wireless charging in the new iPad Pro, according to the report, which would allow the iPad to serve as a wireless charging point itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nqHYdc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Editor’s Choice: iPad mini 2019","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18564029/ipad-mini-5th-generation-2019-editors-choice"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I4b119"&gt;Apple only just released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;the new M1 iPad Pro with its Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt;, and the wireless charging model reportedly won’t be ready until next year. However, Bloomberg also says that Apple will release a redesigned iPad Mini in 2021 with narrower screen bezels. It’s not clear whether it’ll switch to Face ID like the iPad Pro or Touch ID on the power button like the iPad Air — Bloomberg’s report only says that “the removal of its home button has also been tested.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7jgAh"&gt;Alongside the new iPad Mini, Apple is also said to be planning to release a thinner version of the 10.2-inch iPad. Both products are likely to be released around the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is updating AirTags to make them less creepy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QOSWYvghxFn8weHchD7bXIkdAs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69401765/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQ4Ki1"&gt;Apple is distributing an AirTags software update that makes it harder for people to use them for surreptitious tracking, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-bolsters-airtag-privacy-measures-to-offer-android-detector-app-later-this-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. According to a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple is also working on an app for Android users which will let them detect potentially unwanted trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoHH1q"&gt;AirTags were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as Apple’s solution for helping people keep track of everyday objects. In its marketing, Apple shows people finding their lost keys or bags that have the trackers attached. However, there have been concerns the tiny devices are being used to secretly track people without their knowledge, and we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review/"&gt;numerous reports&lt;/a&gt; since the AirTags’ release indicating that some tweaks were needed to make the devices more privacy-conscious for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B1up2"&gt;Before the update, if AirTags were away from their owner, they would chime &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-airtag-privacy-loopholes"&gt;after three days&lt;/a&gt; if they detected that they were moving. If you had a fully up-to-date iPhone, you might get an “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;AirTag Found Moving With You&lt;/a&gt;” notification &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-thing-about-apples-airtags-is-also-the-scaries-1846786338"&gt;before then&lt;/a&gt; — but un-updated iPhone users and Android users were out of luck until that chime. Apple is now updating the AirTags to chime at some point between eight and 24 hours of separation, significantly reducing how long an AirTag can travel before telling on itself. (Apple didn’t respond to request for comment on the range of times it provided.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQlugy"&gt;Apple says the Android app will be coming “later this year” and will be able to detect both AirTags and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;other Find My network accessories&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Chipolo tracker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFtfZW"&gt;Eight to 24 hours is still a long time to be tracked without knowing, but it’s good to see that Apple is at least starting to address some of people’s concerns. The update is out today and should happen automatically when an AirTag comes into proximity with an iPhone similar to how AirPods silently receive updates, according to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xomul"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satechi’s iPad Pro hub will let you pretend it’s a real desktop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Satechi iPad Pro hub and stand" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w8ifMTdAI2--42QeQ2aq-Za7xxY=/0x0:1883x1255/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69386929/satechihubstand.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complete your minimalist desk setup with this gadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4iZLq6"&gt;The latest gadget from Satechi &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1554062&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=98197&amp;amp;urllink=satechi%2Enet%2Fproducts%2Faluminum%2Dstand%2Dhub%2Dfor%2Dipad%2Dpro%3Fvariant%3D39394193965144&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeNintendoSwitch060321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is both a stand and a USB-C hub&lt;/a&gt; made for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models that have a USB-C charging port, as well as the 2020 iPad Air. It’s $100, and with your tablet wedged into the stand, it should look more like a traditional monitor, so you can keep on pretending it’s an actual desktop replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSDLIb"&gt;Like any hub, it gives you a handful of extra ports for expanding the functionality of your iPad. This one includes an HDMI port capable of outputting 4K at up to 60Hz refresh rate, a USB-A data port, a USB-C PD port with up to 60W of charging power, a headphone jack, and separate slots for an SD and microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BwGoZP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Put macOS on the iPad, you cowards","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gZePXNEZWZtwAdr7scNALtBXRDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22560318/ipaddock.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U4KuKK"&gt;You technically don’t need an iPad to use this hub, as this foldable stand is compatible with other computers, tablets, and phones that have a USB-C port. Satechi does mention, however, that your device needs a USB-C PD port for “full compatibility” with the hub. It lists the last five years of MacBook Pros, the 2018 and 2020 MacBook Air, Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7 and Surface Go, as well as the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Google Pixelbook as viable companions to its hub. Extra compatibility is nice, but if you don’t have an iPad (and thus, no need for the stand component), you can probably find a different USB-C hub that’s no less capable for cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>For Apple TV Plus to succeed, it has to be everywhere — even Android TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKzcOk"&gt;This week, Apple brought its Apple TV app to many new Android TV devices — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462960/apple-tv-app-nvidia-shield-now-available"&gt;not just the Nvidia Shield&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple was smart to widen that support — the expiration date for free trials of Apple TV Plus is swiftly approaching, with many customers about to see their subscriptions end July 1st. That gives Apple a month to win over Android TV users by letting them watch flagship shows like the earnest and delightful &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen, a show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;whose second season&lt;/a&gt; will premiere near the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz9VYe"&gt;The rollout of the Apple TV app to Android TV OS devices started Monday at 8AM PT, a Google spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As a caveat, the Google spokesperson clarified that support does not extend to third-party operator set-top boxes, so, for example, devices like AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21160860/att-tv-now-available-android-tv-google-assistant-streaming"&gt;Android TV set-top box&lt;/a&gt; probably won’t get Apple TV anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1vnhvI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The rollout does not extend to third-party operator set-top boxes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUmHPI"&gt;That Apple’s finally made its streaming app available across Android TV devices isn’t much of a shocker. The app was previously made available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287905/apple-tv-app-now-available-chromecast-google-tv"&gt;non-Apple devices&lt;/a&gt; like the Chromecast with Google TV and the PlayStation 5, and it’s been on Roku and Fire TV devices since 2019. Some Sony TVs running Android TV and other Vizio models running SmartCast OS additionally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516418/apple-tv-sony-android-now-available-software-update"&gt;received support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-tv-arrives-on-vizio-smartcast-tvs-1845006293"&gt;for the app&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNTqHY"&gt;But it’s also not entirely shocking for a company banking heavily on its services offerings. Apple seems to have figured out somewhere along the way that it needed to play nice with other device makers if it wanted to grow Apple TV Plus subscriptions in any meaningful way. With some &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/apple-services-revenue-tops-16-9-billion-4175371/"&gt;660 million paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; across its services as of April, Apple TV Plus’ &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1136261/number-of-apple-tv-plus-subscribers-us/"&gt;estimated 40 million&lt;/a&gt; U.S. subscribers is a small but certainly not insignificant slice of that pie — but that figure could quickly change come July when those users will have to decide whether Apple’s shows are worth paying for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeoJ1w"&gt;Apple launched its service back in 2019 with an astonishingly meager lineup of originals. Sure, they were high-caliber productions with big-name talent and directors at the helm. And sure, some of them were even good! (M. Night Shyamalan’s bizarre psychological thriller &lt;em&gt;Servant&lt;/em&gt; is one such example.) But Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394404/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-july-2021-ted-lasso-second-season-timing"&gt;extended its lengthy free trials&lt;/a&gt; of the service that it offered to users who purchased its devices, and that trial period is very nearly about to end for some of the earliest users to hop on the freebie train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TqZDcA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is about to face a subscriber reckoning&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RrhWAa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; — which Tim Cook has &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/apple-services-revenue-tops-16-9-billion-4175371/"&gt;cited as being a critical success&lt;/a&gt; for the platform — will, again, release its second season toward the end of next month. But for some Apple users, their free trials to Apple TV Plus end July 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8ywqr"&gt;In other words, Apple’s dangling a content carrot in front of its most loyal users in hopes that they’ll stick around and hand over their money. But with so many other services available at present, it’s unclear whether that’ll be enough to make them stay. In fact, research MoffettNathanson &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-freeloader-problem-percent-free-1234890385/"&gt;estimated earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 30 percent of Apple TV Plus subscribers did not plan to resubscribe following their trial periods. While $5 per month isn’t too much for a premium service comparatively speaking, it does start to add up when people are counting all the subscriptions they fork out money for each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBijHS"&gt;Because Apple’s entire plan for the service is to be a hub for either its own in-house productions — or exclusively attained feature films like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21264009/tom-hanks-greyhound-apple-tv-plus-streaming-sony-pictures-pandemic"&gt;Tom Hanks’ &lt;em&gt;Greyhound&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — that means the company has some catching up to do to reach anything close to the library scale of most of its peers, particularly considering it’s about to start making people pay for the service. Making it available across Android TV devices hooked up in users’ homes is a good way to prepare for this change. Plus, especially accounting for the pandemic, who on earth wants to watch an entire feature film on a palm-sized iPhone when they can watch it on the biggest screen in their home instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjWM4U"&gt;It’s almost as if Apple realized that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-never-made-imessage-for-android-to-lock-in-ios-us-1846650480"&gt;doing things the Apple way&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t going to be a successful model for competing in the streaming wars. And while the service is late to the party in terms of accessibility across platforms — it has taken far too long for this app to arrive on more Android TV devices, in my opinion — it was a necessary move for Apple TV Plus’s success in the long run. As long-trialed subscribers discover they’ll suddenly need to pay for Apple’s content, the churn is going to burn.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple asks staff to return to office three days a week starting in early September </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lLQ2WHLpEs-9flnsbZB5C7U9Hn8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69380177/acastro_190322_1777_apple_streaming_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q0JJHI"&gt;Apple employees are being asked to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Tim Cook sent out an email Wednesday informing staff of the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PODrP"&gt;“For all that we’ve been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other,” he said. “Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sgrpkz"&gt;Cook said that most employees will be asked to come in to the office on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, with the option of working remotely on Wednesdays and Fridays. Teams that need to work in-person will return four to five days a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnaG3Q"&gt;Employees also have the chance to work remotely for up to two weeks a year, “to be closer to family and loved ones, find a change of scenery, manage unexpected travel, or a different reason all your own,” according to the letter. Managers need to approve remote work requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLkk8F"&gt;The change is not entirely unexpected for Apple staff. While employees have worked remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, the company famously discouraged working from home prior to 2020. In December, Tim Cook told employees they could be asked to come back to the office as early as June, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/apple-encourages-staff-to-get-vaccinated-offers-paid-time-off?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xbt1dK"&gt;Apple’s stance on remote work, while getting more relaxed, is still conservative compared to the other tech giants. In May, Google announced that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/google-relaxes-remote-work-plan-will-let-20percent-of-employees-telecommute.html"&gt;20 percent of its workforce would be able to work from home permanently&lt;/a&gt;. Mark Zuckerberg has said that remote work “is the future,” and told Facebook employees they can all work from home forever, so long as they get their manager’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYLBVR"&gt;In the letter Wednesday, Cook also encouraged all employees to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZawd9"&gt;“For now, let me simply say that I look forward to seeing your faces,” he said in closing. “I know I’m not alone in missing the hum of activity, the energy, creativity and collaboration of our in-person meetings and the sense of community we’ve all built.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1Ly2l"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
