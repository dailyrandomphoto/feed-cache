  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="exIuas"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22149716"&gt;Apple’s new iPad Pros have the company’s M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LQgYgx"&gt;Apple unveiled its newest iPad Pro tablets, and they’re equipped with the same Apple-designed M1 chip in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini (and the new iMac, also announced today). The 12.9-inch model has an upgraded display that uses 10,000 Mini LEDs, and Apple calls it the Liquid Retina XDR display. Both iPad Pros also have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that can automatically track you during video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3W8ao"&gt;You can order the tablets on April 30th, and they will be available in the second half of May. The 11-inch model starts at $799, and the 12.9-inch model starts at $1,099.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="g17dqO"&gt;Apple debuted a completely redesigned iMac that also has the M1 chip. It’s really thin, has a 24-inch screen, a 1080p FaceTime camera, and comes in seven different colors. They’ll also come with a new wireless keyboard that includes Touch ID for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PdqL3"&gt;You can buy the new iMac in four colors starting at $1,299 and in seven colors and better specs starting at $1,499. You can order it starting on April 30th, and it will be available in the second half of May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Y6n88W"&gt;At long last, Apple took the wraps off its long-rumored AirTag item trackers, which you can track in the Find My app. You can customize your AirTag with emoji, too. You’ll be able to preorder them on Friday for $29, and they’ll be available on April 30th. You can also get a four-pack for $99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches new iPad Pro with M1 processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RThDKKvsa37AWzXULQcYRLpf3Bw=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157640/lcimg_06ebca85_7eac_4c32_9e8f_4b98fad99ec8.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rquOpZ"&gt;Right on schedule, Apple has launched the next generation of its iPad Pro. As was the case with the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s improvements to the iPad Pro are largely on the inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELYssq"&gt;The device has a new eight-core M1 processor, the same chip that powers the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini. Apple claims this will deliver “a big jump in performance” over the previous generation. The graphics performance is over 1,500 times faster, per the company. The chip brings a number of new features, including a “next-generation 16-core Apple Neural engine” and an advanced image signal processor. Apple also says you can expect up to 10 hours of battery life from Wi-Fi models, and nine hours from Wi-Fi + Cellular models. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BdPe4hhuUM-Pj_1LqM5XMsHCmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457435/lcimg_5b9a9e8b_c6d0_48da_8f7c_ad8d1086a21e.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yzNQb8"&gt;The iPad Pro now supports Thunderbolt 3 and USB 4, as well as millimeter wave 5G connectivity. Apple says the tablet will offer “the broadest 5G coverage worldwide,” reaching speeds up to 4Gbps, and will support eSIM. The company didn’t mention its U1 locator chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnRj5d"&gt;There’s an improved camera as well. Apple says the ISP and LIDAR scanner will capture “incredible details” in low-light conditions. There’s a TrueDepth camera system on the front of the device, which allows users to unlock it with facial recognition. The system includes a new 12MP ultra-wide camera with a 120-degree field of view. The camera will automatically pan to follow you around during video calls with a new feature called Center Stage. Some smart displays, such as the Facebook Portal, offer similar features. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcy6M1ba7uE9QKhvYmwwnbhDRy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457520/lcimg_80056320_9cae_41a0_ae7b_242b83419310.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XACejP"&gt;The iPad Pro will support the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio, as well as the Magic Keyboard, which is available in a new white color. On the gaming front, it also supports PS5 and Xbox controllers with haptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miSm1Q"&gt;Apple says the device uses a 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosure. The magnets in the enclosure and the speakers include 100 percent “recycled rare earth elements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQW9Ys"&gt;The iPad comes in two sizes: an 11-inch option and a 12.9-inch option, with starting weights of 1.03 pounds and 1.5 pounds respectively. You can configure both with up to 16GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. They ship with a one-meter USB-C charging cable and a 20W USB-C power adapter. The 11-inch model has a 28.65 watt-hour battery, and the larger device has a 40.88 watt-hour battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQsAai"&gt;The 12.9-inch iPad models also include a new Mini-LED screen, the Liquid Retina XDR, which Apple says delivers “XDR-level brightness.” The 2732 x 2048 display includes 10,000 Mini LEDs and will reach up to 1,000 nits of brightness and a 1 million-to-one contrast ratio, Apple claims. This component has run Apple into some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;supply chain issues&lt;/a&gt; recently — one manufacturer has reportedly paused production. (The 11-incher comes with a regular Liquid Retina display with 2388 x 1688 resolution, which maxes out at 600 nits of brightness.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzPaq_lDc873Jt4LnGCdsIGCfEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457518/lcimg_34fb76c1_9a66_47dd_b873_8be9a156eda3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ksncYk"&gt;The 11-inch model starts at $799 (Wi-Fi) and $999 (Wi-Fi + Cellular), and the 12.9-inch one begins at $1,099 (Wi-Fi) and $1,299 (Wi-Fi + Cellular). Education pricing is also available: college students can get the 11-inch model for $749 and the 12.9-inch model for $999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9r32RI"&gt;Both models will be available in the second half of May, with preorders going live on April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lsYgY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces thinner iMac with M1 chip and bright colors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing all seven colors of the new iMac: green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and silver." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01Hwl_PP17A1y5ukMWlyzLOqhrk=/168x0:1977x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157337/apple_new_imac_spring21_hero_04202021_Full_Bleed_Image.jpg.medium_2x.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The redesigned iMac will be available in seven colors. | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sq8H0d"&gt;Apple introduced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fimac-24%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394034%2Fapple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt; today with a slimmer display, an Apple Silicon chip, and a case with bright, bold colors that throws back to the classic colorful all-in-one iMacs. Apple said the new iMac was designed from the ground up for the M1 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIOw47"&gt;The new iMac has a 24-inch, 4.5K display with narrower borders around the top and sides. It still has a large chin on the bottom, but the rear of the display is now flat instead of curved — Apple says the volume has been reduced by over 50 percent. The screen also has Apple’s True Tone tech for automatically adjusting the color temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2UaH0"&gt;Apple is also promising a &lt;em&gt;much-needed&lt;/em&gt; update to the iMac’s camera and mics so that you’ll look better on video calls. It now has a 1080p resolution and a larger sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vBqQtn2TnunAHOFBpmejKafs6jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457424/138_2021_04_20_138_vlcscreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3TpU4"&gt;The new iMac is 11.5mm thin, but Apple says it should stay quieter and cooler than the previous model thanks to the M1 chip. The new model has “two small fans” replacing the “bulky thermal system” of the previous-generation iMac, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLfmyU"&gt;There’s also a new magnetic power cable — it sounds a lot like the old MagSafe cable — that attaches to the back. Ethernet can be connected to the power brick and delivered through the same cable. The entry-level model will come with two USB-C / Thunderbolt ports on the back, and a higher-end model will add an additional two USB-C ports (without Thunderbolt support). Incredibly, there is still a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAJ5wTLC_RgDjCr2RsFxDoM6SVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457430/133_2021_04_20_133_vlcscreen.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Omd2LX"&gt;Alongside the new iMac, Apple is also introducing a keyboard, mouse, and trackpad in colors to match. The keyboard has a Touch ID button for logging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzLG3b"&gt;The new iMac starts at $1,299, though some of the colors are reserved for the higher-end $1,499 model. It’ll be available in the second half of May, with orders &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fimac-features-all-new-design-in-vibrant-colors-m1-chip-and-45k-retina-display%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394034%2Fapple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting April 30th&lt;/a&gt;. There are seven color options total. The base model comes with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD; it can be upgraded to include up to 16GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfXZ5X"&gt;This is the first iMac to switch to Apple Silicon, the chips that Apple has been designing in-house. The company first added an Apple Silicon chip to the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini in November. Apple plans to eventually roll out these Arm-based chips to its entire Mac line. While the transition means that macOS software needs to be updated to support the new chips, so far the trade-offs have been worth it. The first generation of M1 Macs have been extremely well received, with the new chips offering improved power and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ted Lasso season 2 is coming in July, and it looks as charming as ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_NZXh_xi2CKlWgGGdF1Njz-z7KA=/54x0:1226x781/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157256/ted_lasso.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PoY09O"&gt;Apple’s event today was full of hardware and new products, but the company also took some time to have fun by unveiling a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season. The show — which stars Jason Sudeikis as a perpetually positive football coach who takes on a gig helming an English soccer team — has been one of the breakout hits on Apple TV Plus, the company’s fledgling streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="beiCR8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I always hear the question: who let the dogs out (who who who who)? With respect to The Baha Men, I prefer WHEN let the dogs out (when when when when)? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Cause guess what, Greyhounds? Our 2nd season starts 7/23! Can I get a Bah Amen!? That’s what I used to think they were called&lt;/p&gt;— Ted Lasso (@TedLasso) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TedLasso/status/1384556102856024073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k4wX62"&gt;Season 2 follows Lasso as he leads AFC Richmond during a season of turmoil, with the club recently relegated to a lower league. That said, it looks just as charming as season 1, with plenty of folksy expressions and largely the same cast of beloved characters. Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; will debut on July 23rd. No word on whether &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2021/4/19/22391172/european-super-league-announcement-tearing-soccer-apart"&gt;the controversial European Super League&lt;/a&gt; will be a plot point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USBeLY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22148310"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apple “Spring Loaded” live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple unveils a redesigned remote for its new Apple TV 4K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ZlNorpb2ByNkPP15vvxDBKbkJE=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157146/WcGeQVXeT3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g60avE"&gt;The Apple TV remote is one of the weakest parts of the company’s set-top box, and Apple is, at last, addressing it today. The company just unveiled a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-unveils-the-next-generation-of-apple-tv-4k%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F18277449%2Fapple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;redesigned Siri remote&lt;/a&gt; alongside its new Apple TV 4K. You’ll get the new remote with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"&gt;new $179 4K set-top box&lt;/a&gt;, or it’s available separately for $59. As well as being compatible with the new Apple TV 4K, it also works with the 2017 model and Apple TV HD. Apple will also sell the remote bundled with the Apple TV HD for $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4OhwO"&gt;The new Siri remote has an iPod-style scroll wheel, a five-way click pad, touch controls, a mute button, and a power button that can turn your TV on and off. Meanwhile, the Siri button is now on the side of the remote, and Apple says that the voice assistant now works on Apple TV in Austria, Ireland, and New Zealand, in addition to the 13 countries where it was already supported. Finally, the new Siri remote’s enclosure is made out of 100 percent recycled aluminum. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D0bMiw6aqFs4DQELBC2-fnrjS-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457422/Apple_unveils_the_next_gen_of_AppleTV4K_042021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new remote alongside the new Apple TV 4K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QYtvOK"&gt;The new remote was unveiled alongside Apple’s updated Apple TV 4K box, which has a more powerful processor that can support high-frame rate HDR content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubLEaC"&gt;Although the build quality and looks of the existing set-top box’s remote have never been lacking, people have had no shortage of complaints about its functionality. For one, its size can be too small to be used comfortably, and it’s also super easy to lose. Design-wise, it’s annoyingly symmetrical, so half the time, you’re likely to pick it up the wrong way if you’re not careful. Many of these issues look like they’ve been addressed with the new remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yypdBY"&gt;Yes, you’ve always been able to replace the Apple TV’s remote with a universal remote or use an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/1/12344908/apple-tv-remote-app-iphone-released"&gt;app on your phone&lt;/a&gt; to control the set-top box. But for those who just want a better first-party remote, here is that solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8fzGh"&gt;The new remote will be available alongside the new Apple TV 4K, which can be preordered starting April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new Apple TV 4K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NPFSzjL4R20vNldYJVfuFbVIjUU=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157139/Apple_unveils_the_next_gen_of_AppleTV4K_042021.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Apple TV 4K with redesigned remote&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IQ2lHr"&gt;Apple has just announced a new Apple TV streaming box, replacing the Apple TV 4K that came out in 2017. The new model retains the name of the prior model but comes with a more powerful A12 Bionic chip that lets it play HDR video at higher frame rates. It’s also powerful enough to support 60fps Dolby Vision playback over AirPlay from a compatible iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mNwFG"&gt;The old Apple TV 4K, which has been Apple’s flagship set-top box for four years, supports 4K streaming as well as HDR, including Dolby Vision. It also supports Dolby Atmos sound codecs. But it doesn’t support 120Hz refresh rates, which might be important should you ever want to play serious games on an Apple TV. It also has the most notoriously bad remote control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CreNyM"&gt;Fortunately, Apple has completely redesigned the remote for the new Apple TV 4K with an improved, more ergonomic design and more capabilities. The new remote is thicker than the prior model, has a new five-way touch controller in place of the maligned swipe pad of the original, and a proper power button to turn off your TV. The Siri search button has been moved to the side of the remote, under your right thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3i6vpuVKuIckJS1BlJrUFry77Ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457338/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_1.17.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ObEznr"&gt;Apple did not redesign the Apple TV box itself — it remains a squircle-shaped puck that you have to put on a shelf or entertainment center, unlike the dongle designs that many of Apple’s competitors use now. A new feature allows the Apple TV to optimize the colors of your TV screen using the light sensor on an iPhone. Apple says it is working with a number of content providers to produce high frame rate HDR content for the new Apple TV, including Fox Sports, NBCUniversal, Paramount Plus, Red Bull TV, and Canal Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLsQ0H"&gt;The new Apple TV 4K starts at $179 for 32GB of storage and will be available to purchase starting on April 30th. A 64GB model will also be available for $199. Apple is also selling the older Apple TV HD, which is limited to 1080p resolution, with the new remote for $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11gKdi"&gt;All of those prices are a lot higher than Apple’s competitors, such as Amazon, Google, and Roku. Apple is betting once again that people will pay for performance and ecosystem in a set-top box and is charging a hefty premium for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hQrN7O4IFVm1aj9wteZlwIoAM5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457346/image__1_.png"&gt;

    <title>Apple announces $29 AirTag, a new Tile-like item tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dVKWehDNWYWp3kjdEXvEtfrGWhM=/0x0:2142x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157033/airtag.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j8KDpM"&gt;Apple is officially launching a Tile-like item tracker that will work with the company’s software and services. Dubbed AirTag, the small circular tag will allow you to track items within Apple’s “Find My” app on iOS. Much like Tile, Apple’s AirTags will be useful for tracking items like keys or wallets, and you’ll be provided with notifications when you’re separated from your item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFHPxJ"&gt;The AirTag itself is a small puck-like device that includes a built-in speaker, accelerometer, Bluetooth LE, and a user-replaceable battery. Apple says the tracker should last for a year of battery life, and you can use an NFC tap to activate a lost mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBClv4"&gt;AirTag will be available for $29 on April 30th, or $99 for a four-pack of the devices. Preorders begin this Friday at 5AM PT / 8AM ET. Apple has also created leather loop and key ring accessories that the AirTag can slot into, and the company is also working with accessory makers to create luggage tag enclosures for the AirTag itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Co3luD8e5pkvGFCzcC1RfxhbWE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457308/yJBAy1w.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTag accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nuC1qU"&gt;AirTags will show up in Apple’s Find My app, and the app will play a sound on the tracker when you attempt to locate an item. Each AirTag is also equipped with Apple’s U1 chip that uses Ultra Wideband technology, sound, and haptic feedback to guide people more precisely to where an item is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otjDBc"&gt;AirTags don’t store any location data or location history inside the physical device, and Apple says it’s using end-to-end encryption for the communications between an AirTag and the Find My network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZrAJy"&gt;Details about AirTags first appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841204/ios13-code-apple-tile-location-tracking-tag-find-my-app"&gt;copies of the iOS 13 beta&lt;/a&gt; nearly two years ago, and the AirTags name was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936650/apple-airtag-tile-device-reference-ios-13-2-rumors"&gt;spotted in iOS 13.2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;confirmed the AirTags name&lt;/a&gt; in a deleted support video last year, too. Following the rumors, it has taken Apple a considerable amount of time to make AirTags a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rdhx1a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;First rumored in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XUpJWs"&gt;Apple will clearly be competing with Tile with its AirTags, but the location-tracking company has been attempting to embed its technology directly into Bluetooth chips in recent years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/7/18168760/tile-bluetooth-low-energy-item-tracking-ces-2019"&gt;Tile has previously teamed up with&lt;/a&gt; Qualcomm, Dialog Semiconductor, Silicon Labs, and Toshiba to include Tile compatibility as an option on devices. Tile has also embedded its location-tracking network into gadgets from Boosted and Bose and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;prepping its own AirTags competitor&lt;/a&gt; that could let you find lost items through walls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/42-pjBPrigLZ-EV_VW5rwDUSutY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457331/airtagaccessories.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirTag accessories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3aySXB"&gt;Apple will certainly face some competition from Tile’s broader reach here, but the deeper integration with iOS and iPhones will be a significant challenge for Tile and other competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung’s $29.99 Galaxy SmartTags&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s launch of AirTags comes nearly a year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274709/apple-tile-european-commission-eu-complaint-app-store-iphone-response"&gt;Tile filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the European Commission, accusing Apple of anti-competitive behavior. Tile argues that Apple’s iOS 13.5 update to Bluetooth settings has disadvantaged third-party tracking products in favor of Apple’s own Find My app that doesn’t include the same restrictions by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5u240W"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274709/apple-tile-european-commission-eu-complaint-app-store-iphone-response"&gt;strenuously denied the allegations&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;opened up its Find My app&lt;/a&gt; to third-party products recently. Devices will need to play by Apple’s Made for iPhone (MFi) accessory rules, so companies will need to apply to get certified and have their products tracked in the Find My app. Apple is also offering a chipset specification for third parties to integrate with the Ultra-Wideband found in Apple’s latest iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Podcasts launches in-app subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUkdS-EhgNsYCMxUhIGKAH5uGcw=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157017/download.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U3LDqi"&gt;A monumental change is coming to Apple Podcasts’ business: the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22381980%2Fapple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is launching subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; within the Apple Podcasts app. During its spring event today, the company announced that people will be able to subscribe to content from the app for extra perks, like ad-free and bonus content, as well as early access. It’ll launch in 170 regions and countries next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfFnbY"&gt;Initial partners include Pushkin Industries, QCODE, and NPR. It appears that content creators will have to pay Apple $19.99 per year in order to offer subscriptions, and Apple &lt;a href="https://cldup.com/7A0ryPSQNi.pdf"&gt;will take&lt;/a&gt; 30 percent of revenue for the first year and 15 percent for the years following. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yXRzM"&gt;The app is also getting a redesign with channels to help people find new content curated by their favorite creators. These channels will feature artwork, titles, and descriptions unique to Apple Podcasts, and some might promote free content while others are paid. Luminary, a subscription-based podcast app that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18510897/luminary-podcast-app-launch-the-daily-gimlet-media-spotify"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, is an initial channel partner. The company said today that people will be able to subscribe to Luminary shows from Apple Podcasts, as well as in the Luminary app. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/the-athletic-launches-podcast-network-65f115a8-da39-409b-98df-80d74a325966.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Athletic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appears to be offering a similar setup, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAapUm"&gt;Other new features include a “Smart Play” button that’ll allow listeners to automatically start episodic shows from the newest episode and serialized shows from the beginning of the series. Listeners can also save individual episodes, which are downloaded for offline playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1ulR7"&gt;Overall, Apple is seemingly taking a bigger interest in the creators who use its platform to reach listeners. People widely speculated that Apple would launch a subscription service to promote its own original content, which has focused on companion shows for its TV Plus and Books content. Now, it appears that Apple instead sees an opportunity to make money off the podcasters themselves without investing in its own exclusive programming. This could set Apple up to more directly compete with platforms like Patreon, which have courted podcasters. Patreon &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/product/pricing"&gt;only takes up to&lt;/a&gt; 12 percent of subscription revenue, however, so it seems unlikely successful podcasters will switch their models over to Apple Podcasts exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An1u4J"&gt;Apple has, for years, been the de facto app on which people listen to podcasts, partially because of its pre-installation on iPhones. That is, up until Spotify entered the fold in earnest in 2019. Since then, the company has been gunning for Apple’s market share, bolstered by flashy exclusive deals, acquisitions, and the company’s own podcast creation software funnel. The strategy appears to be working. eMarketer reported last month that this year, 28.2 million people will listen to podcasts in the US on Spotify versus Apple Podcasts’ 28 million. A separate report from Voxnest &lt;a href="https://blog.voxnest.com/apple-spotify-podcast-listeners-q1/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; also found Spotify gaining ground in the US, specifically in New Jersey and California where it says the player has overtaken Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7pJv3"&gt;Spotify has voiced an interest in helping creators monetize, as well, so it could end up competing with Apple for creators’ exclusive content, or podcasters will end up having to manage their subscriptions across various apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9pBV8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s ‘Spring Loaded’ iPad Pro event live blog</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAeLIPlj1WB0iNe2iu2C-XBLpJA=/0x197:2040x1557/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69156579/springblack3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;iPads? AirTags? AirPods? There could be a lot on tap today&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="t9GFfK"&gt;Apple seemingly has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;big backlog of products to announce&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been anticipating new iPad Pros, AirTags, AirPods, an Apple TV, and just maybe a new iMac with Arm-based Apple Silicon. The tagline for today’s event, “Spring Loaded,” seems to be a hint that today’s live stream will be chock-full of new stuff. All signs, however, point to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;new iPad Pros being the star of the show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuMEtV"&gt;And it might not be just hardware. Apple is increasingly pushing its own services. Perhaps there will be more on tap today to fill out its Apple One bundle. Obvious candidates are some kind of premium podcast option or maybe even an HD option for Apple Music, but the Apple TV Plus service could also stand to get some more premiere content and today’s stream might be a good place to announce it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxVehb"&gt;There are a lot of possibilities, but only Apple knows which of them it’s choosing for this “loaded” live stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJVVpE"&gt;We hope to find out ourselves soon. The event kicks off at 10AM PT / 1PM ET, and we’ll be live-blogging all of the announcements from the live stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJt1Gk"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/13709/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s ‘Spring Loaded’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Spring Loaded 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0k56xFYkqYklvP154YETbB7r5PI=/0x0:1770x1180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154983/appleinvite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d7b3MP"&gt;Whenever Apple decides to schedule an event, you know there are going to be some interesting products introduced, with at least one major device taking center stage and perhaps one or two surprise entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmxQwt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;Current rumors&lt;/a&gt; have Apple introducing 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, the latter with Apple’s first Mini LED display. There may also be a new Apple Pencil stylus to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gb8Fz"&gt;What else? We could see Apple’s long-awaited AirTags, device trackers that are set to go up against Tile, the current leader in that particular market. There is the possibility of a new iPod Mini, a third-generation version of the AirPods, a new model of the Apple TV (which was released in 2017), and the official release of iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ksWii"&gt;Anything more? Well, that’s always a possibility. Be here at 1PM ET and find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIVuhB"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE APPLE “SPRING LOADED” EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You’ll have to tune into the live stream, which starts at 10AM PT / 1PM ET today, Tuesday, April 20th. The event will likely be available to watch again after it concludes, so you’re not stuck if you miss out on the debut stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH THE APPLE EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XbxczI"&gt;As always, Apple is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22385720%2Fapple-event-watch-live-stream-date-start-time-spring-loaded" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting the stream on its site&lt;/a&gt;.
