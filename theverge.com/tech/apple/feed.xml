    <title>Apple’s big event today stressed its major focus on streaming </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KdRyAk"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;big product event&lt;/a&gt; today was all about iPhones, iPads, and the latest generation of its smartwatch — but make no mistake, it also underscored Apple’s increasingly aggressive push to dominate streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYOaep"&gt;Apple wasted no time on Tuesday showcasing its quickly expanding and award-winning roster of originals on Apple TV Plus, with Apple boss Tim Cook kicking off the “California Streaming” event with a highlight reel of fall premieres and soon-to-debut titles. Cook gave a nod to the more than 130 wins and 500-plus award nominations for the service’s original films and series since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21262291/apple-tv-plus-morning-show-licensed-movies-netflix-disney-plus-quibi"&gt;launching in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, taking time to specifically herald the success of critical darling &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which recently swooped up a record-breaking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F07%2Fapple-scores-35-emmy-nominations-including-20-for-hit-series-ted-lasso%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22673907%2Fapple-event-2021-apple-tv-plus-streaming-wars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20 Emmy nominations&lt;/a&gt;. (Apple TV Plus had 35 total nominations for all of its titles, which is fairly impressive for a service that’s less than two years old.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hnWIsl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple kicked off its hardware event with an intro dedicated to Apple TV Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GbQrHh"&gt;For a hardware event that didn’t have too much to share beyond what’s coming to Apple TV Plus in the near future, much of which has already been made public, Apple’s decision to spend a significant chunk of time highlighting its forthcoming roster of content proved once again that it’s serious about growing its streaming service. And Apple is reportedly prepared to swing even bigger as it continues to expand its franchises and originals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqXN7W"&gt;Citing a source familiar with the matter, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-a-streaming-punchline-no-more"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported last week that the company “intends to significantly up its output of new TV shows and movies to at least one a week.” To promote its titles, Apple could spend more than $500 million on marketing the service, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported, citing a separate source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e1r2K1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UL-rZg5yErE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhnDFg"&gt;Apple’s not just expanding its library, either. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22559665/tvos-15-beta-apple-tv-how-to-install"&gt;launching new ways&lt;/a&gt; for its users to stream content from devices within its ecosystem, with SharePlay among the most exciting of these features coming to Apple devices with iOS 15 — though it won’t debut with the initial rollout but instead in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;a future update&lt;/a&gt;. Even still, SharePlay, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;watch party tool&lt;/a&gt; that allows Apple users to stream content from Apple as well as from other services together in real time, was teased throughout Tuesday’s product event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsfeOH"&gt;And it looks like Apple’s been busy expanding this feature ahead of its official launch, too. When it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in June, under a dozen apps were said to have support for the tool, including Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, TikTok, and Twitch. That list had been expanded as of Tuesday’s launch, with Comedy Central, Showtime, Spotify, Starz, and more appearing in a slide about SharePlay partners for video and music streaming. Presumably, this list will continue to grow ahead of the feature’s official debut. Apple told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in June that SharePlay is available to any streaming partner who wants to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8y61Kr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s launching features that make streaming more accessible than ever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xm9Sun"&gt;Despite all of its award accolades, Apple still has several hurdles it’ll have to navigate if it hopes to take on streaming kings like Netflix and Disney. Its library needs to get bigger, and fast, if it hopes to hang on to subscribers once their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544099/apple-tv-plus-one-year-free-ending-three-months"&gt;free trials&lt;/a&gt; have run out. It will also have to figure out a way to drum up more fanfare for its series to get viewers excited about them &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they debut on the service (both things that it sounds like Apple is already working on). In many ways, the kind of hype we saw during today’s event is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to propel the service forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Awtn1i"&gt;But if Cook’s enthusiastic praise of Apple’s to-date originals is any indication, Apple is only just getting started. And the company’s deep pockets and software integrations geared at making streaming accessible more than prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKF7xFC4hTYRm-7tz1b73WWCeWk=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857848/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the colors of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIBU9V"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;a fleet of new products at its “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;. Chief among them — you guessed it — was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. This one is coming in various sizes and colors, but with smaller notches, the new A15 Bionic chipset, and with redesigned and improved cameras located around the back. Going from smallest to largest, Apple will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and finally the iPhone 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;With the Pro and Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be able to get the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage, along with 120Hz refresh rate displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1YGEt"&gt;If you’re looking forward to ordering any of the four iPhone 13 models, the good news is you won’t have to wait long to both preorder and receive your new phone. The preorder phase begins on Friday, September 17th, and they’ll release the following week on Friday, September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIozlV"&gt;I’m going to tell you where you can preorder one of these new phones and how much it’ll cost, whether you’re purchasing one unlocked or through your carrier as an upgrade. We’ll be adding more carrier deals as the week goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7zyyJ"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7E96Ug"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is the 2021 iteration on the Mini phone form factor with a 5.4-inch OLED screen. Apple says that this newer version should get better battery life than the previous model. Battery life was one of the few disappointments in the iPhone 12 Mini, so it’s good that Apple seems to have made improvements here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytXyfk"&gt;Apple will offer the iPhone 13 Mini starting with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $729&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to opt for more storage with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; versions for $829 or $1,029, respectively. If you purchase through a carrier via Apple’s site, the starting price of each configuration drops $30, starting at $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nPdN53"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DVnDHN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 has a 6.1-inch OLED display, the same size as last year’s model. Like other models this year, Apple upgraded the internal chipset to the A15 Bionic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NHlw2"&gt;Preorders will begin Friday, September 17th at Apple. Buying them unlocked will cost you $30 more than buying through a carrier, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $829 for the 128GB version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$929 for the 256GB version&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,129 for the 512GB version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BaJlBq"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eBv8ru"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are the biggest and most capable models coming out of Apple in 2021. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch OLED display with an A15 Bionic chipset, while the Pro Max has a bigger 6.7-inch OLED. Both support up to 120Hz refresh rate, which is an improvement that’s long been anticipated. However, you’ll also pay a lot more for this model than the base iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAUxcl"&gt;At Apple, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models start at $999 and $1,099, respectively. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; will run you $1,099, while the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; will cost $1,199. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration&lt;/a&gt; of either model will also cost an extra $200, with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,499 and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,599. Unlike the iPhone 13 Mini and standard iPhone 13, there’s no $30 price difference if you choose to purchase the Pro line unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder Apple’s new iPad and iPad Mini</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJh377rgCk0xrZL9VTIMCiq3dLo=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857722/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ztdXBm"&gt;As expected, Apple’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;California Streaming&lt;/a&gt;” was loaded with a flurry of announcements, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also used its annual fall showcase to introduce its latest tablets, specifically the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;ninth-gen iPad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;all-new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is a follow-up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;2019 iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; that takes heavy design cues from last year’s iPad Air. The new models are set to launch on Friday, September 24th, starting at $329 and $499, respectively, with preorders beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yMH3Z4"&gt;Where to buy the all-new iPad Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U3t2M7"&gt;Spec-wise, the new iPad Mini is a far cry from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3576178/apple-ipad-mini-review"&gt;original iPad Mini model&lt;/a&gt; and one of the bigger revamps to come to Apple’s smallest tablet since it made its debut in 2012. The sixth-gen model features slimmer bezels, an A15 Bionic chip, and a larger, 8.3-inch display. Like the iPad Air, the forthcoming tablet also ditches the aging home button, adds USB-C support, and incorporates a Touch ID sensor within the top-mounted power button. It also supports 5G and Wi-Fi 6, works with the second-gen Apple Pencil, and features a 12MP ultrawide camera on the front, allowing for the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt; Apple introduced with the iPad Pro last year. Additionally, like the ninth-gen iPad, it ships with iPadOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fECKGb"&gt;The latest iPad Mini comes in two different storage configurations, 64GB and 256GB, and in four colorways (purple, pink, starlight, and space gray). The 64GB configuration retails for $499 and the 256GB model for $649; both models are &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/WDN6YX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; beginning today at Apple, with shipments expected to arrive before the tablet’s launch on Friday, September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0DybVI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jyQB1V"&gt;Like the Wi-Fi model, the iPad Mini with cellular connectivity is available in two sizes: 64GB and 256GB. Both come in an array of colors — purple, pink, starlight, and space gray — with prices starting at $649 and $799, respectively. Both configurations are also &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/WDN6YX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; starting today at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lsq6xQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743742"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CBe2E6"&gt;Where to buy the new entry-level iPad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iZJ1f5"&gt;The entry-level iPad remains the most popular tablet in Apple’s lineup. The ninth-generation model keeps the same name the tablet has had since its introduction in 2010, but showcases several updates, including a new processor called the A13 Bionic, which is supposedly 20 percent faster than the outgoing model. Thanks to a 12MP camera on the front, the forthcoming device also supports Apple’s aforementioned Center Stage feature, however, the rest of the updates are more trivial. The new iPad still comes equipped with the same 10.2-inch display as before — this time with Apple’s True Tone technology — as well as a Lightning port, home button, and a single rear camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blvpwY"&gt;The new iPad comes in two different storage configurations, 64GB and 256GB, and in two colorways, silver and space gray. The 64GB configuration starts at $329 and the 256GB model for $479; both models are &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/ZdNxrk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; at Apple starting today, with shipments set to arrive before the tablet’s official launch on Friday, September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XTmmmK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ8Eig"&gt;Like previous models, the ninth-gen iPad also comes in a cellular configuration, which is available in both 64GB and 256GB storage capacities in one of two colors (silver and space gray). Both storage configurations are &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/ZdNxrk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; starting today at Apple, with the 64GB variant retailing for $459 and the 256GB model for $609.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MxvlFg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752888"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E9kfjH"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DxkRiZ"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4XyYCS"&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dN7cX0"&gt;Apple just finished its “California Streaming” event, and it announced a whole lot of new products, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; lineup of smartphones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watches&lt;/a&gt; with bigger screen, and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tri6hY"&gt;If you’re looking for a quick recap of the biggest news from the show, we’ve got you covered right here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UQW7u1"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;The iPhone 13 has a familiar design with a smaller notch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="09Enon"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini look very similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, but have a smaller notch and a diagonal camera array. They’re equipped with the new A15 Bionic chip and have an improved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673545/iphone-13-pro-camera-cinematic-mode-video-features-macro"&gt;dual-camera system&lt;/a&gt; on the back. Apple is also promising longer battery life than the iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnLMHB"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729, and the iPhone 13 starts at $829, though both are more affordable with carrier discounts. You can pre-order them on September 17th ahead of availability on September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/75c0asfqo09ttawxM97-OtDkiXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850316/bHfOSj7.png"&gt;

&lt;p id="kWDpOZ"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max look similar to their predecessors, with a stainless steel band around the sides and a matte finish on the back. But the big upgrade is the screen — they support Apple’s ProMotion adaptive refresh rate technology that tops out at 120Hz. They also have a new camera system and an A15 Bionic chip. Like the iPhone 13, Apple is also promising improved battery life from the iPhone 12 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqFux5"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the Pro Max starts at $1,099, and you can get both in a new 1TB storage option. The phones will be available to pre-order on September 17th, and they’ll be out on September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1nvdFE"&gt;Two key new camera features coming to the iPhone 13 lineup are Cinematic Mode, which applies a portrait mode-style blur to the background, and something Apple calls photographic styles, which lets you select different styles before you take a photo to give it a certain look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WSxuKh"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 comes in two bigger screen sizes — 41mm and 45mm — with a slightly tweaked design. Some elements of the UI have been updated to better accommodate the bigger screen, including showing a full keyboard at times. The new model starts at $399, but you can’t get it just yet. Apple says it will be available later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3VJtuP"&gt;Apple announced some updates coming to Fitness Plus, its workout service. Apple is adding Pilates workouts, guided meditations, and workouts inspired by winter sports to the service later this month. Group workouts, coming later this fall, will let you work out with your friends. And the service is expanding to more countries, also later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NI4cSq"&gt;Apple’s new iPad Mini has an all-new design that resembles the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; that was released in 2020. The new Mini has an 8.3-inch screen, a Touch ID sensor on the power button, a USB-C port, a 12MP ultrawide front camera that supports Apple’s Center Stage technology, and the option of 5G connectivity. It also supports the second-generation Apple Pencil, which can connect magnetically to the side of the tablet. The new tablet starts at $499. It will be available to order Tuesday ahead of availability on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is releasing watchOS 8 on September 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1k0ZQtT__1hJrZNNrbPl7-mnh8E=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857640/lcimg_e0eb6a55_c77c_4513_86a9_1373f1fd5bb0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aNYsAO"&gt;Apple is releasing the next version of its smartwatch operating system, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/watchos-8-brings-new-access-connectivity-and-mindfulness-features-to-apple-watch/"&gt;September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The company first introduced the new free update at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; and has been testing it in public beta over the summer alongside iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3RVSE"&gt;watchOS 8 is a modest change to the Apple Watch, but it still has some nice additions. Apple is adding support for new iOS 15 features like Focus mode for more granular control over app notifications and new types of keys and ID cards in Apple Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyFBly"&gt;The new watchOS is also getting new watchfaces to take advantage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7’s larger screen&lt;/a&gt; and new workout types for Pilates and tai chi (along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673993/apple-fitness-plus-workouts-countries-languages-pilates-snow"&gt;other updates to Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;). The Apple Watch is also getting a spruced-up Mindfulness app that combines features from the previous Breathe feature with new ways to relax. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is releasing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 on September 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0CSra39oejILjbC-WWVspx8PFWo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857603/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O3b1aE"&gt;Apple says it’s releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-with-breakthrough-performance-in-stunning-new-design/"&gt;September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The company announced the new free operating system updates at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; earlier in June and offered public betas over the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJPbqF"&gt;Both of the new versions of iOS and iPadOS offer a grab bag of features. The headliners include changes to notifications like the addition of notification summaries, Focus modes for creating distinct lists of apps and notifications allowed to reach users at different times of the day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;improvements to FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; that include the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;invite Android and Windows users&lt;/a&gt; to calls for the first time, and a new look for Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vW1lJs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A features grab bag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ILFLD"&gt;On the iPad, iPadOS 15 finally brings iOS 14 features like the app library and resizable widgets, and the other previously mentioned goodies Apple has planned for iOS 15. As part of the update, Apple is once again tweaking how multitasking works, with a new menu for split screen, and a “shelf” for organizing apps that offer separate windows, like Safari. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YteJug"&gt;Some features for both iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 will take a bit longer to arrive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;Apple says SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to share video and audio live over FaceTime calls, is slated for later this fall.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro is the first iPhone with 1TB of storage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDFzpLv05LVFb8HlB3JeNO_7VF8=/116x0:1318x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857579/cCGjh1M.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gh8in0"&gt;Apple announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;new iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; handset today during the company’s California Streaming event. It’s the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage as an option, allowing owners to store double the maximum capacity of 512GB on the regular iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTgdWa"&gt;Apple has previously offered 1TB for iPad storage but has kept the 512GB maximum on the iPhone Pro side until today. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670072/apple-iphone-13-pro-models-1tb-storage-kuo"&gt;Rumors had suggested&lt;/a&gt; we’d get a 1TB iPhone this year, and it comes two years after Samsung shipped its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18229628/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-price-full-specs-storage"&gt;Galaxy S10 Plus&lt;/a&gt; with a 1TB storage option for $1,600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyzWvZ"&gt;Apple is also bumping iPhone storage on the standard models. The base iPhone 13 model will now ship with 128GB instead of the 64GB storage found on the iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HLo1K"&gt;Apple’s iPhone Pro 13 will start at $999 and is shipping on September 24th. The 1TB storage option will be available on the iPhone 13 Pro for $1,499 and $1,599 on the larger iPhone 13 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13’s new camera tricks include cinematic video and macro photography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Un_8IR1cPAm0pRvKn3ypZ5ygUY=/281x0:1780x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857560/camera.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JEHvhP"&gt;With a design that’s largely similar to last year’s phones, Apple is leaning on big upgrades &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; lineups to get people excited. Some of the most substantial improvements to the 2021 iPhones are found in the camera(s), and the company today announced several new features that will produce better still photographs and videos on the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXkYeb"&gt;The first is a new “cinematic mode” for video that replicates the rack focus effect commonly seen in movies. The iPhone 13 smoothly transitions between forefront and background focus based on what’s occurring in the frame. The system is intelligent enough to change focus when a subject looks away from the phone. You can also manually tap to change or lock focus on your preferred subject. Cinematic mode is also available on the iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQjwlq01LQMDbrzbYVqZse1ZoEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850277/cinematicvideo.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinematic mode intelligently shifts between foreground and background focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7PfeMU"&gt;On all iPhone 13 models, a depth map is built into the cinematic mode video file, giving you the option of changing the focus point after the fact. And for the iPhone 13 Pro, Apple is introducing a macro photography feature that can focus on subjects as close as two centimeters away from the lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSANZT"&gt;The 13 Pro is also gaining new “photographic styles” that apply different adjustments across scenes and subject types, letting you set your favorite visual effects and maintain them across your future shots. Later this year, Apple will roll out ProRes video support on the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, giving video creators more leeway in post-processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d47FGa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction September 14th, 3:23PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article originally stated that changing focus after the fact for cinematic mode video recordings is only available on the iPhone 13 Pro models. This feature is also possible on the iPhone 13 and 13 mini. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is getting Group Workouts and Pilates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3oqT0MfHuSsJhghI9v_7n7eRCs=/213x0:2301x1392/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857547/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_10.35.45_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tIrUqk"&gt;Apple has announced a Group Workouts feature for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Fitness Plus will also be coming to 15 new countries, including Brazil, France, Mexico, and Russia, and workouts will be getting subtitles in six languages. There are new workouts, including guided meditation, Pilates, and programs to help you prepare for winter sports like skiing and snowboarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftiCN8"&gt;Group Workouts will let Fitness Plus subscribers do a workout with a friend (or a group of up to 32 people), starting it through an iMessage or FaceTime call. On your screen, you’ll be able to see both the instructor and the people with whom you’re sharing the workout. (Hopefully Apple will include an option to turn your camera off if it gets too embarrassing.) You’ll also see your metrics and rings, and you’ll be able to see how your friends are doing on the “burn bar” competition feature and when they close their rings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8482MJgCqXGJ3aHvWe9Yyh7FpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850255/lcimg_cfac3cae_b68c_43d1_bc9f_efbb09578a02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now friends and family can see how much I struggle with cardio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PegOdX"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple hasn’t announced a way to let two people share a workout on the same screen, though you likely could share a workout with a roommate or family member if you each have your own device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eg1_Kw3HSjffGZUViY2BJzs1IW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850268/lcimg_5d8283a0_fdee_4540_b161_d937e74db109.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitness Plus will soon be available in these countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4zoOU"&gt;To go with the new guided meditation workout, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;upcoming Mindfulness app&lt;/a&gt; will include audio versions of the mediations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eksMqF"&gt;Group Workouts and support for new countries will be coming “later this fall,” which makes sense as Apple already announced that SharePlay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;won’t be launching with iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the features will be coming out later this month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max announced with high refresh rate 120Hz displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KT2X-gvGS17lneGO-3UDXAvi8Fs=/147x0:1737x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857534/bHfOSj7.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u07Yi5"&gt;Apple has officially announced the high-end half of the iPhone 13 lineup: the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. They’ve got a faster A15 Bionic chip, three all-new cameras, and an improved display with up to a 120Hz ProMotion high refresh rate that can go as bright as 1,000 nits. The iPhone 13 Pro will start at $999, while the iPhone 13 Pro Max will start at $1,099. Both will be available to order on Friday, shipping on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9Shn0"&gt;The Super Retina XDR displays on both models support variable refresh rates of between 10Hz and 120Hz, and are the same size as last year at 6.1 and 6.7 inches. They have slightly smaller notches that should allow for more space in the iOS status bar. The phones will be available in four colors: graphite, gold, silver, and a new light blue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4kFxQHWCmhuj_LP5WYeyZ2d-yI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850327/57Qm3gz6bg.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QSTueU"&gt;Apple says the phones have an all-new three-camera system. The wide camera should offer better low-light photography thanks to its bigger sensor, while the ultrawide should see improvements, too, thanks to its wider aperture. The phones’ telephoto camera now goes up to 3x zoom, enabling 6x optical zoom across the three cameras. All three cameras now have night mode, and there’s a new macro mode for photographing subjects at just 2cm. Sensor-shift optical image stabilization is included on both models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="is9DJe"&gt;On the software side, Apple has announced a new Photographic Styles feature, which looks like it works a little like traditional camera filters with an added dose of computational photography. On the video side, the cinematic focus feature announced for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; will also be available on the 13 Pro and Pro Max. The iPhone 13 Pro will also be able to film in up to 4K / 30fps in ProRes, a higher quality video format that gives video editors more control when tweaking footage after it’s been shot. However, the base 128GB storage option will &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005966/en/Apple-Unveils-iPhone-13-Pro-and-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-%E2%80%94-More-Pro-Than-Ever-Before"&gt;top out at 1080p / 30fps&lt;/a&gt;. Apple says ProRes support will be available “in a future iOS 15 update.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UovY90"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKfgdkcIUxw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GFC3WJ"&gt;Internally, both devices are using Apple’s new A15 Bionic chip, which offers the familiar CPU and GPU speed increases compared to last year. Apple also says the chip should be faster for machine learning tasks. Battery life has also been improved, with the 13 Pro lasting 1.5 hours longer than the 12 Pro, and the 13 Pro Max lasting 2.5 hours longer than the 12 Pro Max on a charge. Storage options for the iPhone 13 Pro range from 128GB up to 1TB, the most storage Apple has ever offered on a phone. 5G performance has also been upgraded with support for more bands, which Apple says should provide better coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtNAGq"&gt;This is the third year Apple is splitting its flagship phone lineup into regular and “Pro” devices. Last year, however, many reviewers noted that there wasn’t much of a difference between the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the 12 Pro had an extra telephoto camera, lidar sensor, and more RAM and base storage, but its basic design, processor, 5G capabilities, and OLED display were all similar, if not identical, to the regular iPhone 12. &lt;/p&gt;
