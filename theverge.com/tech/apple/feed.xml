    <title>Vimeo adds support for Apple’s iPhone 12 Dolby Vision HDR videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini has a regular wide and an ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-Gy_9aMsw9Dm47hIAqACFBvhLw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840216/vpavic_4279_20201107_0048.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4R5Lr"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro launched last year with the ability to shoot video in Dolby Vision HDR — but for the most part, there hasn’t been anywhere to actually post or share those files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14OZyd"&gt;But now, almost a year after they were first announced (and just in time for Apple’s next iPhone announcement on Tuesday), &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fblog%2Fpost%2Fdolby-vision-support-apple-devices&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F10%2F22666520%2Fvimeo-apple-iphone-12-pro-dolby-vision-hdr-videos-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple, Dolby, and Vimeo are teaming up&lt;/a&gt; to allow iPhone 12 owners to post &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F601088734&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F10%2F22666520%2Fvimeo-apple-iphone-12-pro-dolby-vision-hdr-videos-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dolby Vision HDR videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syg9w4"&gt;Starting now, you’ll be able to upload Dolby Vision videos shot with iPhone 12 devices (either directly from an iPhone or from your computer after editing in a program like Final Cut Pro) to Vimeo, where anyone will be able to stream them. Dolby Vision videos on Vimeo will have a badge highlighting that they feature HDR content, so you’ll easily be able to tell (and to show off) the improved video quality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lTDWjZh8OtaerctVvkMv9Jzzd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839932/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_11.18.27_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JemWCk"&gt;Of course, you’ll still need a Dolby Vision-compatible device to &lt;em&gt;watch&lt;/em&gt; your iPhone 12-shot videos on, which (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;as Nilay noted in his review&lt;/a&gt;) can be a tricky bit of business. Furthermore, Vimeo is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; supporting Apple devices to start: an iPhone 8 or newer or second-gen iPad Pro. Alternatively, the company says that you can use an HDR-compatible Mac (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210980"&gt;see Apple’s list here&lt;/a&gt;) or an Apple TV 4K if you’ve got a Dolby Vision TV or display to connect them to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnz5FB"&gt;On the flip side, if you have another Dolby Vision streaming device (or a Windows computer), you still won’t be able to view Dolby Vision videos on Vimeo. For now, the feature is only available on iOS, tvOS, and macOS devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oqml6E"&gt;But even if you’re still mostly stuck watching videos on Apple devices, the newly added Vimeo support means that it’ll at least be easier to share and view those Dolby Vision HDR videos, instead of requiring that you share files to a friend to view on their iPhone or iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcCxds"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple must allow other forms of in-app purchases, rules judge in Epic v. Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ywPT_LKUcPUv2PxMKUNofqbq7fs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840077/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhwS4B"&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060628-epic-apple-injunction"&gt;a permanent injunction&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case on Friday morning, putting new restrictions on Apple’s App Store rules and bringing months of bitter legal jousting to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K45KuA"&gt;Under the new order, Apple is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="o8d1Ip"&gt;permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3PKLf8"&gt;In short, iOS apps must be allowed to direct users to payment options beyond those offered by Apple. The injunction is scheduled to take effect in 90 days — on December 9th — unless it is enjoined by a higher court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JZ0NQ2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rCrbJe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060697-apple-epic-judgment"&gt;In a separate judgment&lt;/a&gt;, the court affirmed that Epic Games was in breach of its contract with Apple when it implemented the alternative payment system in the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; app. As a result, Epic must pay Apple 30 percent of all revenue collected through the system since it was implemented — a sum of more than $3.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PPUKK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060631-apple-epic-judgement"&gt;In the full ruling&lt;/a&gt;, Judge Gonzalez Rogers explained her thinking on the issue in greater detail. Notably, the judge rejected both parties’ definition of the marketplace at issue in the case. “The relevant market here is digital mobile gaming transactions, not gaming generally and not Apple’s own internal operating systems related to the App Store,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z37QEc"&gt;Under that market definition, “the court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws,” she continued. “Nonetheless, the trial did show that Apple is engaging in anti-competitive conduct under California’s competition laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPgBwA"&gt;Reached for comment, Apple cast the ruling as a victory for the App Store model. “Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law,” a representative said. “Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world. We remain committed to ensuring the App Store is a safe and trusted marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZYfhP"&gt;On Twitter, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney expressed disappointment in the order. “Today’s ruling isn’t a win for developers or for consumers,” Sweeney said. “Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers.” Separately, an Epic Games spokesperson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1436386058317402112"&gt;told NPR&lt;/a&gt; that the company plans to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xnw77f"&gt;The new restrictions include echoes of some provisional anti-steering restrictions already placed on Apple outside of the US. On September 1st, Apple agreed to allow outside signup links for “reader” apps like Netflix and Spotify, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;a regulatory investigation in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;a South Korean law&lt;/a&gt; opened the door to alternate payment systems, although the practical impacts of the law are still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njgk3L"&gt;Apple and Epic Games have been at odds for years over the transaction fee system in the iOS App Store, which Apple sees as a necessary operating cost but Epic sees as a monopolistic tax. The fight came to a head in August 2020 when Epic installed an alternative payment system in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to circumvent the App Store’s transaction fees. Apple responded by removing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the App Store, which sparked an immediate legal complaint from Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sjbe9m"&gt;The subsequent trial was a brutal tug-of-war over the App Store model and Apple’s efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;maintain control over software on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things, we learned about Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;strange accounting methods&lt;/a&gt; and charm offensive to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;keep major players like Netflix using in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6gxfC"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Epic v. Apple trial was bigger than Fortnite|102313" data-volume-uuid="2e5d0ec67" data-volume-id="102313" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-386" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tdb9LQ"&gt;The ruling is likely to have significant impacts outside of Apple. Google is already facing a similar lawsuit from Epic Games over its own efforts to maintain the Google Play Store as the central source of software on Android, drawing on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;elaborate deals with phone manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 15’s Focus modes to quickly customize your iPhone’s homescreen </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gltTt7-rJuCV6Eru_gO-CpXHqyk=/6x0:2034x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839544/twarren_ios14widgets.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KscCOx"&gt;Customizing your iPhone’s homescreen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21448712/customize-iphone-home-screen-app-icons-widget-ios14"&gt;took off last year&lt;/a&gt; when iOS 14 introduced widgets and the ability to hide default app icons in favor of your own cool, customized ones. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; opens up a new dimension to homescreen customization, thanks to Focus modes — which give a quick and easy way to hide and reveal groups of homescreens with just a single tap. Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAEVvN"&gt;Focus modes are ostensibly an extension of Apple’s Do Not Disturb mode — the intended idea behind the feature is that you can tie specific homescreens to different use cases, like having a work homescreen with your calendar and email widgets that automatically pop up when you’re in the office, and a regular homescreen with social media apps and music widgets for when you’re off the clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0KNUM"&gt;But since Focus modes let you choose homescreens, you can also use them to quickly swap between a slate of custom-themed icons that you’ve made with matching shortcuts and widgets, without having to manually hide all your homepages every time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKn1sJ"&gt;To use the new feature, you’ll first need to set up a Focus mode — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"&gt;fortunately, we’ve already got a guide here&lt;/a&gt; on how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zATjrr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use Focus modes for notifications on iOS 15","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pSu6wg"&gt;You’ll also need to set up your themed homescreen with widgets and custom icons, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change"&gt;which you can learn how to do here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ptSivc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to customize your iPhone’s app icons","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="AK2oT3"&gt;Once you’ve done all that, you’ll want to go to Settings &amp;gt; Focus, select the specific Focus you want to use to trigger your custom homescreen or screens. Then select the Home Screen menu, toggle the “Custom Pages” switch, and select the homepages you’d like to appear when you enable the Focus mode. Then, all you have to do is turn on your Focus mode, and your phone will turn into your perfect themed style whenever you’d like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfPmGx"&gt;If you’re really willing to go the extra mile, though, you can take advantage of Shortcuts and create an automation that changes your iOS wallpaper whenever you turn on that Focus mode. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work great — at least with the current iOS 15 beta — but it is an option for those willing to muck around with Shortcuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGA1iL"&gt;All of this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still a lot of effort for a themed homescreen, of course. But unless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451649/apple-ios-14-widgets-custom-app-icons-shortcuts-design-jailbreaking-wallpaper"&gt;Apple relents and gives us better customization tools next year&lt;/a&gt;, the new tricks in iOS 15 are the best way to get your homescreen looking stylish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3iBhv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is now available for the lowest price yet in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVt8BXx7RQzj8cl9pq1P2rxEWX8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839164/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is no longer the latest model, but its value is hard to beat. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bblCn7"&gt;The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K has long been considered one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;best streaming devices&lt;/a&gt; on the market, especially if you’re already tapped into Amazon’s ecosystem. The arrival of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662985/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-announced-features-price"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; may complicate things next month, however, if you couldn’t care less about Wi-Fi 6 and improved processing power, the current model should suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I94XLn"&gt;As far as specs go, the last-gen Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K checks all the boxes. The 4K streamer offers everything HDR (Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10), as well as Dolby Atmos sound, access to all major streaming apps, and an Alexa-enabled remote that lets you issue commands without having to shout across your living room. Normally $50, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is now on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfybDjfQNAO#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $35&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the lowest price we’ve seen on the budget-friendly streaming device to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vqNBJZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10710076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjvmu8"&gt;The school year may have already begun, but if you’re still in need of a competent laptop with fantastic battery life, Apple’s M1-equipped MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is back down to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$850 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. Our team thinks the 2020 Air is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, with lightning-fast performance, a tried-and-true clamshell design, and a battery that allows for a full day of work or play before it needs to be recharged via USB-C. Sure, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, September 14th, might bring a few MacBook surprises — potentially even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; — but, in the meantime, the latest model should be more than enough for most people. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HPgnco"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 39,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="03WruI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="riZ5tC"&gt;The original HomePod may have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;met its demise earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but the HomePod Mini lives on. And if you’re looking to pick up Apple’s scaled-down smart speaker in lieu of an Amazon or Google device, Best Buy is currently offering the Siri-equipped HomePod Mini alongside a Philips Hue Lightstrip Plus Starter Kit for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfx5Ky0zA6i#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, a healthy $30 off the bundle’s list price. The starter kit — which includes a power adapter and a Philips Hue Bridge — is also compatible with the HomePod Mini, meaning not only can it use Apple’s compact speaker to play music and answer questions, but it can control your lighting via HomeKit. Like all products in the current Philips Hue lineup, the flexible light strip can showcase an array of 16 million colors, ensuring you can always find one that strikes your mood. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our HomePod Mini review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YXnnJC"&gt;If the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393879/polaroid-go-instant-camera-tiny-selfie-timer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced Polaroid Go&lt;/a&gt; is any indication, instant cameras are far from over. And while Fujifilm might not have been in the game for quite as long as Polaroid, Fujifilm’s current Instax lineup offers a heavy dose of old-school nostalgia at a more affordable price point. Typically $88, you can pick up the Fujifilm Instax Wide 300 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TGOWK3Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon today with delayed shipping for $75&lt;/a&gt;, the second-steepest discount it has received since its debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xDf7F"&gt;Film-wise, the battery-powered instant camera uses a larger Instax Wide film that’s about twice the size of a credit card. That means you can use it for various types of photography, whether it be fashion, landscape, or portraiture. Other noteworthy features include a tripod socket, an image finder, and a dial that allows you to better adjust the focus. It’s not as portable as some of the competition, but if you’re looking for a simple instant camera that’s cheaper than &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Instant-Camera-16670522/dp/B08G5YV1Q6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fujifilm’s newer Instax Square SQ1&lt;/a&gt;, the Instax Wide 300 is a solid contender.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly overcomes Watch Series 7 manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sw59Vp6iuCSMLr2W7hB1I19xOFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838523/apple_watch_series_6_dbohn_821.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year’s Apple Watch Series 6.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hnmit8"&gt;Apple has reportedly overcome the production issues it’s been having with its unreleased smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 7, and will now begin mass manufacturing the device in mid-September, according to a report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/kuo-apple-watch-series-7-ship-late-sept/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes as Apple gears up for a major launch event on September 14th. The fall event will presumably be focused on its latest iPhone models with the new Apple Watch also expected to make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAzCXE"&gt;Late last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had temporarily halted production of its latest smartwatch while it fixed the problems. The issues were thought to be related to the Series 7’s revamped design, which is said to consist of “&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;a flatter display and edges&lt;/a&gt;” than seen on previous models. The new design has reportedly forced Apple to use new production processes that created “reliability issues” in early test runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bzzk4o"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On Watch 7 from last weekend: “We’ll see an announcement during the usual September event alongside the iPhone, but there will be a mix of the models shipping late or in small quantities.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/xkvN14Mv3O"&gt;https://t.co/xkvN14Mv3O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LGjrET"&gt;Now, however, these issues are thought to have been resolved, with shipments expected to begin in late September. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, however, although Apple will announce the new Watch next week, some of the models could ship “late or in small quantities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0nXvk"&gt;As well as the flatter display, the new smartwatch is expected to come with slightly larger 41mm and 45mm cases (up from 40mm and 44mm currently), bumping the largest display from 1.78 inches to 1.9 inches diagonally. The watches are also rumored to have a faster processor and updated wireless tech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music is adding more DJ mixes with new features powered by Shazam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2ZQnxXtXtKmSK-HQGqIANMbcsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838305/acastro_210831_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="quFQc3"&gt;Last year Apple showed how it could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;embed Shazam’s music identification features even more deeply within iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s taking things another step forward within Apple Music. Apple Music initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11235428/apple-music-stream-remixes-dj-mixes-dubset"&gt;introduced DJ mixes and mash-ups in 2016 through a partnership with Dubset Media Holdings&lt;/a&gt; to identify and pay for licensed music within mixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj1TvW"&gt;Now Apple says that by building upon the Shazam tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;acquired in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and partnering with various labels, Apple Music has the tools to identify and compensate individual creators, event promoters, labels, etc. It also allows subscribers to see the names of individual tracks, skip songs within the mix, listen with lossless audio on “most mixes,” and save them to their library for viewing offline. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cNlCJzWhvaL4iJTap0cLoW47L58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839129/applemusic_6001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Music DJ Mix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mQg5zT"&gt;So yes, the same fingerprint ID tech that tells you the name of a song playing in the mall can apparently figure out which festival it’s from, which DJ’s mix it is, and pick out different sounds as they blend together. This is apparently detailed enough, relying on matching across Apple Music’s database of 75 million songs or so, to enable recurring revenue streams for the clubs that host sets and the DJs that make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTumey"&gt;There’s a dedicated genre page for DJ mixes within the Apple Music app, and the company says engagement has tripled in the last twelve months, with over 300 million streams of DJ mixes so far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Un-C3A-NrrZPin1pIWYhKSifwl0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839132/applemusic_600t.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Music DJ Mix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHBPrU"&gt;Apple has already been on a tear adding mixes over the last year or so, including some from Charlotte de Witte, Tiësto, Carl Cox, and others. Studio K7! founder Horst Weidenmueller said in a statement that “Through the partnership with Apple we finally have a place to celebrate DJ-Kicks with additional 14 editions which haven‘t been in the market for over 15 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PERn2v"&gt;Apple Music says it’s commissioning more mixes (following series released earlier this year to mark Black Music Month and Pride) and working closely with DJs to get additional content on the service. This is a new path for getting DJ mixes onto Apple Music alongside older ones like Dubset’s platform. If you already enjoy existing mixes on Apple Music, we’re told they aren’t going anywhere, even if they don’t have all the new features included. Still, it isn’t yet accessible for bedroom DJs or lesser-known names posting their mixtapes to SoundCloud, so there’s some room between this and the wild days of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muxtape"&gt;Muxtape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple won’t let Epic bring Fortnite back to South Korea’s App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EXYdbBwcc_0-tFM38okb09faDjw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838257/vpavic_180607_2652_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLYuio"&gt;Apple says it won’t let Epic Games back in the App Store until they agree to “play by the same rules as everyone else.” Earlier today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665826/epic-games-apple-reinstate-fortnite-ios-korea-app-store-payment"&gt;Epic asked Apple&lt;/a&gt; to reinstate its developer account so that it could re-release the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in South Korea, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; forcing Apple and Google to allow alternate in-app payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BVTLT"&gt;Apple, however, maintains it’s under no obligation to let Epic in the App Store at all. “As we’ve said all along, we would welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,” an Apple spokesperson says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Epic has admitted to breach of contract and as of now, there’s no legitimate basis for the reinstatement of their developer account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="N0dBfY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"All the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Yl5sa3"&gt;The South Korean legislation has not yet gone into effect, but if and when it does, according to Apple, that wouldn’t have any bearing on the company’s process for approving developer accounts. Until Epic agrees to comply with the App Store’s app review guidelines, Apple isn’t going to consider its request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlEPyh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most popular video games in the world, has been unavailable on the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;since August of last year&lt;/a&gt;. Apple ultimately terminated Epic’s developer account in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; update&lt;/a&gt; that dodged the App Store’s in-app payment requirement in order to get around paying Apple the 30-percent cut. Epic then sued Apple and went to trial in May, with a verdict yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fires senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly leaking information</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MpOe7Q2Tn1pUSlE7lq2TwQwZi2A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838038/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xfqpAL"&gt;Apple has fired senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly violating the company’s rules against leaking confidential information. For months, Gjøvik has been tweeting openly about allegations of harassment, surveillance, and workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fO2x3"&gt;“When I began raising workplace safety concerns in March, and nearly immediately faced retaliation and intimidation, I started preparing myself for something exactly like this to happen,” she says. “I’m disappointed that a company I have loved since I was a little girl would treat their employees this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0K58X"&gt;Gjøvik has raised concerns that her office is in an Apple building located on a superfund site, meaning it requires special oversight due to historical waste contamination. She also says that she faced harassment and bullying from her manager and members of her team. More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;she’s begun raising privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; related to Apple’s policies on how it can search and surveil employees’ work phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0nYUnz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sooo, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; has pics of my boobs. During a discovery thing 3yr ago, legal forced me to hand-over all my texts. They refused to let me delete anything, even "fully personal," even when I said "by fully personal I mean nudes." They said they're in their "permanent evidence locker"&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1428495420917837826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4dviGK"&gt;She was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610112/apple-female-engineering-manager-leave-sexism-work-environment"&gt;placed on administrative leave in early August&lt;/a&gt; while Apple investigated some of these concerns — a placement she says she requested as a last resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ayee9"&gt;A member of Apple’s employee relations team reached out to Gjøvik earlier today saying the company was looking into a sensitive intellectual property matter and wanted to speak to her within the hour. Gjøvik said she wanted to keep all communications in writing, and noted she was forwarding the correspondence along to the NLRB, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;where she recently filed a charge&lt;/a&gt;. The employee relations representative responded to say that because she had chosen not to participate in the discussion, they would move forward with the information they had and — “given the seriousness of these allegations” — suspend her access to Apple systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TWdgdI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Any bets if I get a literal knock on my physical door from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; today? &lt;a href="https://t.co/oFqw4VFaGi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oFqw4VFaGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1436078307859066890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXSOMR"&gt;Hours later, Gjøvik received an email that her employment at Apple was being terminated, effective tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDhGAH"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock said: “We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAkiU5"&gt;Epic Games has asked Apple to reinstate its &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer account so it can release the game in South Korea, following the passage of a bill that will force Apple and Google to let apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;use alternative payment systems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Epic intends to re-release Fortnite on iOS in Korea offering both Epic payment and Apple payment side-by-side in compliance with the new Korean law.&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1436105346184056832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rGDyc8"&gt;It’s unclear if Apple will agree to the request, or if Epic’s intentions are genuine: after all, Epic used Apple’s responses to its prior demands &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;to help spring its original #FreeFortnite legal trap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZdOAo"&gt;In August 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; hours after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;Epic introduced a direct payment system&lt;/a&gt; to the game that bypassed Apple’s own. Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;then sued Apple&lt;/a&gt;, starting off a contentious legal battle between the two companies. The case went to trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;, and we are still awaiting a verdict. The entire time, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t been on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfsEsi"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch exec takes over secretive car project</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svd8NW"&gt;Just two days after Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661291/apple-car-chief-ford-doug-field"&gt;hired away Doug Field, the head of Apple’s secretive car project&lt;/a&gt;, the tech giant has tapped Apple Watch exec and former Adobe CTO Kevin Lynch to take his place, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-09/apple-s-watch-software-chief-takes-over-self-driving-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4s1eN"&gt;It’s the latest changing of the guard for the project, known as Project Titan, which has rotated leaders about as much as it has reportedly shifted focus. To wit, Korea’s &lt;em&gt;Maeil Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/apple-chose-to-develop-apple-car-alone/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier Thursday that Apple may no longer be trying to work with other automakers to bring its autonomous electric car to life. Rather, the report states, Apple now plans to go it alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tpGcU"&gt;Lynch started working on the project in July, when he was brought on to help develop the vehicle’s software. He joined Apple in 2013 from Adobe, where he was the company’s chief technology officer. While there, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4124972/adobe-cto-kevin-lynch-allegedly-leaving-to-join-apples-ranks"&gt;he somewhat famously wrote Adobe’s official response&lt;/a&gt; to Apple’s decision to keep Flash out of iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="armIzd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lynch wrote Adobe’s defense of putting Flash on ios, once upon a time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bHNbMM"&gt;Curiously, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;writes that Lynch still reports to Apple’s chief operating officer Jeff Williams and not John Giannandrea, the company’s head of AI — who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;was tapped last year to oversee the car project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gsfmvh"&gt;Field, meanwhile, ran Project Titan from 2018 up until this week when he was poached by Ford. Before that, he spent years at Tesla helping bring cars like the Model 3 to market. (Before that, he worked at... Apple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKqP82"&gt;Launched in 2014 as a reported effort to build an electric car, Apple eventually pivoted the project to focus on the self-driving technology stack. But recently, it seems to have pivoted back, striking up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;conversations with major Asian automakers along the way&lt;/a&gt; (as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;considering buying electric vehicle startup Canoo&lt;/a&gt;). At this point, though, it might as well exist in a quantum state to anyone not actually working on the project. Until it’s observed, the Apple Car is both everything and nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
