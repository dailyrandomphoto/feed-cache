    <title>Apple to stop selling iMac Pro base model, which is listed as available ‘while supplies last’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crCdu2"&gt;In a sign that the iMac Pro is on the way out, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F6%2F22316831%2Fapple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only model currently available&lt;/a&gt; for purchase on the Apple Store website is the $4,999 base configuration, “while supplies last.” As first &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/06/apple-discontinues-imac-pro-apple-store-says-buy-while-supplies-last/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all build-to-order configurations for the iMac Pro have been removed from Apple’s site (but may still be available at third-party retailers like Amazon). Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; once supplies of the base model run out, iMac Pro will no longer be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FC56W-wMtMpr1uWQt3-A1zlWfTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22349982/buy_imac_pro.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A screengrab of the Apple Store listing for the iMac Pro on March 6th, 2021&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O0NIJ2"&gt;It’s not a huge surprise that Apple may be phasing out the iMac Pro; there have been well-sourced reports that the company will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;introducing a redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt; and doing a revamp of the Mac Pro sometime this year. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported in January&lt;/a&gt; that the overhaul would get rid of the “chin” beneath the screen, and have a flat-back design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3wXiN"&gt;Apple hasn’t officially deemed the iMac Pro as discontinued, but it’s unusual for the company to use “while supplies last” in its product listings. In the meantime, the 27-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353899/apple-imac-2020-webcam-price-specs-release-date-announcement"&gt;iMac introduced in August&lt;/a&gt; is a solid option Apple says is popular among professional iMac users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTSizt"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15741540/apple-imac-pro-announced-price-specs-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;launched the iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 with an eye toward gaming, VR, and high-end editing and graphics work. It was first unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference that year, with Apple touting it as “the most powerful Mac ever,” replacing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission"&gt;outdated Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to run a battery life report on your Windows laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XFhRLRTU_TPv314udxi31dIGur4=/0x0:1401x934/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68920093/2021_03_05_12_57_46_Window.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLEqZP"&gt;When my editor told me about Window’s built-in battery report, my first thought was: “How have I never heard of this before? Also, that sounds pretty useful!” So I looked at the guide he sent (&lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/generate-battery-report-windows-10"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Laptop Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and tried it out. It ended up being just as interesting as it sounded, so I figured I’d share, in case you also haven't come across this handy built-in tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vVa2I"&gt;Windows has been keeping track of how your laptop’s battery is doing since it was installed. The report, which you can run using just two command prompt commands, will show how many cycles you’ve used on your battery and how it’s been used in the past three days. It will also give you a picture of what Windows estimates your battery life &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;be versus what it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBdzup"&gt;So if you’re curious about your battery status or you’ve been noticing that your battery life has been a bit of a drag lately and are wondering if it’s due to neglect or some power virus on your computer sucking back a bunch of juice, this report should let you know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BS1W6n"&gt;First, open the Command Prompt tool. To do that, you can search “CMD” from the Start menu, and click on Command Prompt to open it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hOBzv4"&gt;The report will be spit out as an HTML file, so we’ll want to make sure it’s easy to find. To do that, type in:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="U84nf8"&gt;cd %HOMEPATH%/Desktop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nSCkQd"&gt;This command simply navigates your current directory to your desktop, so when you generate the report, you can find it there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C5yFIG"&gt;To generate the report, type:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0iuN04"&gt;powercfg /batteryreport&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7eeRF7"&gt;This runs the powerconfig tool and tells it to spit out a battery report, which should now be sitting on your desktop as an HTML file. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0l81HX"&gt;Double-click the file to open it up in your browser (or it might ask you which program you want to open the file in, which would be your browser). Now you can see all of that sweet, sweet battery information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2harnZA_gc4oHos7EWjqSZNBLKI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348843/2021_03_05_12_58_45_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery usage graph can tell you how fast your battery drains over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idS43L5kQsUnn7xGLTXvw0Zk0Yg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348842/2021_03_05_12_58_28_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This could help you get an idea of how you use your battery or show your recent computer habits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aou0giOVBFxfinE0FN9vmQdXI-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348845/2021_03_05_12_59_16_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing the design capacity estimate versus your actual time could tell you whether it’s time to replace your battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9ES6Yz"&gt;One caveat: my laptop is used, and as a policy, I completely nuke whatever Windows install is on any laptop I buy, overwriting it with a new one. If you’ve just bought a used laptop and want to know what state the battery is in, you’ll probably want to run this tool &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; wiping Windows, as it seems the cycle count only reflects what’s happened on the current Windows install. My laptop is a 2018 model, and I’m pretty sure it’s gone through more than 177 cycles since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guYuTT"&gt;Even if you’re on a newer install, you can get a general sense of the health by looking at the design capacity and then the full charge capacity to see how different they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUR5NY"&gt;If you’re an Apple user who’s feeling left out, don’t worry: macOS lets you access some battery information, too, though there isn’t as much historical data. To see it, go to the Apple menu in the top left, and click “About This Mac.” Then click the System Report button, and under Hardware, go to Power. There, you can see the cycle count of your battery, its estimated health, and all of your current power settings. To see your battery usage graphs over the past 24 hours or 10 days, go to System Preferences and then Battery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/33ojstncKFLw3Ojat3wySNP4FIE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348871/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_1.15.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has fewer graphs built in, but you can see usage statistics in System Preferences &amp;gt; Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Jay Peters? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzjJVtEToH8cmyxn7XEX72FBRBk=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918189/jpeters_210301_4457_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How he adjusts the workspace to his needs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Wc3oae"&gt;The Verge lives on news, and Jay Peters is one of the news writers who keeps it going — searching out the latest info about what’s going on in technology, entertainment, and culture, and writing it up for the site. As with the rest of us, Jay has been doing most of his work from home over the last year — here’s how he manages it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMtXYq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1wng0"&gt;I’m a news writer here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m fortunate to get to cover all sorts of things in tech, gaming, entertainment, and more. On any given day, I might write about things like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22298495/pokemon-hardware-gadgets-pikachu-poke-ball-mini-camera-consoles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; gadgets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299339/spider-man-movie-title-no-way-home-tom-holland"&gt;Marvel movie titles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291805/chun-li-ryu-fortnite-street-fighter-mortal-kombat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins&lt;/a&gt;, or even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/25/20982612/monopoly-longest-game-ever-edition-hasbro-trolling"&gt;Monopoly Longest Game Ever edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lw0e3Y"&gt;I had a bit of a roundabout path to this job. Out of college, I worked in technology PR, got my start writing about tech at &lt;a href="https://techmeme.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techmeme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in August 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8It11H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq831Q"&gt;Getting the setup to where it is now has taken years. I’ve experimented with different desks, mice, keyboards, laptop stands, monitor arms, and even at one point attached the Nintendo Switch dock to one of the legs of the desk using velcro. And I’m always tinkering with my setup, so anything I have set up now could change down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H20O2r"&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; the desk is, it was a happy coincidence that my current apartment has a corner that’s the perfect size for this desk and the dresser (which holds things like game controllers and my notebook). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlVoCN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What adjustments have you had to make for working at home and how do you deal with distractions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LaKJz"&gt;My wife and I have been working from home since 2017, so our physical work environments haven’t changed much due to the pandemic. Because we live in a studio, though, we have to communicate every day about our schedules and meetings so that we can avoid both being on the phone at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIIsTH"&gt;To keep out distractions, I usually just put in my AirPods Pro, without sound. That’s often enough to block things so I can stay focused. But if I need a little white noise, I turn on this extended YouTube video consisting entirely of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA"&gt;ambient engine noise from the USS Enterprise from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been my go-to for years. And when I feel like working to some music, I have been turning to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0nBYI0owpeY"&gt;lo-fi remixes of video game music&lt;/a&gt; as of late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4SDwZOUp3rACZ2kxJAEFgZvDRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347061/jpeters_210226_4457_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWcnWHktfRy_NtgLYHnVYywfnOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347074/jpeters_210226_4457_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jLjAkC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself, which I see is a sitting / standing desk. How did you choose it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ4z71"&gt;It’s a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fview%2Fid%2F233%2Fs%2Fjarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo%2Fcategory%2F3%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fully Jarvis standing desk&lt;/a&gt;. I used a sitting / standing desk at my PR job and got used to being able to switch back and forth, and standing makes me feel less lazy about being parked in front of a computer all day. I also find switching between sitting and standing relieves back pain and helps with a repetitive strain injury (RSI) in my wrists that first flared up a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEmnzy"&gt;One of the best add-ons I got for the desk was the programmable memory unit, which lets me tap a button to adjust the desk to my preferred sitting and standing positions. I also got the casters (wheels) so that I could wheel it over to my and my wife’s lounge chairs, which are right behind the desk. I can bring the desk over, adjust the monitor a bit lower, and then use it to watch movies and play video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gke2wF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you have less desktop space than most of the desks we’ve seen from your colleagues. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esZcpp"&gt;Space is at a premium in my studio, so a smaller desk works better for me right now. I’m also fortunate that I can technically do my entire job with just a laptop, so I don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a bigger desk — though a keyboard, mouse, and monitor make it much easier! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8KMi0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting-looking desk chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="278I3C"&gt;It’s the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fchairs%2Fhag-capisco-chair.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Capisco Chair by HÅG&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought so, too, when I first saw it on Fully’s online store. I had no plans to buy it because of the price, which starts at $829. But I tried it out at the Fully showroom in Portland and it was my favorite chair there, so I sprung for it. Every single day, I’m glad that I did, since I can comfortably sit in it for hours and it helps a lot with my posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wsCwXH"&gt;
&lt;div id="V6qQSL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371531" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bh3IJJ"&gt;
&lt;p id="3IWtjE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KobMOI"&gt;I’ve got a new 13-inch MacBook Air with Apple’s custom M1 chip inside. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;It’s a fantastic machine&lt;/a&gt;. The only upgrade I added was 16GB of RAM. I didn’t add any onboard storage because the majority of my digital life is stored online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fK68T"&gt;The monitor is an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BZNDOO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus VS228H-P with a 21.5-inch screen&lt;/a&gt;. My Amazon account tells me I bought this all the way back in 2015, but even though it’s old, I remain very happy with it. (I will admit that I thought this was a 24-inch screen for, uh, years.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCykmp"&gt;It’s attached to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078455485/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;monitor mount from Huanuo&lt;/a&gt;, and I bought it because it was the tallest one I could find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7wSxQD"&gt;
&lt;div id="7l3USa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10349083" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NXzpJY"&gt;
&lt;p id="gP5TLb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting display setup. How did you decide on it? Does it work well for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5p4S1R"&gt;I use a single monitor because I get distracted too easily if I have more than one. I’d like to upgrade to something bigger or maybe even an ultrawide someday, though (especially now that I know I have a 21.5-inch monitor instead of a 24-inch one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSqIBS"&gt;The extremely tall monitor mount serves two purposes: it helps a lot with my posture and is highly adjustable, which means I can bring it to a lower height when I’m sitting in the chairs behind the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3SYS2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a little about the mouse you have to the right of your keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mIPfn"&gt;It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.contourdesign.com/product/unimouse/"&gt;Contour Unimouse&lt;/a&gt;. My wrists can hurt if I use a “flat” mouse for too long, so I spent a lot of time and money trying out different vertical mice to see which one was the best fit for me. I like the Unimouse a lot because of just how high it angles — the company’s website says it’s 70 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9tpAe"&gt;The mouse pad is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072C93TQL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;VictSing Ergonomic Mouse Pad&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t remember why I picked it over others, but it works great for me and it’s cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nT4SIW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re the second person I’ve seen who uses a split keyboard. Do you find it better than a traditional keyboard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67oxdT"&gt;I do! It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freestyle-Ergonomic-Mechanical-Programmable-Adjustable/dp/B07CX9KQRQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kinesis Freestyle Pro&lt;/a&gt; with the additional tenting accessories and wrist pads. I happily used the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fmicrosoft-sculpt-ergonomic-desktop%2F8xk02kz6k69w%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for years, and also tried other ergonomic keyboards like the &lt;a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2-dvorak/"&gt;Kinesis Advantage2 QD&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/"&gt;ErgoDox EZ&lt;/a&gt;. But the Freestyle Pro just feels the best to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMMkwP"&gt;I also like that I can program specific keys to macros. On the left side of my keyboard, you can see that I have crudely taped scraps of Post-It notes over some of the keys — those scraps are reminders of what I have programmed the keys to do, like Command + L to quickly highlight the link in the URL bar of my browser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eB4Ssr"&gt;
&lt;p id="oZcvCf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech (headphones, speakers, etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2F70e"&gt;During the workday, my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; hardly ever leave my ears — they’re comfortable, sound fine, and work really well with my Mac and iPhone. I have just one criticism: unlike the original AirPods, the AirPods Pro tend to fall out when I’m talking on calls or eating. Hopefully Apple tweaks the fit of the AirPods Pro a little for the next model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTe2pE"&gt;My webcam is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C920-Pro-Webcam-Black/dp/B00829D0GM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech C920 HD Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It’s great and much better than my MacBook Air’s webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgaftI"&gt;My &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q9JXWTP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C hub is the Totu 13-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. It’s honestly overkill for my needs, but it works fine. Sometimes, though, it emits a dog whistle-pitched squeal that is really annoying. And the charging pad is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CHOETECH-Wireless-Charging-Compatible-Included/dp/B07THTPJFS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=chotech&amp;amp;qid=1614707259&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Choetech charging pad&lt;/a&gt;. It works well enough, though it charges my iPhone very slowly and sometimes requires me to shift my devices around a bit until their charging indicators turn on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu4nTB"&gt;To the left of my desk are my &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/consoles/console/playstation5-digital-edition-console.3005817"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles%2Fxbox-series-x%23purchase#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/system/"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;. I have mostly only owned Nintendo consoles until recently, so I’ve been spending a lot of my pandemic free time catching up on older PlayStation and Xbox games on the PS5 and Series X. (I’m currently tearing my way through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493208/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-ps4-review-vanillaware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) They’re all sitting on an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fmalm-2-drawer-chest-white-stained-oak-veneer-10178601%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310104%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IKEA Malm two-drawer chest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZg5V1"&gt;And throughout the day, I sip water from my trusty &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hydroflask.com%2F21-oz-standard-mouth-w-sport-cap%3Fcolor%3Dblack&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310104%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hydro Flask water bottle&lt;/a&gt;. I swapped the cap for a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083F0JKA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Klean Kanteen Sport cap&lt;/a&gt;, though, which I find leaks less than Hydro Flask’s sport cap.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Find My feature could let you know if you’re the one being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uu22iw8ZbremJQTbBPB24Di5UwQ=/1006x321:2825x1534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68914440/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_12.42.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KuLOxg"&gt;Apple’s Find My app might get a new safety feature to help prevent someone from using the kinds of devices tracked in the app to stalk you instead. “Item Safety Alerts”, spotted in the iOS 14.5 beta, will notify you if an unknown device being tracked on Find My is “moving with you” so you can remove it or disable it, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/04/ios-14-5-beta-3-changes-features-airtags-find-my-item-safety-alerts-video/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fv8saz"&gt;The feature seems designed to counteract a scenario where a Find My-compatible device is hidden in a pocket or bag and then used to track someone’s movements. The Item Safety Alerts setting was found in early versions of iOS 14.3, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/04/apple-brings-back-airtags-anti-stalking-feature"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but was removed until its reappearance in iOS 14.5. The setting is enabled by default in the beta and Apple seems to want it to stay on. If you turn off the setting off, the system will warn you that unknown devices can see your location without you being notified, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1367483996905570317"&gt;Apple blogger Benjamin Mayo&lt;/a&gt; shared on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZW2Rg5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Something I hadn’t considered before: new beta includes a Item Safety setting in Find My. This is how Apple is trying to prevent 'stalking' with AirTags. If someone secretly hides a tag in your possessions, your phone will notice and warn you about it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NVJyAZlthw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NVJyAZlthw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1367483996905570317?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xsUT0a"&gt;Addressing the risk of stalking in Find My is newly important because of Apple’s plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;open up the app to third-party accessories&lt;/a&gt;. Hiding an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook in someone’s bag to track them is difficult, but a small keychain-sized device like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;Tile’s upcoming ultra wideband (UWB) tracker&lt;/a&gt; could be a lot easier. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt; could also be a candidate for misuse, and reintroducing this feature into iOS might mean they’re on their way to release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tXg8jy9k8c0dG_TGibgzY3HIsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345924/iOS_14.5_Beta_3_AirTags_Item_Safety_Alerts.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My settings screen with ‘Item Safety Alerts’ turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="PyrCdp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10318020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UyRnzj"&gt;While it’s not necessarily as powerful as a GPS beacon with a cellular radio, Apple’s Find My network may have more reach than you’d think. If an Apple device comes near one of these supported trackers, it can update its location, even if the tracker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647146/apple-find-my-app-tracker-friends-iphone-wwdc-2019"&gt;doesn’t have its own connection to the internet&lt;/a&gt;. Tile’s “Community Find” feature works similarly. AirTags could theoretically expand the reach and precision even more, with an added UWB signal in the tag that can make items easier to find behind walls and in other rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54ZRpg"&gt;There are at least a few examples where gadgets like this have been abused: In 2018, a woman in Texas noticed her ex-partner kept showing up at restaurants, other people’s houses, and even an out-of-town trip, without a clear way of knowing where she was, &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/woman-says-ex-used-tile-device-to-stalk-her/3719155/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC 13 &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. She’d later learn her ex had stashed a Tile tracker in the front console of her car, and was using it to find her. A Texas beauty queen shared &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/texas-beauty-queen-claims-stranger-targeted-tracking-device/story?id=38749046"&gt;a similar stalking story in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLyrPz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple clarifies that iOS 14.5 won’t let you permanently choose a new default music service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfwKUOnxyiybiW5YVbTtwQCpJT0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913130/akrales_190522_3444_0021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pceXmG"&gt;iOS 14.5 is in beta right now, and the first beta appeared to have a long-awaited feature: it seemed you would be able to set Spotify and other music services as the default for Siri requests. But Apple has clarified &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the feature doesn’t actually work that way. Instead, selecting a music service for Siri requests is apparently intended to improve Siri’s smarts so that it can better know your audio-listening preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="penUze"&gt;In our testing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify"&gt;the first iOS 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt;, when you would ask Siri to play a song, it would show a list of music services to play a song from. After you made your choice, Siri song requests would then play from the service you selected without requiring you to pick again. But you’re not actually picking a default service, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnCp6L"&gt;“The feature is an attempt to help Siri to learn the listening apps you want to use for different types of audio content — not just music,” according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “Perhaps you want to use Spotify to listen to music, but prefer to keep up with your podcasts in Apple Podcasts or some other third-party podcasts app. And you may want to listen to audiobooks in yet another app.” Apple’s assistant may even ask your preference again in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyDZHb"&gt;Apple also noted to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;that there’s no setting in iOS where you can set your music service default, unlike the options available for setting a default email service or browser. (We also observed this when we tested the feature with the first beta of iOS 14.5.) However, you can still ask that a song play from a specific service as part of your Siri request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAXYrI"&gt;Apple still seems to be tweaking the feature, as it was &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/17/hands-on-with-ios-14-5-beta-2-changes-and-features-video/"&gt;dropped from the second beta&lt;/a&gt; before being reintroduced this week with the third. And because it is still in beta, there’s always the chance the feature could change ahead of the final release. Apple declined to comment if it would appear in the public version of iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELyk0O"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 4th, 7:45PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Apple declined to comment on if the feature would appear in the final version of iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenHaystack is a new open-source tool that lets you create DIY AirTags on Apple’s Find My network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OpenHaystack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWv4gZcgIkCpqVS0u4KSp5A2mEM=/155x0:1748x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911699/OpenHaystack_Screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OpenHaystack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzuy7b"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;promised to open up its Find My app to third-party accessory makers&lt;/a&gt;. But ahead of that, there’s a new tool that will let anybody make their own Bluetooth tracking tag to use with the Find My network so they can track its location. &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack#installation"&gt;OpenHaystack&lt;/a&gt; is a new open-source tool developed by security researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/seemoo/seemoo/index.en.jsp"&gt;Secure Mobile Networking Lab&lt;/a&gt;, who have essentially reverse-engineered the way Apple devices register themselves to the Find My mesh network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEZeQU"&gt;It is, in short, a way to create your own DIY AirTags today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zlLXv"&gt;OpenHaystack works via a custom Mac app that can be used to track the location of custom tags that you create. As of right now, the tool has direct support to make a tracking tag using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910685/bbc-micro-bit-final-design-giving-away-to-kids"&gt;BBC micro:bit mini computer&lt;/a&gt;, though other Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device support could be added by other developers in the future. Once registered on Apple’s Find My network, the OpenHaystack app will be able to report the tag’s location just like Apple’s Find My app works for iPhones and other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvYYZC"&gt;The whole system is a bit of a hack — in the sense that it’s complex, not in the sense that it’s actually hacking anything. It uses a plugin for Apple Mail (which authenticates you as a genuine Apple user) to get the necessary access to Apple’s Find My network to create and locate the keys — so Mail needs to be running for OpenHaystack to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPS6sM"&gt;There don’t appear to be serious security implications for the Find My network itself, either (though the team has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849"&gt;submitted other bug reports to Apple&lt;/a&gt;). That doesn’t mean you should just go ahead and start using OpenHaystack, however. There’s an important disclaimer on the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XbBH78"&gt;OpenHaystack is experimental software. The code is untested and incomplete. For example, OpenHaystack tags using our &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware"&gt;firmware&lt;/a&gt; broadcast a fixed public key and, therefore, are trackable by other devices in proximity (this might change in a future release). OpenHaystack is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GB48S3"&gt;A high-level understanding of how the security model for Find My works also helps understand why OpenHaystack is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToMNk7"&gt;Find My works by using a combination of public and private keys. Any Apple user can access the public keys for devices in the Find My network, but you need the private key in order to actually access location information. This means not even Apple can access your location information without your private keys. The network is possible because Apple devices communally track the public keys, but only users can get location data from private keys.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How OpenHaystack gets on the FindMy network" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbLNvcqV7Wz51mhNC1yaLl405Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345345/FindMyOverview.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OpenHaystack&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How OpenHaystack gets on the Find My network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n70MOz"&gt;What OpenHaystack does is create one of those public / private key pairs for your own Bluetooth tag and uses Apple Mail to register it in the Find My network. To Apple, it just looks like another iPhone. The Mac app then accesses the public key database, pairs it with the private key you created, and bam: secure location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byvR9j"&gt;From the way it’s designed, it seems like it might be difficult for Apple to cut off OpenHaystack easily without also cutting off a bunch of older Apple devices. However, it’s also surely true that Apple as a company won’t like the whole thing and may try to find a way to block it. A developer could use the system to create a way to add Android devices to the Find My network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnABVp"&gt;The team behind OpenHaystack has written a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02282"&gt;paper detailing its methods&lt;/a&gt; and disclosing a now-fixed security flaw. It also released the &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware"&gt;source code for its firmware&lt;/a&gt;, which other developers could use to adapt OpenHaystack to other BLE devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhvZGZ"&gt;Apple’s &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; support for third-party accessories is still coming. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-AUC002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22313461%2Fopenhaystack-apple-find-my-network-diy-airtags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin has already announced a set of earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that will support Find My. Given how complex the setup of OpenHaystack is, it probably won’t gain mass adoption. It’s similar in some ways to AirMessage and Beeper, two tools that use Mac utilities to redirect iMessages to Android devices. Apple’s ecosystem is locked down in any number of ways, but the Mac finds a way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yVZ3Xw"&gt;Microsoft’s first-generation Surface Headphones released in 2018, and despite being three years old, these headphones are still a good option if you’re looking for a pair of noise-canceling headphones. Usually $250, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsrRoundup030421/https://computers.woot.com/offers/microsoft-surface-headphones-7?" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot currently has a deal on this model&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $111.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="EOkhNa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Pro with the M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best-performing laptops within its retail price point. You can grab the late-2020 Apple laptop, which comes with 256GB of SSD storage, for $1,200 ($99 off) right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604809-REG%2Fapple_myd82ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html#donotlink"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="O2zP8g"&gt;Apple’s latest flagship wearable, the Apple Watch Series 6, was released last year. This Watch includes more sensors than previous iterations of the tech giant’s wearable lineup, including a sensor that allows you to detect your blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmIekh"&gt;You can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5MK16F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm size with GPS in space gray at Amazon for $380&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price for this configuration to date. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Losing YouTube on the old Apple TV underscores how far ahead competitors are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vgNgIDxQvifYJQMBBbMX2HPZt3s=/0x0:1037x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905907/appletv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktv7q8"&gt;The YouTube app on older Apple TV models has officially been discontinued as of today. If you have a third-generation device (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/14/2870779/apple-tv-review-2012"&gt;the 2012-era model&lt;/a&gt; that predated the modern tvOS-based set-top boxes), you’ll only be able to stream YouTube through an iOS device using AirPlay starting today, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/03/older-apple-tv-will-require-airplay-for-youtube-video-playback-starting-next-month/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbm3Xl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265965/apple-tv-3rd-gen-youtube-native-onboard-support-airplay"&gt;While the news&lt;/a&gt; has been known for a while, the change highlights a key issue with the Apple TV ecosystem. Namely, that it’s been nearly three and a half years since Apple has last updated its streaming box hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YzIXC"&gt;If you own the old model with the now defunct YouTube app, your only Apple-made options are the 2017 Apple TV 4K or what Apple now calls the Apple TV HD, the older model from 2015. That’s particularly problematic, given that the Apple TV 4K still starts at $179 (with a pricier 64GB model that offers double the storage for $199), despite being released years ago. Even the Apple TV HD still costs $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xL6HP2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best streaming device to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="131UHf"&gt;That’s in stark comparison to competitors like Amazon, Google, and Roku, which have released newer streaming products that offer the same (if not better) features than Apple’s outdated box at far lower prices. Roku’s flagship streaming box, the Roku Ultra, costs $99 — nearly half the price of the entry-level Apple TV 4K — while supporting 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Apple’s own AirPlay 2 streaming. The $50 Streaming Stick Plus offers 4K and HDR (without Dolby Vision) for those looking to save even more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzpZWk"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Cube costs $119.99 and offers similar high-end streaming specs, while also doubling as a full-fledged Echo speaker. Like Roku, Amazon also has its cheaper $50 Fire TV Stick 4K, which offers the full gamut of streaming support (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, and HDR10) without the added Alexa speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4oWWs"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s latest Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, which costs just $50, offers excellent content curation, supports 4K, HDR, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision, and remains &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s best choice for a streaming stick in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Khq9Gq"&gt;With more and more apps starting to end support for Apple’s older streaming boxes (CBS All Access has already announced that it’ll be enacting a similar change when Paramount Plus launches), the problem of the Apple TV’s outdated hardware and pricing are only going to continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPkleZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article previously stated that Apple’s only remaining TV hardware was the Apple TV 4K. It has been updated to reflect that Apple still sells the older Apple TV HD. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple now lets you automatically transfer your iCloud Photo Library to Google Photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-O7yIeZOplUwpIsFuP79ABD7WEs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905811/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B6Vb1x"&gt;Apple has added a service that lets you automatically transfer photos, videos, and albums from your iCloud Photo Library to Google Photos (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/apple-transfer-icloud-photos-google-photos/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The feature has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208514"&gt;a support document outlining the procedure&lt;/a&gt;, which simply entails going to &lt;a href="https://privacy.apple.com/"&gt;privacy.apple.com&lt;/a&gt;, logging in, and going through the “transfer a copy of your data” process. Apple says the transfer will take between three days to a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlPxfA"&gt;Some things won’t transfer: Apple says shared albums, smart albums, photo stream content, live photos, some metadata, and media that isn’t stored in your iCloud Photo Library won’t come along for the ride. The part about Live Photos is especially eyebrow-raising. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207310"&gt;iPhones take Live Photos by default&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple doesn’t make it clear if the entire picture will be left behind, or just the video clip surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mk15DTxUNHvZ7V2VrURoGN8T2rg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343247/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_12.23.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MKDR7D"&gt;For what it’s worth, the transfer tool tells me 10,793 of my photos will be transferred, which is the exact number of pictures in my library. Given that over 2,500 of those are Live, it would seem Apple is planning on transferring them, but we did reach out to clarify. At the time of writing, we haven't heard back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOq2XL"&gt;Apple says the feature won’t remove anything from your iCloud Photo Library; it will simply make a copy of it, so you’ll still need to manually delete things if you no longer want them stored in iCloud. Additionally, the feature is currently only available to people in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHmI7k"&gt;If you’re looking to make the jump from iPhone to Android or just want to use Google Photos, this tool should provide an easy way to quickly transfer all of your photos to the service without having to reupload them yourself. A few clicks, and your photos will be on their way to their new home. Just make sure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;you have enough Google storage space&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arizona advances bill forcing Apple and Google to allow Fortnite-style alternative payment options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TWEgfW8HMIiY9WkmROupVEYvJps=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905040/bfarsace_201106_4269_001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4YCz23"&gt;The Arizona House of Representatives just passed landmark app store legislation in a 31-29 vote on Wednesday that could have far-reaching consequences for Apple and Google and their respective mobile operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwGZtT"&gt;The legislation, a &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;sweeping amendment to Arizona’s existing HB2005&lt;/a&gt;, prevents app store operators from forcing a developer based in the state to use a preferred payment system, putting up a significant roadblock to Apple and Google’s ability to collect commissions on in-app purchases and app sales. It will now head to the state senate, where it must pass before its sent to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDD94Y"&gt;The amendment specifically prohibits stores exceeding 1 million downloads from requiring “a developer that is domiciled in this state to use a particular in-application payments system as the exclusive mode of accretive payments from a user.” It also covers users living in Arizona from having to pay for apps using exclusive payment systems, though it’s not immediately clear if that means developers outside Arizona can avoid paying commission to Apple and Google when they sell something to a state resident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPkq8S"&gt;The bill specifically exempts game consoles “and other special-purpose devices that are connected to the internet,” and it also bars companies like Apple and Google from retaliating against developers who choose to use third-party payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yZst2P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bill opens the door to alternative payment systems on iOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo2fXl"&gt;The amendment narrowly passed the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week in a 7-6 vote, which sent it to the floor of the state’s House of Representatives for a full vote on Wednesday. Notable opponents of the bill have been Arizona Democrats, who’ve argued that state legislatures shouldn’t get involved in ongoing legal matters between companies, in reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; between Apple and Google and companies like &lt;em&gt;Forntite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games. There was also concern the bill would interfere with interstate commerce and raise unconstitutionality claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQuEBI"&gt;The bill opens the door to developers using third-party payment systems, thereby allowing them to bypass the industry standard 30 percent cut Apple and Google have collected for years. It’s not clear how the tech companies will respond, as the bill could have significant effects on their businesses in the state of Arizona while also putting pressure on them to change the rules for all developers everywhere. Both Apple and Google declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6jqkl"&gt;“Today, Arizona put a marker down and became the first state in the nation to advance a digital market that is free and fair,” said the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), the industry group composed of Epic, Tinder parent company company Match Group, and Spotify that is responsible for helping draft the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySd8Ae"&gt;“The Coalition for App Fairness is pleased to see the House passage of HB 2005, which will encourage business innovation in Arizona and protect consumer choice. While this is cause for celebration, it is only a first step toward achieving a truly level playing field for all,” the statement goes on to say. “We look forward to working with the Arizona State Senate to move a solution forward that builds on this momentum to provide consumer freedom, lower costs, and increase developers’ ability to thrive and innovate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oco2KR"&gt;The bill has attracted intense lobbying from Apple and Google. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;published earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, Apple tapped lobbyist Rod Diridon and also hired Kirk Adams, the former chief of staff to Arizona’s governor, to help make its case to the House of Representatives. Apple also joined the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and pushed the body to begin combating the bill, &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;reported. “We went through a very difficult weekend where Apple and Google hired probably almost every lobbyist in town,” Arizona State Rep. Regina Cobb, a Republican and the primary sponsor of the bill, told&lt;em&gt; Protocol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULD3Hv"&gt;In testimony in front of the House, Apple’s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, made the case that the App Store provides value to developers that warrant its commission. “The commission has been described by some special interests as a ‘payment processing fee’—as if Apple is just swiping a credit card. That’s terribly misleading. Apple provides developers an enormous amount of value — both the store to distribute their apps around the world and the studio to create them. That is what the commission reflects,” Andeer said in written testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sd59ZZ"&gt;“Yet this bill tells Apple that it cannot use its own check-out lane (and collect a commission) in the store we built,” he goes on. “This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free — even if they’re selling digital goods, even if they’re making millions or even billions of dollars doing it. The bill is a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcWRtn"&gt;“Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone. Because of that, for any app that offers digital services like games or music, you have to pay through Apple or Google’s monopolistic payment processing system,” Cobb wrote in an &lt;a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/02/19/its-time-to-free-ourselves-from-big-tech-monopoly/"&gt;op-ed for the &lt;em&gt;Arizona Capitol Times&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “You have to use their system and their payment processor, and then they tax you for it. Small app developers have to absorb the cost and struggle to survive or pass the tax onto their consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4X4AfZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kxcyR5"&gt;The sentiment is one shared by vocal critics of Apple and Google, like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. He has submitted testimony for two bills — this one in Arizona and another in North Dakota — in support of legislation to break up what he sees as monopolies on software distribution, and he’s waged an impassioned campaign against Apple in particular since last summer, when the iPhone maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;engaged in a dispute with Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; over its new Hey email application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XrU4T"&gt;“Apple operates a tollbooth on the only road to distribution of mobile software for the dominant iPhone platform. And this doesn’t just hurt app developers, but consumers as well. When Apple tried to shake down our company for the 30% cut of revenues, they explicitly encouraged us simply to pass on the cost to consumers. And that’s exactly what other developers have done,” Hansson wrote in testimony to the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week. He added that the bill “would not only provide immediate relief to Arizona developers and consumers, it would instantly make the state the most desirable place on earth to start a new software company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvANiS"&gt;The bill is one of many — including ones in Georgia, Hawaii, and Minnesota, as well as one that already failed in the North Dakota state senate — making their way through local legislatures. The multistate push can be drawn back to a national lobbying effort from the CAF. The industry group consists of not only Epic, Match, and Spotify, but also dozens of other companies dissatisfied with the rules imposed by Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. Epic is also engaged in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against both Apple and Google over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last summer, a dispute that sits at the heart of the ongoing app store debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3CIISd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bills are part of a multistate lobbying effort from the Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBPaKu"&gt;The CAF, which worked alongside Match to approach Cobb for HB2005, has been hiring lobbyists around the country to approach representatives with draft bills that would make it easier for developers to bypass rules thought to be ironclad within the mobile app world. Specifically for Apple, these bills are targeting rules dictating that iOS users and the platform’s developers only buy, sell, and distribute software through the App Store. (Google allows alternative app stores on Android, though it does present security warnings and other obstacles to users who download and use them.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNk0wf"&gt;Additionally, these bills are taking aim at rules saying app makers must use the preferred payment systems of Apple and Google, as a backup defense in the event alternative app stores remain off the table. It’s those terms, written into developer agreements the companies make app makers sign to distribute software through the stores, that allow both companies to take anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of all revenue generated from digital goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir14ht"&gt;The Arizona bill follows a similar, though broader and potentially more disruptive bill in North Dakota that last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failed to pass the state’s senate&lt;/a&gt;. The North Dakota bill would have forced Apple and Google to allow alternative app stores onto iOS and Android, in addition to allowing developers to use alternative payment systems. The North Dakota bill, which failed in an 11-36 vote, would have also barred companies from retaliating against developers that opted to use alternative app stores or payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj1Erq"&gt;Apple similarly lobbied hard against the North Dakota bill, with Apple’s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, testifying that the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it.” He further argued that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdVDxR"&gt;Central to all of these bills and the fierce lobbying efforts surrounding them from both sides is a debate threatening one of the most lucrative pillars of Apple’s (and to a lesser extent Google’s) business: Should app store owners be able to set the rules for what kind of software is allowed onto mobile phones, and should those rules also force developers into paying commissions for accessing the platform? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBdiGX"&gt;Just a few years ago, that Apple and other companies would take 30 percent of all revenue was considered a settled matter. While some companies, like Netflix and Spotify, complained vigorously about unfair treatment, Apple’s iron grip on the App Store, and by extension the iPhone, felt inexorable. It was simply how mobile app distribution worked — unless you were a large company like Amazon, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;cut special deals with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="w8Xx9F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WCuqfA"&gt;But growing resentment from developers large and small, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301453/antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-reform-cicilline-buck"&gt;an upswell in regulatory fervor in Washington&lt;/a&gt;, and growing consumer hostility toward Big Tech have created an unprecedented movement hoping to rein in Silicon Valley’s most powerful corporations. Square in the sights of all these parties is the App Store — specifically the 30 percent cut, or “Apple tax” as it has come to be known, and the payment system requirements that help enforce it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUSoVB"&gt;Apple has already made some concessions in its relationship to developers in response to rising antitrust pressure. Most prominently, the company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;new small business program late last year&lt;/a&gt; allowing developers making less than $1 million in annual revenue to lower the App Store cut they pay to Apple from 30 percent to 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLbUvg"&gt;But those concessions are far from stopping Apple’s critics, nor the lobbying efforts of its most committed opponents, from pushing for more. “Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them, and soon that might well be most of the economy,” Hansson wrote in the conclusion of his HB2005 testimony. “Giving us at least a fighting chance by enforcing a choice in payment processing is the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6B1z3"&gt;Following the bill’s passing, Hansson said his company Basecamp was fully prepared to relocate to Arizona to take advantage of the perks. “This means everything,” he wrote on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wljdkv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are going to prepare app updates for both Android and iOS that give Arizonans the right to signup for service using our normal payment processing setup. Then start the conversation with lawyers on what it’ll take to relocate Basecamp to Arizona. This means everything.&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1367197326041903106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
