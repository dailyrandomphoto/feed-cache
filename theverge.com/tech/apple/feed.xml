    <title>Apple will now require employees to submit proof of COVID-19 booster shot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store cube stock 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nbql_Y8lQk52pmKhPsCxgYqN-xw=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70394216/theverge3_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0bPp0"&gt;Apple now requires store and corporate employees to get a COVID-19 booster shot, the company announced in an internal email seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8JQJu"&gt;Once an employee is eligible to get a booster shot, they will have four weeks to comply, otherwise, they will need to take frequent tests to enter a retail store, partner store, or Apple office starting on February 15th. Apple will require unvaccinated employees — or those who haven’t yet submitted proof of vaccination — to provide negative COVID-19 rapid antigen tests before entering the workplace beginning on January 24th, although it’s unclear whether this applies to both corporate and retail employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8RVbxv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple boosts safety protocols as the omicron variant spreads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mILrja"&gt;“Due to waning efficacy of the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines and the emergence of highly transmissible variants such as Omicron, a booster shot is now part of staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccination to protect against severe disease,” Apple states in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgxOlg"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;Apple asked that unvaccinated corporate employees take daily tests&lt;/a&gt; before entering the office, with unvaccinated retail workers testing twice per week. The company also began requiring vaccinated individuals to take COVID-19 tests once every week, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679772/apple-vaccine-policy-covid-19-testing-unvaccinated"&gt;lowered the frequency of these tests&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that Apple’s “infrequent” testing policy no longer applies to employees who don’t receive the booster shot by Apple’s deadline, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sp61V"&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877332/meta-facebook-require-employees-covid-19-booster-vaccine-shot-return-office-reopening"&gt;Meta said employees will need to get a COVID-19 booster shot&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the company’s return to in-office work in March. While Google hasn’t mandated company-wide booster shots yet, it requires employees to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work"&gt;have the first two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884539/google-require-negative-molecular-test-covid-19-offices"&gt;take weekly molecular tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will let dating apps offer third-party payment options in the Netherlands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-G1OIsdNoZpjEYYJ4rTZp7cd0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393949/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oc0YNi"&gt;Apple will let dating app developers offer alternate payment options in the Netherlands in compliance with the Dutch regulator’s ruling, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-15/apple-will-add-additional-payment-options-for-dutch-dating-apps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow dating apps — and only dating apps — distributed in the country to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;Apple’s 15 to 30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; on in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSHZQL"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mbbs4zql"&gt;a message to developers on its site&lt;/a&gt;, Apple explains that it’s introducing &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/"&gt;two new optional “entitlements,”&lt;/a&gt; or specific app capabilities, that will let developers add third-party payment processors for dating apps in the Netherlands. Dating app developers can either direct customers to a website to complete their purchase or add a third-party payment service within the app. However, if developers choose to snub Apple’s payment service in favor of an alternative, Apple says it won’t be able to help users with refunds, subscription management, or any payment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rEFNMv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests, we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWesu1"&gt;Apple has appealed the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets’ (ACM) decision. “Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests, we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court,” Apple explains. “We’re concerned these changes could compromise the user experience, and create new threats to user privacy and data security. In the meantime, we are obligated to make the mandated changes which we’re launching today and we will provide further information shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K53ogY"&gt;In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852966/apple-netherlands-dating-apps-match-tinder-app-store-competition"&gt;the ACM ruled that Apple allow dating apps in the country to offer third-party payment services&lt;/a&gt;, and if the company failed to do so by January 15th, it would face a 5 million Euro-per-week fine. The &lt;a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-launches-investigation-abuse-dominance-apple-its-app-store"&gt;ACM began its investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s payment rules in 2019, concentrating specifically on dating apps following a complaint from Match Group, which owns popular online dating services Match.com, Tinder, OkCupid, and Hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHp9Z3"&gt;Apple’s payment policies have stirred up controversy across the globe, with South Korea introducing legislation that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22877952/apple-third-party-payments-app-store-south-korea"&gt;requires the company to allow in-app third-party payment services&lt;/a&gt;. Its restriction on alternate payment services is also the catalyst behind the ongoing battle between Epic Games and Apple — a court order that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;forces Apple to allow external payment options&lt;/a&gt; was just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;put on hold after an appeal from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, Apple made a small compromise and agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;let “reader” apps point customers to external sites&lt;/a&gt; for subscription signups.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s excellent Basilisk V3 mouse is selling for its best price ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Basilisk V3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93zvcK6thr59E8heEEsXStf-ij4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393670/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Basilisk V3 is on sale at Amazon today for just $59.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sEIbpk"&gt;We’re starting the weekend with some exciting news for gamers: our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;pick for the best wired gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; is now available for its lowest price to date. For only the third time, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming/dp/B09C13PZX7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling Razer’s Basilisk V3 for just $59.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $69.99. The comfortable mouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;delivers notable improvements&lt;/a&gt; over its predecessor, particularly in regards to its scroll wheel. Depending upon how hard your scroll, the mouse can switch between ridged scrolling and free-spin modes, which make it easier to scroll down the page more freely — a perk that comes in handy even if you’re not using the mouse for gaming. It also touts a 26K DPI sensor, RGB lighting, and 11 programmable buttons, so you can adjust the controls to your liking within Razer’s Synapse software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wjkAwO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ChiQ"&gt;If you’re on the market for a pair of affordable true wireless earbuds, today we’re seeing some great discounts on both the new Jabra Elite 3 earbuds &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Jabra’s older Elite 75t. Already considered Jabra’s budget buds, the Elite 3 typically retail for $79.99 but are on sale today for $59.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Built/dp/B09B45T59G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVt4AzUUic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Chris Welch praised the earbuds, noting that they sound better than he expected given their price. He was also impressed by their performance, decent call quality, no-fuss controls, and lengthy battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTXNHE"&gt;However, if you’re looking for wireless earbuds that offer features like noise cancellation, the $149.99 Elite 75t are also on sale at Best Buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp0dUvFa7T" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $79.99&lt;/a&gt;, which nearly matches their best price to date. While the noise cancellation on these isn’t quite as good as it is on the newer &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/26374473.5227/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxNTQ5NTg3L2phYnJhLWVsaXRlLTg1dC1yZXZpZXctZmVhdHVyZXMtc3BlY3MtcHJpY2U/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb3df85a2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t&lt;/a&gt;, they both boast excellent sound with a good amount of bass. The Elite 75t are also comfortable and capable of connecting to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, a feature still not commonly found in many wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Elite 75t review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="pPy4Pw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XILdnP"&gt;Shifting from wireless earbuds to high-quality microphones, the $129.99 Blue Yeti mic is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in select colors for $99.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp5KfMrnfX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;; this includes the black model, which Amazon hasn’t discounted since July. While not its best price ever, this is the lowest we’ve seen the mic sell for since the holidays. A popular staple with podcasters, YouTubers, and Twitch streamers, the Yeti is capable of conforming to a number of different recording environments. It also allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio, rendering it one of the more versatile budget options out there for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lggHuR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-4643279180604848904ZHRjPs"&gt;DJI’s Mavic Mini remains one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best drones you can buy for under $500&lt;/a&gt;, however, $450 is still a lot of money. Thankfully, if you’re looking for something more affordable, its 2019 predecessor is available today at Newegg with a handful of accessories. Right now, you can buy the last-gen &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=TheVergeDailyDeals1152022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F380-0002-00345" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI Mavic Mini Fly More Combo for just $299.99&lt;/a&gt;, a solid $100 discount. The bundle includes three sets of spare propellers, a carrying bag, a propeller guard, a gimbal protector, spare batteries, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-4643279180604848904Y1gSCr"&gt;Despite the fact the Mavic Mini is an older, more budget-friendly drone, it still shares many features in common with more expensive models, like a number of creative shooting modes and the ability to automatically return to its takeoff spot. It also doesn’t require FAA registration, a boon for experienced drone pilots and newcomers alike. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938530/dji-mavic-mini-price-specs-faa-ultra-light-combo-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mEkTeZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T07o9o"&gt;Some other ways to save this weekend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AWG8HQ"&gt;If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, Amazon is selling a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online Family Membership and a SanDisk 128GB Micro SD card for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BT4MTZS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just $34.99 (nearly $40 off&lt;/a&gt;), giving you a way to game online and expand your console’s storage space at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZwVNY7"&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods are still selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at the low price of $139.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. They originally sold for $179.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h5OXiV"&gt;Lenovo’s Smart Clock 2 with a built-in wireless charging pad &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgqmnNTjMYj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $64.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, down from $89.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The best noise-canceling headphone deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8ZQ6F2601Vo7AEwFugPl0G63SE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70392555/bfarsace_190903_3639_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless 3 headphones are just $241 instead of $399.99 at Adorama.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2yBGHO"&gt;With many people working from home than they used to, owning a good pair of noise-canceling headphones has become more appealing than ever. However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4B19IV"&gt;That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a buying decision, we’ve put together a guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L17MDv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFH8rh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10961832"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4 are the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GSgzPh"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XtIOrp"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 is our overall pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. They offer excellent noise-canceling, good sound and voice quality, and the ability to pair to two devices simultaneously. You can wear these for long periods of time as well, as their plush ear pads make them comfortable to wear for as long as you need. They can even last up to 30 hours on a single charge and can be charged via USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRoMJX"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the $349.99 headphones drop to $248 — their lowest price to date. They remained around that price throughout the holiday season, but, unfortunately, many retailers have since ended their sales. Some retailers, however, are offering bundle deals that are still worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE9AC9"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?subId1=TheVergeBestNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; is bundling the WH-1000XM4 with a 20,800mAh battery pack and a microfiber cleaning cloth for $348. Mophie’s power bank typically sells for $39.95, so this bundle is valued at around $390. If you don’t care for the battery pack or prefer to shop elsewhere, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863FR3S9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1582549-REG%2Fsony_wh1000xm4_b_wh_1000xm4_wireless_noise_canceling_over_ear.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the headphones for $348. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max is a good pick for those deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Yu5lCJ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UfClp3"&gt;If you’re looking for the best sound quality you can get in a pair of noise-canceling headphones, we recommend the AirPods Max. The headphones pair seamlessly with other Apple devices and sound superb, especially combined with Apple’s surround sound-like Spatial Audio feature, which allows for a more immersive experience when listening to or watching select content. They also tout the best transparency mode of all the headphones on our list while boasting incredible build quality thanks to a luxe design that takes opts for aluminum, steel, and fabric over plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqkx5j"&gt;At $549, these headphones are expensive, but we’ve been seeing a lot of discounts lately. Right now, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the AirPods Max for $479&lt;/a&gt;, which is about $50 shy of their best price to date and their standard sale price. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3FNtt%3Dairpods%2520max%26N%3D0%26InitialSearch%3Dyes%26sts%3Dma&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; is offering the same discount but only on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610234-REG%2Fapple_mgyj3am_a_airpods_max_silver.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610237-REG%2Fapple_mgym3am_a_airpods_max_pink.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt; models.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation Sennheiser Momentum Wireless headphones sound great and integrate with Tile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CZefdO"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j2k0rf"&gt;If you’re a non-Apple user looking for a pair of noise-canceling headphones that sound fantastic, Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless 3 is your best option. We found that they boast detailed, bass-rich sound, a stylish, retro-inspired design, and are extremely comfortable to wear — even when you’re donning glasses. Although their noise cancellation might not rival other models on our list, they make up for it with convenient software features like ambient passthrough and a customizable EQ. Plus, unlike many other headphones, they integrate with the location tracking device, Tile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TshVIF"&gt;The headphones typically retail for $399.99, but several retailers have been selling them for $241 since Black Friday. Right now, however, only &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107512/1036?subId1=TheVergeNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fse508234.html"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; has them for $241 (and only in black). That’s nearly half their usual price, saving you $159. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2 are great for multitasking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1HLSET"&gt;Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wB7ybM"&gt;Multitaskers will appreciate Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2 as they offer terrific, reliable multipoint Bluetooth support. You can seamlessly pair them with multiple devices, allowing you to juggle content and switch back and forth at the same time. These headphones also offer intuitive dial controls for volume and noise cancellation, with far better quality and battery life than their predecessor. While the noise canceling isn’t quite as effective as Bose’s and Sony’s, they still adequately silence outside noises so you can focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slxuWB"&gt;During Black Friday, Microsoft’s $249.99 Surface Headphones 2 dropped down to $162.49, which is almost half their typical retail price. We’re not currently seeing any similar big deals on them, but you can still a pair for $230.99 from &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-headphones-2%2F8WQ0BSX7G523%2FCS2R%3FOCID%3D%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/619711/9383?subId1=TheVergeNCHeadphones142022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Headphones-2-Black-Wireless%2F226974951&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEW-Microsoft-Surface-Headphones-Matte/dp/B086QCFRQ5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt; Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700 boast excellent voice quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7hB20N"&gt;Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl2BaG"&gt;If you plan to frequently use your headphones for voice calls, Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are the best option on this list for doing so. They boast excellent voice call quality, meaning everybody on your Zoom call will be able to hear you loud and clearly, and they offer great noise cancellation with satisfactory sound. Like the QC45, the over-ears can also connect to two devices simultaneously, but they can’t be folded and only offer 20 hours of battery life, which is also less than other headphones on this list provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FueOFu"&gt;We’ve seen several discounts on the 700s over the past year or so, with the best reaching an all-time low of $299. Lately, however, we haven’t seen any sales that steep. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X5F81JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has been selling them for $379&lt;/a&gt; instead of $399 for the past six months, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-11556694?sid=TheVergeNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fheadphones%2Fnoise_cancelling_headphones%2Fnoise-cancelling-headphones-700.html%23v%3Dnoise_cancelling_headphones_700_black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoJJjLU8c0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are currently selling the headphones for the same price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Studio 3 are nearly half off and thus a good alternative if you’re looking for a more budget-friendly pair of headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eO1gZ8"&gt;Beats Studio 3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4X0vv8"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we couldn’t recommend&lt;/a&gt; these to anybody outside of the Apple ecosystem, the Beats Studio 3 Wireless could be a decent alternative if you want a pair of over-ear headphones from Apple but find the AirPods Max to be too expensive. The Beats Studio 3 are comfortable to wear, fold inward for easy stowing, and feature Apple’s last-gen W1 wireless chip, which allows you to quickly connect and switch between Apple devices. Note, however, unlike those built with Apple’s newer H1 chip, the headphones lack hands-free Siri support. They also charge via a Micro USB port instead of a Lightning port or USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJn2Mp"&gt;They’re certainly showing their age at this point — they launched 2017, after all — but they're currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio3-Wireless-Headphones-Collection/dp/B08528ZCNX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale starting at $199 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in select colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Like newer Bose models, the QuietComfort 35 II are both comfortable and lightweight. They also come with a number of praiseworthy features, including good sound quality and the ability to seamlessly switch between two paired devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lint85"&gt;While their sticker price is $349, the QC35 II are frequently on sale for far less. In fact, until just recently, we saw them for as low as $179. Right now, however, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1227753/2092?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals122021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is only selling the headphones for around $299, about $30 less than Bose QC45 are currently selling for.&lt;/p&gt;

While its sticker price was $299.95, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp7ZJWzFZK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling them in blue and red for $199.99&lt;/a&gt;.

As a result, Apple no longer sells them, and the retailers that do — like Best Buy — are not likely to continue stocking them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P1QRr9"&gt;Rumors have swirled for years about Apple releasing some kind of virtual reality / augmented reality headset. While reports had pegged a possible 2022 release for the company’s first mixed reality headset, the device is hitting some development snags and may not release until 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/apple-s-hotly-anticipated-headset-risks-being-delayed-until-2023?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHJRsu"&gt;Apple planned to reveal the headset at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference, but “development challenges related to overheating, cameras and software have made it harder to stay on track,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. The issues mean the reveal may happen at the end of the year — or even later — with the headset going on sale in 2023. And Apple had apparently, at one point, planned to reveal the device even earlier; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports the company wanted to announce it in 2021 and ship it in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vb9Lo"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRU5Pg"&gt;This first headset is expected to be high end, with Apple considering prices above $2,000. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says it will have two processors, and at least one will be “on par” with the new M1 Pro chip that’s available with the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;refreshed MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/26/22802981/apple-ar-headset-m1-processor-release-date-specs"&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; that the device will have two chips with one being M1-adjacent. Previous reports have also said that the headset will have two 4K OLED microdisplays, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825675/apple-ar-headset-hand-tracking-controllers-kuo-report"&gt;3D sensors for hand tracking&lt;/a&gt;, among other advanced components, all of which could be contributing to the rumored high price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tpb5hc"&gt;Apple is also still working on a set of AR glasses, though they might be a long ways off. The company plans to introduce them “later this decade,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite is technically back on iOS, thanks to a GeForce Now game streaming loophole</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtyUxf0pBtgDZv_BRibCrnvuzKs=/256x0:1792x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383281/GFN_Thursday_January_13.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlWmSf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is back on iOS today... sort of. The popular battle royale game isn’t back on the App Store (where it’s been missing since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple pulled the app from its storefront&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020), but iPhone and iPad owners can now stream &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to play on their phones and tablets through Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, which opened up a closed beta today to test the new streaming version of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2L94w"&gt;Nvidia and Epic Games have been promising that Fortnite would come back to iOS through GeForce Now running through Safari’s web browser (the only way that Apple currently allows game streaming services like GeForce Now, Stadia, xCloud, or Luna to operate on iOS) &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/11/19/geforce-now-on-ios-safari/"&gt;as far back as November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when the service first launched on Apple’s hardware. But it’s apparently taken quite a bit of time to sort out the details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PwgyeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fortnite streamed to iOS, complete with touchscreen optimized controls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YMVD3h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has technically already been available on GeForce Now for Android users, but that version of the game is a streamed copy of the desktop version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. The new version that Nvidia and Epic Games are beta testing is optimized for mobile devices, with similar touchscreen controls and menus to the old native iOS and Android versions of the game. (Nvidia warns that Android users who join the beta will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be able to play the new mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and won’t be able to use a keyboard and mouse like they currently can.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1WrZP"&gt;According to Nvidia, beta sign-ups start today, with “selected members” set to get access later in January. The company says that the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;beta will be a “limited time” process but that “we do not have an exact timeline for how long it will last.” Anyone interested in trying the new streamed version of Fortnite can sign up at Nvidia’s website, with both free and paid GeForce Now customers getting an “equal chance at the closed beta.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KP7q7m"&gt;Nvidia is notably the only game streaming service that Epic Games is partnering with for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — as a deposition in the Apple / Epic trial revealed last year, Epic deliberately isn’t allowing Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;to offer &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;as part of its xCloud service&lt;/a&gt;, due to concerns that xCloud would compete with Epic’s own PC offerings. Streaming &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through xCloud to iOS would also require that Epic pay Microsoft’s 30 percent fee for in-app purchases — similar in Epic’s eyes to the Apple fees that led to the company’s lawsuit in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vhPDK6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite isn’t on Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service because Epic won’t allow it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OjhX3i"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, on the other hand, just acts as a conduit for Epic’s existing storefront, meaning that Epic Games won’t have to hand over a cent of any of the in-game purchases players make on the new streamed version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through GeForce Now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pv6m2h"&gt;Epic and Nvidia aren’t saying how long the beta will last or when to expect the GeForce Now-streamed version of Fortnite to be broadly available for all Android and iOS users. And while game streaming has improved in leaps and bounds in recent years, it’s hard to imagine that the streamed version will be a better long-term solution than the native Fortnite app that used to be on the App Store. Still, for Fortnite fans looking to get a quick round in on the go, the GeForce Now option will probably be better than nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dropbox finally supports M1 Macs natively with new beta  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xv4a7Da6mIzYtDnjwZyi7U2b_F0=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382333/dropbox_logo_2x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dropbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jy6cmn"&gt;Dropbox’s latest beta has added native support for Macs with M1 processors, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/dropbox-releases-long-awaited-macos-version-with-native-m1-support-in-beta/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The addition was confirmed by a Dropbox community manager on the &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Apple-Silicon-M1-Desktop-Sync-Compatibility/td-p/527743"&gt;company’s forums&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve verified it by installing the latest beta of the macOS app. You can grab it yourselves from &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-desktop-client-builds/Beta-Build-140-3-1903/td-p/570154"&gt;this Dropbox forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59drqh"&gt;The service has always worked on Apple’s M1 Macs, but until now it’s had to use Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer. This allowed the macOS app, which was originally designed for old Intel-based Macs, to run on machines with Apple’s new M1 processors. Offering native M1 support should result in Dropbox having better performance and consuming less power when used with Apple Silicon devices. That said, Rosetta translation is so fast you might not notice a difference in day-to-day use (we haven’t so far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BESiec"&gt;Dropbox was one of the last high-profile holdouts still lacking support for Apple’s ARM-based processors. In October there was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751178/dropbox-native-apple-silicon-app-m1-2022"&gt;some controversy&lt;/a&gt; after forum posts from the company’s employees suggested more customers would have to ask for a native M1 version before the company would develop it. The outcry that followed prompted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/1453762478479843332"&gt;Dropbox’s CEO to publicly announce&lt;/a&gt; that an M1-optimized version of the company’s macOS app would arrive in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeGG0L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlzIUo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pr32We"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and T-Mobile say iOS 15.2 didn’t switch off iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5mAZc705qkg0L06yKrgETfWWVw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381863/vpavic_210916_4760_0323.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qF06W"&gt;Apple has denied that last month’s iOS 15.2 update is behind the difficulty some iPhone owners have faced with using the iCloud Private Relay feature on cellular networks. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile earlier this week said they weren’t blocking the VPN-like feature, but T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have identified that iOS 15.2 toggled it off by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F54OgM"&gt;Now Apple says that’s not the case. After releasing an updated beta of iOS 15.3 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880835/apple-clarify-icloud-private-relay-error-messages-ios-15-3-cell-carriers"&gt;clarifies the language&lt;/a&gt; in iCloud settings, Apple &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/apple-reaffirms-icloud-private-relay-availability-refutes-t-mobiles-accusation-of-a-bug-ios-15-2/"&gt;issued a statement to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; saying that iOS 15.2 wasn’t the problem. “No changes were made to iCloud Private Relay in iOS 15.2 that would have toggled the feature off,” the statement reads. “Users are encouraged to check their Settings to see if Private Relay is enabled on their device or for a specific network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Lq8Yr2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jm2UUZ"&gt;T-Mobile has also followed up with &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; to say that that iOS 15.2 didn’t toggle the feature off after all. “Apple doesn’t change customers’ settings when they update to iOS 15.2,” the carrier says in a statement. “Customers may see an error message if they previously toggled iCloud Private Relay or Limit IP Address Tracking off in their Cellular Data Options Settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cTiEY"&gt;It’s still not entirely clear what caused all of this confusion, but the carriers do say they’re not blocking iCloud Private Relay (except for some T-Mobile plans that include content filtering services), so it’s worth double-checking your cellular settings to make sure everything’s the way it should be. Once the public version of iOS 15.3 is out, the language in settings won’t outright tell you that your cell plan doesn’t support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alleged Apple App Store scammer AmpMe lowers prices and says it’ll investigate its ‘consultants’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6MVzgbMo5nkWbSiV6DRM2wf2HY=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381697/ampme-0616.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nTluDF"&gt;AmpMe &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;a brand-new app that popped up just to scam unsuspecting users out of their money. See the photo atop this post? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/24/9391461/ampme-music-streaming-app-syncing"&gt;That’s from 2015&lt;/a&gt;, when we first covered the idea: an app that can sync up a room full of smartphones into a single gigantic speaker with no fees in sight. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626605370142724"&gt;as App Store scam hunter Kosta Eleftheriou points out&lt;/a&gt;, the app looks&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;seriously shady more than six years later — if you downloaded it yesterday, it would immediately try to sell you on a $9.99 a week automatic recurring subscription. That’s $520 a year, an incredible sum if you pull it out as a party trick and then forget to cancel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ82b8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626647300669440"&gt;AppFigures estimates&lt;/a&gt; the app has raked in $13 million since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MDwU9J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;3. Buy lots of fake reviews on a daily basis (notice the pattern of all these non-sensical reviewer “names”): &lt;a href="https://t.co/VtabR80QkP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VtabR80QkP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626639067238403?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s775Xb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;As we discussed last April&lt;/a&gt;, it’s ridiculously easy to find scams on Apple’s App Store — just follow the money and look at the reviews.  If you see an app that charges ridiculous subscription fees, yet still has loads of five-star ratings, something might be off. And if those reviews look absolutely fake, and the app’s barely functional, you’ve probably spotted a scam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvGrI4"&gt;What’s less easy to find: a company accused of scamming willing to stand up for itself.  Most are completely silent, but when we reached AmpMe for comment, we got a reply from its support email address. Here it is in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="50KOyM"&gt;Hi Sean,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lfWoj"&gt;The free version of our app is the most popular version and the vast majority of our users never paid a dime. Given its reception and popularity, AmpMe is a valued app and works as advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axaFLr"&gt;To claim that our users are commonly paying $520 per year does not reflect reality. For example, in 2021, the average user that subscribed and took advantage of our free trial paid a total average of $17. If you take only paying users, the average yearly subscription revenue is about $75. Internally, this has reinforced our belief that AmpMe’s pricing is transparent with clear and easy opt-out procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUPeNZ"&gt;Regarding the reviews, we hear the feedback loud and clear. Through the years, like most startups, we’ve hired outside consultants to help us with marketing and app store optimization. More oversight is needed and that’s what we are currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0M21Dp"&gt;We always adhere to Apple’s subscription guidelines and are continually working to ensure their high standards are met. We also respect and value the community’s feedback. Therefore, a new version of the app with a lower price has already been submitted to the App Store for review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWsjEi"&gt;The AmpMe Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImeJCu"&gt;We can’t confirm AmpMe’s numbers, but we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt. There are at least three other interesting takeaways in that reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8M9j9x"&gt;AmpMe isn’t denying that it hired someone to pump its brand in the App Store. Nor is it pledging not to do that in future. It’s simply pointing the blame somewhere else. Maybe it’s angry its consultants faked these reviews. Maybe it’s just annoyed they got caught.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S30gXi"&gt;AmpMe is lowering its price as a result of this scrutiny. In fact, the company’s update has already been approved and is live on the store. It’s $4.99 a week now, or $260 a year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NaPwWS"&gt;AmpMe isn’t dropping its subscription tactics, which the company believes is “transparent with clear and easy opt-out procedures”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="x461FP"&gt;I downloaded a copy of AmpMe, and I have to admit it’s not quite as blatant as I expected having heard the news. While it absolutely does hit you with a subscription request the moment you open the app, tempts you into a three-day free subscription, and the little “X” to bypass that screen is hard to spot, the app does at least clearly say how much it’s going to charge in big white letters right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmX39v"&gt;And if you do hit the “X” and skip the subscription, the app seems functional — if only as a way to watch music videos from YouTube while you chat with randos or friends, as the sync-multiple-phones-as-speakers functionality is locked behind AmpMe’s paywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sOpOoB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Profiting off forgetfulness is common now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nK6Y0"&gt;So the fact that Apple isn’t pulling this one from the App Store (and instead appears to be helping AmpMe clean up the more obvious fake reviews, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/music-app-ampme-lowers-pricing-after-accused-of-being-an-app-store-scammer/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) doesn’t really surprise me. It’s not one of the worst offenders, and the state of the tech industry is that many, many companies profit from the “whoops, forgot to cancel my subscription” phenomenon, including Apple itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfcrqX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;But as I suggested in September&lt;/a&gt;, the most valuable and profitable company in the world, the one that sells privacy as its brand and claims to put customers first, could do a heck of a lot more to show it. It could lead here instead of following. It could stop profiting from people’s forgetfulness, provide automatic refunds when people have been scammed, stop auto-renewing subscriptions by default, and kill off the star rating system that allows review fakes to flourish. Last October, it took one of those suggestions and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;brought back a way to actually report App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;. We have more.&lt;/p&gt;

It isn’t the first company Eleftheriou has uncovered where a seemingly legitimate app that’s been around for years sprouts a new set of fake reviews, and a new screen advertising an exorbitant subscription price that you have to pay or dismiss the first time you launch. (Many of these screens even look largely the same.) I wouldn’t be surprised if there are companies going around shopping this exact service to old apps, in exchange for a cut of the revenue. (&lt;a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/wajam-adware/"&gt;It seems like it may not be the first time&lt;/a&gt; AmpMe’s CEO cashed in on an old app, either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1V7JC"&gt;If you’ve been approached by such a company, or work for such a company, I’d love to talk to you. I’m at sean@theverge.com. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will clarify iCloud Private Relay error messages in iOS 15.3 to not blame cell carriers as much</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CoeElR"&gt;Apple is updating the wording for iCloud Private Relay issues in the latest iOS 15.3 beta, clarifying that problems with the service may be an inadvertently switched-off setting and not issues with a customer’s specific cell carrier, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/icloud-private-relay-clarification-ios-15-3/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUZct6"&gt;The old message put the blame for iCloud Private Relay not working squarely on the shoulders of cell carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ULsaTL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan&lt;/strong&gt;. Your cellular plan doesn’t support ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay. With ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cQVN1J"&gt;Unsurprisingly, that wording &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;led to confusion earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; when customers couldn’t get iCloud Private Relay to work on cellular connections. The issue, at least according to T-Mobile, was actually on Apple’s end: it seems that the company’s recent iOS 15.2 update toggled off Private Relay for cellular data by accident, not that T-Mobile, AT&amp;amp;T, and Verizon had suddenly disabled the feature from working on their networks. The new wording makes things a little clearer that the issue might be an accidentally toggled setting elsewhere in iOS and not a cell company problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZAeNGD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan&lt;/strong&gt;. Private Relay is either not supported by your cellular plan or has been turned off in Cellular Settings. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImUhRW"&gt;Apple has also updated its &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614"&gt;iCloud Private Relay support document&lt;/a&gt; today to make it clearer that customers might not be able to use the feature if they’ve turned off the “Limit IP Address Tracking” toggle for specific Wi-Fi or cellular networks, along with how to fix that problem on their devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fh2k9M"&gt;Hopefully, the new support document, clarified language from Apple, and the confirmations from all three major US carriers will be enough to put this week’s iCloud Private Relay confusion behind everyone. Given that the service is still technically in beta, though, it’s probably a good thing that Apple is sorting out the bugs now before it turns the service on by default. &lt;/p&gt;
