    <title>Ladies and gentlemen, a leather case for your MagSafe puck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ILxqlDEUnwChx43BVOb6jJg7F0=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69551329/856500010205_Lifestyle_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if MagSafe, but covered in leather?&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldz8wB"&gt;I’m not going to pretend to understand how product development meetings work, but there must have been something pretty special in the water when Nomad’s crack team of accessory specialists put together its latest pitch. From the company that was brave enough to encase your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111850/nomad-leather-airpods-pro-case-rugged-design-apple-accessory"&gt;AirPods Pro case in leather&lt;/a&gt;, comes an all-new leather MagSafe case. That’s right, it’s a leather case for the iPhone 12’s magnetic charging puck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbQHjj"&gt;Nomad’s argument is that the case, which is available in either black or brown, gives a MagSafe charger “a classic, yet bold new look,” and that it makes the charger slightly bigger and easier to grip to remove from a phone. But it also costs $25. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R5zK_6fLsV4DWMd50ob2xCvu4eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699659/856500010199_Lifestyle_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomad’s expanded leather universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FVhHnC"&gt;As a tech blogger, I consider it my duty to maintain a base level of open-mindedness about new technology. But I also reserve the right in exceptional circumstances to point out when something seems just plain silly, and encasing a charging puck in leather is one of those moments. I can get behind the idea of a leather case for anything you’re going to be carrying around in your pockets to protect it from the stresses of everyday life, but a charger? A charger that you’re almost certainly going to leave plugged in next to your bed for 99 percent of its life? &lt;em&gt;Please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbVkJJ"&gt;If you’re already a fully paid-up member of Nomad’s expanded leather universe, and you’ve already got a leather case for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176171/nomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287731/nomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111850/nomad-leather-airpods-pro-case-rugged-design-apple-accessory"&gt;your AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394331/apple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin"&gt;your AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, then sure, why not also cocoon your MagSafe charger in leather for the hell of it. Maybe try following our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357436/how-to-patina-iphone-x-leather-case-saddle-brown-processor"&gt;exhaustive guide to getting a nice patina&lt;/a&gt; on your leather accessories while you’re at it. You’ve earned it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google crowd out the competition with default apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-BajpgSWY_z9XLxnIOLTmw66pc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550154/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new study shows how Apple and Google’s preinstalled apps dominate their mobile platforms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wJfzM4"&gt;If you use an iPhone or Android phone, chances are the majority of your most-used apps were made by Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysNYXF"&gt;That’s the takeaway from a new Comscore study that ranks the popularity of preinstalled iOS and Android apps, such as Apple’s Messages, alongside apps made by other developers. The results show that the majority of apps people use on their phones in the US come preinstalled by either Apple or Google. The first-of-its-kind report was commissioned by Facebook, one of Apple’s loudest critics, and shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHrZWT"&gt;Preinstalled services dominate when it comes to basics like weather, photos, and clocks, according to the report, suggesting these categories will be difficult for other apps to compete in. Defaults don’t win out exclusively, though: Apple Maps and Music don’t appear on the iOS list at all, and Gmail makes the iOS list several entries below Apple Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c5cAMz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for favoring their own services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzYrnI"&gt;The timing, as Facebook likely intentioned, is apt: Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for how they favor their own services over competitors like Spotify. US lawmakers are currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;reviewing a new set of bills&lt;/a&gt; designed to curb the power of Big Tech, including legislation that could potentially bar Apple and Google from giving their services the upper hand against rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvTGa"&gt;The pushback stems from how Apple and Google bundle their apps and services with their mobile operating systems in ways that some of their competitors think is unfair. The criticism is harsher against Apple, given that it more tightly controls the apps that come preinstalled on the iPhone and doesn’t allow developers to circumvent its App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzrZxb"&gt;At the same time, it has been difficult to know how popular these preinstalled apps are relative to apps made by third-party developers since Apple and Google don’t disclose user numbers for their default apps. Research firms regularly track the popularity of apps that are available for download in app stores, but Comscore’s study is the first real attempt at charting how default mobile apps compete against other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TCKt1W"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/6523915"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tknLNo"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22313379"&gt;full interactive version here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9sO-_nhMbJmafmbNBALEFxq300A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702366/VRG_Data_Top20Apps_BarChart_Vert2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CDcIg6"&gt;To make the report last December, Comscore used data it regularly gathers from apps and websites alongside a survey of roughly 4,000 people asking about the default apps they used during the month of November. The results show that 75 percent of the top 20 apps on iOS in the US were made by Apple, while Google made 60 percent of the top apps on Android. The top four apps on both platforms were made by their respective parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hheye"&gt;Facebook is the only outside developer with more than one app on the iOS list and the only developer with three apps on the list for Android. Randomly, a staggering 78 million people used Apple’s Calculator app — more than the users of Gmail on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcH7KS"&gt;Facebook paid for the Comscore study to show the “impact of preinstalled apps on the competitive app ecosystem,” according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The social network’s executives have long criticized Apple’s limitations on third-party developers for hindering their ability to distribute mobile games and compete effectively with iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iJJVIt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple called the report “seriously flawed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBAsdA"&gt;Apple rejected the report’s findings. “This Facebook-financed survey from December 2020 was narrowly tailored to give the false impression that there’s little competition on the App Store,” an Apple spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In truth, third-party apps compete with Apple’s apps across every category and enjoy large scale success.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXdn9R"&gt;The spokesperson said the survey’s methodology was “seriously flawed in a number of ways” and that the results contradicted Comscore’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings#tab_mobile_apps/"&gt;April 2021 rankings&lt;/a&gt; on app usage. But those rankings didn't attempt to factor in the usage of all preinstalled apps like the Facebook-commissioned study did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVl9oD"&gt;Google did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MknSY7"&gt;Besides Comscore showing app usage in the US for a particular window of time, there are a couple of other quirks in its methodology to note: it did not include browsers such as Apple’s Safari or Google’s Chrome in the rankings or what it calls “embedded operating system features” like Siri. And results for Android weren’t gathered by specific phone manufacturers, meaning app usage isn’t broken out for Samsung phones relative to the Google Pixel, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="05S9u9"&gt;Still, the report points to the power platform owners have over what apps are used on their devices. It’s not just the app stores that serve as gatekeepers, but the phones themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS 101: how to force quit a Mac app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nm-CwgHR_wOY-d-ceXSgL4epemc=/0x34:1058x739/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547450/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_2.08.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oTrMbb"&gt;Apps on macOS are usually well-behaved, but there are times when they can stop working or freeze and slow down your entire Mac. If that happens to you (and it might happen often if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"&gt;playing with the latest Monterey betas&lt;/a&gt;), it’s time to quit the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu7SMu"&gt;The first thing to do, of course, is try to quit the app normally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="224zXf"&gt;Right-click on the app’s icon in the menu bar and select “Quit,” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="33lfCZ"&gt;Press the Command-Q keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DdcZYn"&gt;However, if the app is frozen or just won’t go away, then you need to force a quit. Again, there are a couple of ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LYQa97"&gt;Click on the Apple icon in the top-left corner and look for a choice that says “Force Quit” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lpmgTD"&gt;Press Command-Option-Esc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You may be able to find “Force Quit” in the Apple drop-down menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGxWEJCREgbEqgl5I-HhcupWLPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701867/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.51.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may be able to find “Force Quit” in the Apple drop-down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="byeFag"&gt;Either way, this will bring up the “Force Quit Applications” box, which will have a list of currently active apps. Highlight the troublesome app, and click on the “Force Quit” button. A pop-up will ask if you’re sure; click on “Force Quit” to finally quit the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Use the “Force Quite Applications” menu to shut down an erring app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yedHKjJbMVDbcF4Rv0fbv4N4JeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701870/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.51.30_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use the “Force Quite Applications” menu to shut down an erring app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XHmqw7"&gt;If for any reason you can’t access the “Force Quit” menu, there is another way to quit the app using the Activity Monitor, which lists all of the active processes on your Mac. To get to the Activity Monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rF7rhW"&gt;Use Spotlight Search to find “Activity Monitor,” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4X1teS"&gt;In your Finder, click on Applications in the left-hand menu. In the resulting list of apps, double-click on Utilities to open the folder, and then double-click on Activity Monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll find Activity Monitor in the Applications Utility folder." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvDa75zQOI0DwTY5DW0vxkRhhz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701873/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_11.56.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll find Activity Monitor in the Applications’ Utility folder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="FZwqc2"&gt;You’ll see a list of active processes, which should include your misbehaving app. It’s going to be a long list, so you can click on the “Process Name” heading to alphabetize the list for an easier find. If you suspect that the app is stressing your CPU, you might try clicking on the “% CPU” heading, which may put the app at the top of the list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you’ve found the app, click the “x” icon at the top of the list." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CMmuCURZUgQZz6vrf9_GYtYx94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701874/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_11.57.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’ve found the app, click the “x” icon at the top of the list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Nt5G6I"&gt;Highlight the app you want to quit, and click on the “x” icon at the top of the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QzaPws"&gt;Click on “Force Quit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you can either quit or force quit the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbRG3yXrKPupi5QFry73TVRQz_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701875/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_12.03.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can either quit or force quit the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kBldLk"&gt;And if you’re still having difficulties, you can always shut down your system. You may lose some of what you’re currently working on, but it will close the app that’s driving you nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="368Xap"&gt;Hold down your power button (or the Touch ID button if your Mac has a Touch Bar) until you see the Apple logo on your display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vFZxsK"&gt;Let go, and allow the system to restart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uA3HUE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avlTqC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rep. Ken Buck is the new face of Republican antitrust</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mvvADHQsCpRnBsMa6yonMWghE5Y=/0x1:2039x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69545202/lswall_210630_4654_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Meet the Republican behind the House’s bipartisan antitrust deal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XvYWU2"&gt;In Congress, pretty much everything moves at a glacial pace. But legislation targeting the market power of large tech companies is picking up an unusual amount of bipartisan momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JNGHV"&gt;After nearly two years of investigations into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, the House Judiciary Committee pushed through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;a package of six bills&lt;/a&gt; last month that would force these companies to unwind anti-competitive mergers and make the data they obtain on users more portable, in an effort to spur greater competition in the market. The package was surprising in its size and scope, but even more surprising — it was bipartisan. Colorado Rep. Ken Buck, the top Republican on the antitrust subcommittee, played a large role in building that coalition, which has put him at the leading edge of Republican tech policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjrWFV"&gt;On June 30th, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; met with Buck in his office on Capitol Hill for a brief interview in between House floor votes. We discussed last month’s markup, the congressman’s relationship with the rest of the Republican caucus, and how he’s “very lonely” up in his office where tech lobbyists purportedly refuse to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm1YJC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfSQyV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your initial reaction to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549025/big-tech-antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google-house-judiciary-jim-jordan"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last month’s markup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XMdxT"&gt;Tired, tired. Twenty-nine hours was a lot of time. I thought there were some really good ideas. And as I said from the beginning, this is a starting point and this is how the legislative process should work. We did an 18-month investigation. We drafted bills. We floated them to members. We filed them. They were available to members. In fact, I sent them to all the Republican members on the committee. And then we moved forward with a process with people who had different ideas. I thought it was a very positive process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKj3Sh"&gt;Some of the ideas were just poison pills that were designed to cause division, but most of the ideas proposed in amendments were really positive, and those bills will change again before they hit the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZG0up"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last year, you authored your “Third Way” report detailing the ways in which you disagreed with the majority’s solutions. Can you describe your evolution from authoring that report to supporting the Democrat-led measures last month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8O6ctc"&gt;The bills we presented take a scalpel to the issues that are necessary. What we’re trying to do is slow the monopolization of these four companies in the marketplace to encourage competition. We required the burden to flip on mergers which would slow down the growth of these companies, but at the same time we talk about portability and other things that would encourage competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TrtKPpBqhWqMIGjjIEuKPEW4Sy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22695909/lswall_210630_4654_0021.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SIKTpk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking back from the investigation and pushing for this effort to be bipartisan, what were those conversations with members like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q7jqc"&gt;My evolution from the very beginning was that the market will take care of this. Throughout the investigation, I saw how these companies are acting. I was very concerned and I realized we need to do something. But we don’t want to have the unintended consequence of shutting down the economy and hurting airlines and banks and all the other sectors that do have competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6BEwL"&gt;I think the bills are consistent with the Third Way report. But I also said, I’m opposed to overturning the American Express case. I pointed out some areas that I thought were bad policy in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOiyGf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We heard from Speaker Pelosi that she supports the measures and wants to move forward. But a couple days later, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said that they need more work. How long do you see this process taking and what needs to get done to prepare these bills for the floor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DfsCd"&gt;We take the ideas from the members in the markup. We work on the bills and probably after the August recess, we send the bills out to members again. And those will be managers’ amendments that will move forward with the floor vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3kDPQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the markup, we saw some California Democrats oppose the bills over privacy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ap7cCW"&gt;And the California Republicans, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umnyaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do you think privacy has a place in these bills?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCgCNO"&gt;Yes. The Section 230 censorship issues are under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The issue of privacy, I think in some areas, is in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The way to encourage privacy is to have competition in the marketplace and allow competitors like DuckDuckGo to say they won’t sell our data and you can choose to use that search engine. Or you can use Google’s search engine, and on page 23 of their user agreement, you can agree to allow them to sell your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwOwsh"&gt;The consumers will demand that privacy be taken into account, and some of them don’t care. Some of them do, but the marketplace will address these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIKOMt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It sounds like you agree that privacy is a competition issue. How do you include language in these bills to implement stronger privacy protections?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFrnbc"&gt;How do you implement that? That’s the problem. You don’t want government coming in and saying this kind of speech is not something that you can sell. There is cybersecurity privacy, where we absolutely want to protect from Russian hackers or whoever’s out there. But there’s also the privacy an individual decides to give up. That’s an individual right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="otQ2Am"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What Big Tech wants is to run the clock”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UaDkDY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve mentioned in the past that these bills are just the first step in taking on Big Tech. Many members of your caucus seem to disagree. I listened to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) try to force Section 230 reforms into these bills. How do you plan to meet these requests from other members as you move forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzRrqC"&gt;Section 230 is another committee and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) is working on that. I think that Jim has a lot of good ideas that I will support, but they just don’t belong in these bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fvgtb"&gt;The Democrats aren’t going to pass these 230 reforms. The Republicans who are opposed to these bills want to add it to the bill so the Dems don’t vote for it. And that’s not going to happen. What Big Tech wants is to run the clock. If they can get to the end of this Congress and if Republicans are in charge who don’t like these bills, these bills will never hit the floor. This is the opportunity to get this passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="888Azg"&gt;Jim has been a hero of mine for years, and I love the guy. We disagree about an issue. I don’t go to motive at all with Jim. I just think he and I see this issue differently. He’s been very respectful of me and in different groups that we’ve talked in and I try to be as respectful as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5Cw7v2Q5MBwss7YmWyf3uDpKOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22695904/lswall_210630_4654_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NONIKO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see these moving forward in the Senate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIotLJ"&gt;The likelihood is that you get most Democrats and some Republicans to get over that 60-vote margin. I think there will be some Republican opposition in the Senate. I actually think the Senate works much better in terms of collegial communication than the House does. They’ll be working through these issues in a healthy way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnEmrz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you’re optimistic we’ll see these bills approved over the next few years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMCMSD"&gt;I’m optimistic, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cAh7b2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m very lonely”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rd5FAT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the lobbying effort been like with these big tech companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hE9Cvp"&gt;I hear secondhand what it’s like. Nobody bothers coming in and talking to me. I’m very lonely. I love interviews like this because the reality is that the Big Tech people know this is not a friendly forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0Rg3V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your take on the court throwing out the Federal Trade Commission’s complaint against Facebook last week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSwtov"&gt;It indicates that there is even greater need for the definition of market than there previously was. The judge said in the opinion that it’s easy to define what the tobacco market is. It’s harder to define what the Facebook market is. And the FTC hasn’t done that. So these bills have a definition in place that would address that very issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWM5UM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your opinion on Lina Khan? She’s already moving forward with an aggressive antitrust agenda as FTC chair, and the conservative commissioners seem to think she’s overreaching.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrZkCx"&gt;The challenge is she doesn’t have a voting record. It’s hard to identify her in any particular group, which is good and bad. I look forward to working with her. I’ve had conversations with her. I think she is supportive of what we’re trying to do here. I have stressed in conversations that it’s essential that the FTC work in a bipartisan manner to reinforce the bipartisanship that’s coming out of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj1pX7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the FTC and the Justice Department will be strong enough to take on these companies without this legislation being passed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="K6B6Ml"&gt;Updating laws that are more than 100 years old is really important. We have to amend the laws to appropriately address this issue. The lightbulb hadn’t even been invented when the Sherman Act was passed in 1888. To think that you can click on a computer screen and get something delivered the next day is completely different. The laws have to be updated in order for law enforcement to be effective. It’s a constitutional issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcYxiq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V489p8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kensington’s StudioCaddy is a home for all your Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rycBrR7aOwJrl9DuitSd79rka5U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69544950/DSCF7728_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The StudioCaddy has USB-A and USB-C charging ports on the side.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwwjSr"&gt;Following the recent release of the StudioDock, an opulent stand that turns the iPad Pro into a mini desktop computer, Kensington is expanding its Apple-focused offerings today with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-StudioCaddy-Wireless-Charging-K59090WW/dp/B094Q4XNG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$179.99 StudioCaddy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an unusual product with a simple goal: it’s meant to be the place where all your Apple devices can live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnRsii"&gt;The StudioCaddy is comprised of two halves that attach magnetically. The first half is a basic metal stand that you can slot a closed MacBook into, and there’s also a rubberized shelf out front designed to hold an iPad. The second half attaches onto the front and includes two Qi wireless chargers, one vertical for an iPhone and one horizontal with a recess that you can put an AirPods case into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OaHm9J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hu7DlM"&gt;You could, of course, use the StudioCaddy with many combinations of Windows ultrabook, Android tablet and phone, and Qi-equipped wireless earbuds. Kensington is focusing on the Apple ecosystem, though — the product’s full name is actually “StudioCaddy with Qi Wireless Charging for Apple Devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXi8ru"&gt;The StudioCaddy feels very well built, and each stand is sturdy enough not to get knocked around a desk. The wireless charging stand also has USB-C and USB-A ports for extra power, providing up to 20W over USB-C — enough to charge an iPad (but not a MacBook Pro) reasonably quickly, or even an Apple Watch if you want to complete the set. That’s useful, although the external AC adapter is a little bulkier than I’d prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcNyZH"&gt;While I’ve found many vertical Qi chargers don’t work with my iPhone 12 Mini, Kensington has included a swappable part that lifts the phone to raise its wireless charging coils to the right level. It’s also recommended for use with smaller phones like the iPhone SE or the 11 Pro, though I found various larger Android devices would also charge just fine with it in place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0k8GSB6lgerRCT9b2dvTboX7sQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22700978/DSCF7727_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The StudioCaddy is designed to hold a MacBook and iPad while wirelessly charging an iPhone and AirPods.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HVa9ll"&gt;The main idea with the StudioCaddy is that you can save a lot of desk space by storing all your Apple devices in the same place. In practice, though, I’m not sure that people would need their iPhone charger to be attached to their laptop. Until recently I almost always used my MacBook Pro in “clamshell” mode on another stand, and I put it out of the way to save space, which the StudioCaddy does well. But I’d rather have the iPhone charging in front of me at my desk so I can see notifications coming in, so the benefit of the all-in-one approach is mostly lost on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh5KY6"&gt;If your desk setup allows it, which mine does not, it could be neat to put the StudioCaddy next to your monitor with your phone facing you and your MacBook in clamshell mode. That’s quite a lot of horizontal space to give up, however. You could also just use the StudioCaddy’s two halves independently of one another, and then you’d be left with a good wireless charger and a good MacBook/iPad stand. But there are lots of other options out there for both of those use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL3UUb"&gt;You know your own desk situation better than I do, and I can recommend the StudioCaddy if you think it’d be a decent fit. It’s a well-made, versatile product that does what it sets out to do, and most people with a lot of Apple devices could probably make good use out of it. It’s not cheap, though, so you’d have to be sure it was a better option for you than replicating all the functionality with separate products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAyPeN"&gt;The StudioCaddy will be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-StudioCaddy-Wireless-Charging-K59090WW/dp/B094Q4XNG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to order&lt;/a&gt; from today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Many Saints of Newark, Foundation, Beckett, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6F3nE015CItdqc1LFXCKEa6d2c=/169x0:1338x779/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541060/michael_gandolfini.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Michael Gandolfini stars as Tony Soprano in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAFfeGRbWLQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7EQHx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; returned to its very weird and funny roots this week and introduced Mandy Patinkin as a — let’s say “unconventional” judge, and it’s as if my favorite character from &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; got a new job. I know everyone is probably maxed out on how many streaming channels they can/want to subscribe to, but &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; is reason enough to at least check out Paramount Plus. And I have no idea what’s going to happen on the next episode of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; but (mild spoiler ahead!) I can’t imagine the two characters who got pruned will stay pruned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2awLf"&gt;This week we finally get a first look at the prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos &lt;/em&gt;and a new look at the new&lt;em&gt; Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt; show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0roKoN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAFfeGRbWLQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qOwkcG"&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PySsLR"&gt;In this prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Gandolfini plays Tony Soprano, the iconic role that won his father James multiple awards. Michael is a young Tony in what &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/many-saints-of-newark-trailer-sopranos-movie-alan-taylor"&gt;director Alan Taylor&lt;/a&gt; says is the story of Dickie Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola)— father of &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;’ Christopher— the man who made Tony into who he became. We get a glimpse of Vera Farmiga as Livia, who looks like she plays the matriarch as ice cold as the late, great Nancy Marchand did. Leslie Odom Jr., Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll, and Ray Liotta also star in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and HBO Max October 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w4sDcb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPT_PNucTWE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="olT7eW"&gt;Beckett&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TVfA1V"&gt;An American tourist vacationing in Greece gets into a car accident, and when he wakes up, he’s embroiled in a conspiracy and people are shooting at him. Mr. Beckett does not appear to have the same skill set as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKaB5dvQ4g&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;Jason Bourne&lt;/a&gt;, however, which will probably make things a bit more difficult as he tries to figure out what the hell is going on and attempts to get to the US Embassy. John David Washington and Alicia Vikander star in &lt;em&gt;Beckett,&lt;/em&gt; which hits Netflix August 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pKjod3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvOAA1U0li8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ncYdoF"&gt;Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1KMEPh"&gt;The second teaser trailer for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; finally gives us a release date for this long-awaited series based on the Isaac Asimov novels. The downfall of the Galactic Empire has been predicted by Hari Seldon (Jared Harris), so it has to build a foundation to preserve mankind’s knowledge. Along with Harris, Lee Pace stars as Brother Day, and Lou Llobell as Gaal Dornick. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; premieres September 24th on Apple TV Plus, with new episodes every Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lplJZ7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXdEeRBh9Zk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KEjKlH"&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="umjdTq"&gt;We got a teaser of the Kevin Smith revival of He-Man’s adventures in June, and now we get the full trailer. It’s not a retelling of the He-Man story, but rather picks up where the original TV show concluded in 1985. Chris Wood, Mark Hamill, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lena Headley, and Mark Hamill (as Skeletor) voice characters in &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe,&lt;/em&gt; which debuts on Netflix July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uUUatE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BSSoD73TSk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fao446"&gt;Jolt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9jN8Qt"&gt;This trailer has Kate Beckinsale kicking things and beating people up but she isn’t a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKHL5PyAPzs&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonyPicturesEntertainment"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;; instead she has a rare disorder that makes her rage out if she doesn’t get regular shock treatments from Stanley Tucci. Naturally she meets a guy who doesn’t freak out at her shocking condition (sorry) and of course he gets killed and the cops think she did it so then she has to do some revenge-kicking. Bobby Cannavale, Jai Courtney, Laverne Cox, and Susan Sarandon also star in &lt;em&gt;Jolt&lt;/em&gt; which comes to Amazon Prime Video July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tykCLL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzMpki"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Researcher finds certain network names can disable Wi-Fi on iPhones</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9xZla"&gt;A security researcher has found that certain Wi-Fi networks with the percent symbol (%) in their names can disable Wi-Fi on iPhones and other iOS devices. Carl Schou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vm_call/status/1411630091038203909?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that if an iPhone comes within range of a network named %secretclub%power, the device won’t be able to use Wi-Fi or any related features, and even after resetting network settings, the bug may continue to render Wi-Fi on the device unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VB7vyX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You can permanently disable any iOS device's WiFI by hosting a public WiFi named %secretclub%power&lt;br&gt;Resetting network settings is not guaranteed to restore functionality.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/infosec?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#infosec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/0day?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#0day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Carl Schou (@vm_call) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vm_call/status/1411630091038203909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="aiJve1"&gt;A few weeks ago, Schou and his not-for-profit group, &lt;a href="https://secret.club/"&gt;Secret Club&lt;/a&gt;, which reverse-engineers software for research purposes,&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/"&gt; found that if an iPhone connected&lt;/a&gt; to a network with the SSiD name %p%s%s%s%s%n it would cause a bug in iOS’ networking stack that would disable its Wi-Fi, and system networking features like AirDrop would become unusable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NikSyL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; offered&lt;/a&gt; a possible explanation for the weird bug: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QmbFJV"&gt;the ‘%[character]’ syntax is commonly used in programming languages to format variables into an output string. In C, the ‘%n’ specifier means to save the number of characters written into the format string out to a variable passed to the string format function. The Wi-Fi subsystem probably passes the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) unsanitized to some internal library that is performing string formatting, which in turn causes an arbitrary memory write and buffer overflow. This will lead to memory corruption and the iOS watchdog will kill the process, hence effectively disabling Wi-Fi for the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="az5wDQ"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple to see if it’s working on a fix, and will update if we hear back from them. But as&lt;em&gt; 9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes, the bug can likely be avoided by not connecting to Wi-Fi networks with percent symbols in their names. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music is missing one major thing: a classic iPod to go with it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGh4pkF2WCmY3l5Jly55D9HUqUM=/0x0:5861x3907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540186/DSCF2292.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6Hwop"&gt;Earlier this year, I did something weird: I bought an iPod 5th generation, originally manufactured back in 2006. I got it mostly as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/22/17039896/ipod-diy-upgrade-battery-memory-hack"&gt;fun thing to mod&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve actually been using it on a near-daily basis. The experience has brought me to the conclusion that Apple should bring back the iPod, but updated for the modern age. It should keep the click-wheel of course, but I can’t stop thinking about how good an iPod, designed for the age of music streaming, AirPods, and high-res displays would be. I know that might sound silly, but let me explain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jic8nB"&gt;There are a few reasons why Apple should make a new iPod. For one, it would allow the company to capitalize on some nostalgia for the iPod age that seems to be coming around, based on recent iPod-themed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;web players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/28/20986886/iphone-app-ipod-classic-click-wheel-elvin-hu-developer"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/1/22260540/ipod-mod-portable-spotify-player-click-wheel-project"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgCPcV"&gt;The other, perhaps more obvious reason, is that the iPod is a music-centric device, and Apple literally has a service called Apple Music. The company is currently in love with services revenue, but many of its devices just aren’t that great at playing music. The iPhone makes it difficult to plug in many types of headphones, and Siri interrupts what you’re listening to when you’re asking it to do something simple that doesn’t really warrant an audible response (like turning on HomeKit-powered lights, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0FeZe"&gt;Most of, if not all, of Apple’s devices also can’t play the highest-end lossless files &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;that Apple Music can now deliver&lt;/a&gt; without additional hardware. This means that Apple doesn’t sell something it can point to and say “this is the best Apple Music experience you can get, period.” An iPod could be just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCZSDU"&gt;While Apple Music should be tightly integrated into a modern iPod, it would also be great if it could play music from other services, and if it had a totally Classic mode that just played files synced from a computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqksbh"&gt;Not only would opening the iPod up avoid some terrible optics for a company that’s being scrutinized by the government and competitors (like Spotify) for abusing its role as a platform and service designer, but it would also help avoid some of the weirdness that comes with streaming music. A lot of the times I use my iPod these days are because Apple Music is acting up, forcing me to restart the app because it claims that content is unauthorized, or completely fritzing out when trying to play the lossless music Apple recently introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgVvWG"&gt;(Seriously, is anyone else having this problem? Randomly, but very often, the song I’m trying to listen to will devolve into a flurry of high-pitched, digital-sounding squeals, like I’m listening to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6tFRzt-QvA"&gt;a 100 Gecs song&lt;/a&gt; playing on a Discman that’s being vigorously shaken.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjgX2T"&gt;Of course, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipod-touch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F4%2F22561092%2Fapple-bring-back-ipods-2021-music-services" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;does still sell an iPod&lt;/a&gt;, after all these years: the iPod Touch. Now, don’t get me wrong, the iPod Touch is a very good device, especially for children, and people who just want a non-expensive iOS device. But that’s just the thing — the iPod Touch isn’t a purpose-driven music player, it’s an iPhone without the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGVBSl"&gt;But so what? That just means it can use its headphone jack to listen to tunes from Apple Music, as well as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Prime Music, and anything else, as well as play games, surf the web, read books, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGdvcs"&gt;And that’s the rub for me: the iPod Touch is a good computing device, one that Apple should arguably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/28/18642381/apple-ipod-touch-update-iphone-7-processor"&gt;update more often&lt;/a&gt;, but sometimes the best tool for a job isn’t the one that can do everything. It’s the one that’s designed to do one thing really well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MjcC3m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPod Touch is a good device, but sometimes the best tool isn’t the one that can do everything&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XS8dx"&gt;For example, when I’m listening to music on an iOS device I often find that I’m not actually &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to the music, but scrolling through Twitter with it on in the background. That doesn’t happen with my 2006 iPod. The focus that comes with something that’s not offering you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU"&gt;everything, all of the time&lt;/a&gt;, is the same reason some people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444637/kobo-elipsa-e-reader-giant-screen-price-release-date-stylus"&gt;prefer e-readers&lt;/a&gt; over just reading on a tablet or phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3L4ka"&gt;And, practically speaking, making a dedicated portable music player without a smartphone OS and touchscreen would mean that Apple wasn’t competing as much with Android-powered players from the likes of &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/audio-components/hi-res-audio/p/nwa105-b"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Resolution-Lossless-Bluetooth-Spotify/dp/B07L8P8QDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fiio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8iK0s"&gt;There’s also the matter of hardware — if Apple made a new iPod designed for just listening to music, it wouldn’t have to make it powerful enough to run 3D games or Safari, and could instead put resources to a better DAC and amp (perhaps one that could play Apple Music’s aforementioned 24 bit, 192 kHz lossless files). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgxBsf"&gt;I don’t think that a new iPod would ever reach the dizzying heights of popularity that the older models did. Most people are perfectly content to listen to music on their phones — if they weren’t, Apple probably wouldn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/27/16050420/apple-ipod-nano-shuffle-discontinued"&gt;stopped selling iPods&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. However, Apple’s a big company — it could stand to make a niche, music-focused device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434783/apple-homepod-stock-problems-discontinued-sale"&gt;even if its last one didn’t do so well&lt;/a&gt;. And as an old iPod enthusiast, it coming out with a new one would be literal music to my ears (I had to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USYUkK"&gt;P.S. — I’ve also found the Apple Music experience on the Apple Watch to be pretty mediocre, and I don’t want to take my phone on a run. I’m not saying there’s room for an iPod Shuffle with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522993/apple-siri-on-device-speech-recognition-no-internet-wwdc"&gt;the new offline Siri&lt;/a&gt; instead of VoiceOver, but...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internal Apple survey shows concern about hybrid work model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VJ1sL_BooPYAjFRe2TFOW0P1_DQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534632/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GdAIoV"&gt;An internal survey designed by Apple employees shows respondents want the option to work from home and fear their colleagues may have to leave if the company forces people back to the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEnm38"&gt;In the survey, which was sent out in early June, nearly 90 percent of respondents said they “strongly agree” with the statement “location-flexible working options are a very important issue to me.” A total of 1,749 people answered the question. Employees defined “location-flexible” as the option to work from home indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKJjwy"&gt;The news comes on the heels of Tim Cook’s announcement that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple will be rolling out a new hybrid work model&lt;/a&gt; that will require employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. While the move is a big shift for Apple, which discouraged remote work prior to the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;it’s still too strict for some workers&lt;/a&gt;. They say that without the option to work from home whenever they want, some will be forced to resign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obip8K"&gt;The survey is not scientific — it was sent out in a Slack channel for employees to discuss remote work, and only a tiny fraction of Apple’s 147,000-person workforce likely even knew it existed. But the fact that well over a thousand employees participated in a grassroots survey that wasn’t sanctioned by Apple executives is significant. It hints at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a shift in Apple’s famously hierarchical culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvY73t"&gt;In response to the statement “I am worried that some of my colleagues will have to leave Apple due to LACK of location-flexible work options,” 58.5 percent said they “strongly agree.” A total of 1,743 people answered the question. A smaller portion — 36.7 percent — said they are worried &lt;em&gt;they’ll&lt;/em&gt; have to resign due to the lack of flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSIdpP"&gt;Employees sent the survey results to Cook and Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, on June 14th. They included a video with personal testimonies from 24 Apple workers on why remote working options are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nts8Qm"&gt;Two weeks later, Apple sent out a video &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;doubling down on the hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G19vHQ"&gt;The video irked some employees, who felt executives hadn’t listened to their perspective. Even employees who don’t want to work from home forever say the company needs to consider more flexibility while &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/world/asia/virus-delta-variant-global.html"&gt;the Delta variant continues to surge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4E0oqS"&gt;While Apple is encouraging employees to get vaccinated, it’s not requiring everyone to wear masks in the office, saying instead that “choosing to wear a mask in places where protocols have been lifted is a personal decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsKatx"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
